ISFP	 I.ANCESTRY--BIRTH--BOYHOOD.My family is American, and has been for generations, in all itsbranches, direct and collateral.Mathew Grant, the founder of the branch in America, of which I am adescendant, reached Dorchester, Massachusetts, in May, 1630.  In 1635 hemoved to what is now Windsor, Connecticut, and was the surveyor for thatcolony for more than forty years.  He was also, for many years of thetime, town clerk.  He was a married man when he arrived at Dorchester,but his children were all born in this country.  His eldest son, Samuel,took lands on the east side of the Connecticut River, opposite Windsor,which have been held and occupied by descendants of his to this day.I am of the eighth generation from Mathew Grant, and seventh fromSamuel.  Mathew Grant's first wife died a few years after theirsettlement in Windsor, and he soon after married the widow Rockwell,who, with her first husband, had been fellow-passengers with him and hisfirst wife, on the ship Mary and John, from Dorchester, England, in1630.  Mrs. Rockwell had several children by her first marriage, andothers by her second.  By intermarriage, two or three generations later,I am descended from both the wives of Mathew Grant.In the fifth descending generation my great grandfather, Noah Grant, andhis younger brother, Solomon, held commissions in the English army, in1756, in the war against the French and Indians.  Both were killed thatyear.My grandfather, also named Noah, was then but nine years old. At thebreaking out of the war of the Revolution, after the battles of Concordand Lexington, he went with a Connecticut company to join theContinental army, and was present at the battle of Bunker Hill.  Heserved until the fall of Yorktown, or through the entire Revolutionarywar.  He must, however, have been on furlough part of the time--as Ibelieve most of the soldiers of that period were--for he married inConnecticut during the war, had two children, and was a widower at theclose.  Soon after this he emigrated to Westmoreland County,Pennsylvania, and settled near the town of Greensburg in that county.He took with him the younger of his two children, Peter Grant.  Theelder, Solomon, remained with his relatives in Connecticut until oldenough to do for himself, when he emigrated to the British West Indies.Not long after his settlement in Pennsylvania, my grandfather, CaptainNoah Grant, married a Miss Kelly, and in 1799 he emigrated again, thistime to Ohio, and settled where the town of Deerfield now stands.  Hehad now five children, including Peter, a son by his first marriage.  Myfather, Jesse R. Grant, was the second child--oldest son, by the secondmarriage.Peter Grant went early to Maysville, Kentucky, where he was veryprosperous, married, had a family of nine children, and was drowned atthe mouth of the Kanawha River, Virginia, in 1825, being at the time oneof the wealthy men of the West.My grandmother Grant died in 1805, leaving seven children.  This brokeup the family.  Captain Noah Grant was not thrifty in the way of 'layingup stores on earth,' and, after the death of his second wife, he went,with the two youngest children, to live with his son Peter, inMaysville.  The rest of the family found homes in the neighborhood ofDeerfield, my father in the family of judge Tod, the father of the lateGovernor Tod, of Ohio.  His industry and independence of character weresuch, that I imagine his labor compensated fully for the expense of hismaintenance.There must have been a cordiality in his welcome into the Tod family,for to the day of his death he looked upon judge Tod and his wife, withall the reverence he could have felt if they had been parents instead ofbenefactors.  I have often heard him speak of Mrs. Tod as the mostadmirable woman he had ever known.  He remained with the Tod family onlya few years, until old enough to learn a trade.  He went first, Ibelieve, with his half-brother, Peter Grant, who, though not a tannerhimself, owned a tannery in Maysville, Kentucky.  Here he learned histrade, and in a few years returned to Deerfield and worked for, andlived in the family of a Mr. Brown, the father of John Brown--'whosebody lies mouldering in the grave, while his soul goes marching on.'  Ihave often heard my father speak of John Brown, particularly since theevents at Harper's Ferry.  Brown was a boy when they lived in the samehouse, but he knew him afterwards, and regarded him as a man of greatpurity of character, of high moral and physical courage, but a fanaticand extremist in whatever he advocated.  It was certainly the act of aninsane man to attempt the invasion of the South, and the overthrow ofslavery, with less than twenty men.My father set up for himself in business, establishing a tannery atRavenna, the county seat of Portage County.  In a few years he removedfrom Ravenna, and set up the same business at Point Pleasant, ClermontCounty, Ohio.During the minority of my father, the West afforded but poor facilitiesfor the most opulent of the youth to acquire an education, and themajority were dependent, almost exclusively, upon their own exertionsfor whatever learning they obtained.  I have often heard him say thathis time at school was limited to six months, when he was very young,too young, indeed, to learn much, or to appreciate the advantages of aneducation, and to a 'quarter's schooling' afterwards, probably whileliving with judge Tod.  But his thirst for education was intense.  Helearned rapidly, and was a constant reader up to the day of his death inhis eightieth year.  Books were scarce in the Western Reserve during hisyouth, but he read every book he could borrow in the neighborhood wherehe lived.  This scarcity gave him the early habit of studying everythinghe read, so that when he got through with a book, he knew everything init.  The habit continued through life.  Even after reading the dailypapers--which he never neglected--he could give all the importantinformation they contained.  He made himself an excellent Englishscholar, and before he was twenty years of age was a constantcontributor to Western newspapers, and was also, from that time until hewas fifty years old, an able debater in the societies for this purpose,which were common in the West at that time.  He always took an activepart in politics, but was never a candidate for office, except, Ibelieve, that he was the first Mayor of Georgetown.  He supportedJackson for the Presidency; but he was a Whig, a great admirer of HenryClay, and never voted for any other democrat for high office afterJackson.My mother's family lived in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, for severalgenerations.  I have little information about her ancestors.  Her familytook no interest in genealogy, so that my grandfather, who died when Iwas sixteen years old, knew only back to his grandfather.  On the otherside, my father took a great interest in the subject, and in hisresearches, he found that there was an entailed estate in Windsor,Connecticut, belonging to the family, to which his nephew, Lawson Grant--still living--was the heir.  He was so much interested in the subjectthat he got his nephew to empower him to act in the matter, and in 1832or 1833, when I was a boy ten or eleven years old, he went to Windsor,proved the title beyond dispute, and perfected the claim of the ownersfor a consideration--three thousand dollars, I think.  I remember thecircumstance well, and remember, too, hearing him say on his return thathe found some widows living on the property, who had little or nothingbeyond their homes.  From these he refused to receive any recompense.My mother's father, John Simpson, moved from Montgomery County,Pennsylvania, to Clermont County, Ohio, about the year 1819, taking withhim his four children, three daughters and one son.  My mother, HannahSimpson, was the third of these children, and was then over twenty yearsof age.  Her oldest sister was at that time married, and had severalchildren.  She still lives in Clermont County at this writing, October5th, 1884, and is over ninety ears of age.  Until her memory failed her,a few years ago, she thought the country ruined beyond recovery when theDemocratic party lost control in 1860.  Her family, which was large,inherited her views, with the exception of one son who settled inKentucky before the war.  He was the only one of the children whoentered the volunteer service to suppress the rebellion.Her brother, next of age and now past eighty-eight, is also still livingin Clermont County, within a few miles of the old homestead, and is asactive in mind as ever.  He was a supporter of the Government during thewar, and remains a firm believer, that national success by theDemocratic party means irretrievable ruin.In June, 1821, my father, Jesse R. Grant, married Hannah Simpson.  I wasborn on the 27th of April, 1822, at Point Pleasant, Clermont County,Ohio.  In the fall of 1823 we moved to Georgetown, the county seat ofBrown, the adjoining county east.  This place remained my home, until atthe age of seventeen, in 1839, I went to West Point.The schools, at the time of which I write, were very indifferent.  Therewere no free schools, and none in which the scholars were classified.They were all supported by subscription, and a single teacher--who wasoften a man or a woman incapable of teaching much, even if they impartedall they knew--would have thirty or forty scholars, male and female,from the infant learning the A B C's up to the young lady of eighteenand the boy of twenty, studying the highest branches taught--the threeR's, 'Reading, 'Riting, 'Rithmetic.'  I never saw an algebra, or othermathematical work higher than the arithmetic, in Georgetown, until afterI was appointed to West Point.  I then bought a work on algebra inCincinnati; but having no teacher it was Greek to me.My life in Georgetown was uneventful.  From the age of five or six untilseventeen, I attended the subscription schools of the village, exceptduring the winters of 1836-7 and 1838-9.  The former period was spent inMaysville, Kentucky, attending the school of Richardson and Rand; thelatter in Ripley, Ohio, at a private school.  I was not studious inhabit, and probably did not make progress enough to compensate for theoutlay for board and tuition.  At all events both winters were spent ingoing over the same old arithmetic which I knew every word of before,and repeating:  'A noun is the name of a thing,' which I had also heardmy Georgetown teachers repeat, until I had come to believe it--but Icast no reflections upon my old teacher, Richardson. He turned outbright scholars from his school, many of whom have filled conspicuousplaces in the service of their States.  Two of my contemporaries there--who, I believe, never attended any other institution of learning--haveheld seats in Congress, and one, if not both, other high offices; theseare Wadsworth and Brewster.My father was, from my earliest recollection, in comfortablecircumstances, considering the times, his place of residence, and thecommunity in which he lived.  Mindful of his own lack of facilities foracquiring an education, his greatest desire in maturer years was for theeducation of his children. Consequently, as stated before, I nevermissed a quarter from school from the time I was old enough to attendtill the time of leaving home.  This did not exempt me from labor.  Inmy early days, every one labored more or less, in the region where myyouth was spent, and more in proportion to their private means.  It wasonly the very poor who were exempt.  While my father carried on themanufacture of leather and worked at the trade himself, he owned andtilled considerable land.  I detested the trade, preferring almost anyother labor; but I was fond of agriculture, and of all employment inwhich horses were used.  We had, among other lands, fifty acres offorest within a mile of the village.  In the fall of the year chopperswere employed to cut enough wood to last a twelve-month.  When I wasseven or eight years of age, I began hauling all the wood used in thehouse and shops.  I could not load it on the wagons, of course, at thattime, but I could drive, and the choppers would load, and some one atthe house unload.  When about eleven years old, I was strong enough tohold a plough.  From that age until seventeen I did all the work donewith horses, such as breaking up the land, furrowing, ploughing corn andpotatoes, bringing in the crops when harvested, hauling all the wood,besides tending two or three horses, a cow or two, and sawing wood forstoves, etc., while still attending school.  For this I was compensatedby the fact that there was never any scolding or punishing by myparents; no objection to rational enjoyments, such as fishing, going tothe creek a mile away to swim in summer, taking a horse and visiting mygrandparents in the adjoining county, fifteen miles off, skating on theice in winter, or taking a horse and sleigh when there was snow on theground.While still quite young I had visited Cincinnati, forty-five miles away,several times, alone; also Maysville, Kentucky, often, and onceLouisville.  The journey to Louisville was a big one for a boy of thatday.  I had also gone once with a two-horse carriage to Chilicothe,about seventy miles, with a neighbor's family, who were removing toToledo, Ohio, and returned alone; and had gone once, in like manner, toFlat Rock, Kentucky, about seventy miles away.  On this latter occasionI was fifteen years of age.  While at Flat Rock, at the house of a Mr.Payne, whom I was visiting with his brother, a neighbor of ours inGeorgetown, I saw a very fine saddle horse, which I rather coveted, andproposed to Mr. Payne, the owner, to trade him for one of the two I wasdriving.  Payne hesitated to trade with a boy, but asking his brotherabout it, the latter told him that it would be all right, that I wasallowed to do as I pleased with the horses.  I was seventy miles fromhome, with a carriage to take back, and Mr. Payne said he did not knowthat his horse had ever had a collar on.  I asked to have him hitched toa farm wagon and we would soon see whether he would work.  It was soonevident that the horse had never worn harness before; but he showed noviciousness, and I expressed a confidence that I could manage him.  Atrade was at once struck, I receiving ten dollars difference.The next day Mr. Payne, of Georgetown, and I started on our return.  Wegot along very well for a few miles, when we encountered a ferocious dogthat frightened the horses and made them run.  The new animal kicked atevery jump he made.  I got the horses stopped, however, before anydamage was done, and without running into anything.  After giving them alittle rest, to quiet their fears, we started again.  That instant thenew horse kicked, and started to run once more.  The road we were on,struck the turnpike within half a mile of the point where the secondrunaway commenced, and there there was an embankment twenty or more feetdeep on the opposite side of the pike.  I got the horses stopped on thevery brink of the precipice.  My new horse was terribly frightened andtrembled like an aspen; but he was not half so badly frightened as mycompanion, Mr. Payne, who deserted me after this last experience, andtook passage on a freight wagon for Maysville.  Every time I attemptedto start, my new horse would commence to kick.  I was in quite a dilemmafor a time.  Once in Maysville I could borrow a horse from an uncle wholived there; but I was more than a day's travel from that point.Finally I took out my bandanna--the style of handkerchief in universaluse then--and with this blindfolded my horse.  In this way I reachedMaysville safely the next day, no doubt much to the surprise of myfriend.  Here I borrowed a horse from my uncle, and the following day weproceeded on our journey.About half my school-days in Georgetown were spent at the school of JohnD. White, a North Carolinian, and the father of Chilton White whorepresented the district in Congress for one term during the rebellion.Mr. White was always a Democrat in politics, and Chilton followed hisfather.  He had two older brothers--all three being school-mates of mineat their father's school--who did not go the same way.  The secondbrother died before the rebellion began; he was a Whig, and afterwards aRepublican.  His oldest brother was a Republican and brave soldierduring the rebellion.  Chilton is reported as having told of an earlierhorse-trade of mine.  As he told the story, there was a Mr. Ralstonliving within a few miles of the village, who owned a colt which I verymuch wanted.  My father had offered twenty dollars for it, but Ralstonwanted twenty-five.  I was so anxious to have the colt, that after theowner left, I begged to be allowed to take him at the price demanded.My father yielded, but said twenty dollars was all the horse was worth,and told me to offer that price; if it was not accepted I was to offertwenty-two and a half, and if that would not get him, to give thetwenty-five.  I at once mounted a horse and went for the colt.  When Igot to Mr. Ralston's house, I said to him:  'Papa says I may offer youtwenty dollars for the colt, but if you won't take that, I am to offertwenty-two and a half, and if you won't take that, to give youtwenty-five.'  It would not require a Connecticut man to guess the pricefinally agreed upon.  This story is nearly true.  I certainly showedvery plainly that I had come for the colt and meant to have him.  Icould not have been over eight years old at the time.  This transactioncaused me great heart-burning. The story got out among the boys of thevillage, and it was a long time before I heard the last of it.  Boysenjoy the misery of their companions, at least village boys in that daydid, and in later life I have found that all adults are not free fromthe peculiarity.  I kept the horse until he was four years old, when hewent blind, and I sold him for twenty dollars.  When I went to Maysvilleto school, in 1836, at the age of fourteen, I recognized my colt as oneof the blind horses working on the tread-wheel of the ferry-boat.I have describes enough of my early life to give an impression of thewhole.  I did not like to work; but I did as much of it, while young, asgrown men can be hired to do in these days, and attended school at thesame time.  I had as many privileges as any boy in the village, andprobably more than most of them.  I have no recollection of ever havingbeen punished at home, either by scolding or by the rod.  But at schoolthe case was different.  The rod was freely used there, and I was notexempt from its influence.  I can see John D. White--the school teacher--now, with his long beech switch always in his hand.  It was not alwaysthe same one, either.  Switches were brought in bundles, from a beechwood near the school house, by the boys for whose benefit they wereintended.  Often a whole bundle would be used up in a single day.  Inever had any hard feelings against my teacher, either while attendingthe school, or in later years when reflecting upon my experience.  Mr.White was a kindhearted man, and was much respected by the community inwhich he lived.  He only followed the universal custom of the period,and that under which he had received his own education.
ISFP	 II.WEST POINT--GRADUATION.In the winter of 1838-9 I was attending school at Ripley, only ten milesdistant from Georgetown, but spent the Christmas holidays at home.During this vacation my father received a letter from the HonorableThomas Morris, then United States Senator from Ohio.  When he read it hesaid to me, 'Ulysses, I believe you are going to receive theappointment.'  'What appointment?'  I inquired.  'To West Point; I haveapplied for it.'  'But I won't go,' I said.  He said he thought I would,AND I THOUGHT SO TOO, IF HE DID.  I really had no objection to going toWest Point, except that I had a very exalted idea of the acquirementsnecessary to get through.  I did not believe I possessed them, and couldnot bear the idea of failing.  There had been four boys from ourvillage, or its immediate neighborhood, who had been graduated from WESTJoint, and never a failure of any one appointed from Georgetown, exceptin the case of the one whose place I was to take.  He was the son of Dr.Bailey, our nearest and most intimate neighbor.  Young Bailey had beenappointed in 1837.  Finding before the January examination following,that he could not pass, he resigned and went to a private school, andremained there until the following year, when he was reappointed.Before the next examination he was dismissed.  Dr. Bailey was a proudand sensitive man, and felt the failure of his son so keenly that heforbade his return home.  There were no telegraphs in those days todisseminate news rapidly, no railroads west of the Alleghanies, and butfew east; and above all, there were no reporters prying into otherpeople's private affairs.  Consequently it did not become generallyknown that there was a vacancy at West Point from our district until Iwas appointed.  I presume Mrs. Bailey confided to my mother the factthat Bartlett had been dismissed, and that the doctor had forbidden hisson's return home.The Honorable Thomas L. Hamer, one of the ablest men Ohio ever produced,was our member of Congress at the time, and had the right of nomination.He and my father had been members of the same debating society (wherethey were generally pitted on opposite sides), and intimate personalfriends from their early manhood up to a few years before.  In politicsthey differed. Hamer was a life-long Democrat, while my father was aWhig. They had a warm discussion, which finally became angry--over someact of President Jackson, the removal of the deposit of public moneys, Ithink--after which they never spoke until after my appointment.  I knowboth of them felt badly over this estrangement, and would have been gladat any time to come to a reconciliation; but neither would make theadvance.  Under these circumstances my father would not write to Hamerfor the appointment, but he wrote to Thomas Morris, United StatesSenator from Ohio, informing him that there was a vacancy at West Pointfrom our district, and that he would be glad if I could be appointed tofill it.  This letter, I presume, was turned over to Mr. Hamer, and, asthere was no other applicant, he cheerfully appointed me.  This healedthe breach between the two, never after reopened.Besides the argument used by my father in favor of my going to WESTJoint--that 'he thought I would go'--there was another very stronginducement.  I had always a great desire to travel.  I was already thebest travelled boy in Georgetown, except the sons of one man, JohnWalker, who had emigrated to Texas with his family, and immigrated backas soon as he could get the means to do so.  In his short stay in Texashe acquired a very different opinion of the country from what one wouldform going there now.I had been east to Wheeling, Virginia, and north to the Western Reserve,in Ohio, west to Louisville, and south to Bourbon County, Kentucky,besides having driven or ridden pretty much over the whole countrywithin fifty miles of home.  Going to West Point would give me theopportunity of visiting the two great cities of the continent,Philadelphia and New York.  This was enough.  When these places werevisited I would have been glad to have had a steamboat or railroadcollision, or any other accident happen, by which I might have receiveda temporary injury sufficient to make me ineligible, for a time, toenter the Academy.  Nothing of the kind occurred, and I had to face themusic.Georgetown has a remarkable record for a western village.  It is, andhas been from its earliest existence, a democratic town.  There wasprobably no time during the rebellion when, if the opportunity couldhave been afforded, it would not have voted for Jefferson Davis forPresident of the United States, over Mr. Lincoln, or any otherrepresentative of his party; unless it was immediately after some ofJohn Morgan's men, in his celebrated raid through Ohio, spent a fewhours in the village.  The rebels helped themselves to whatever theycould find, horses, boots and shoes, especially horses, and many orderedmeals to be prepared for them by the families.  This was no doubt a farpleasanter duty for some families than it would have been to render alike service for Union soldiers.  The line between the Rebel and Unionelement in Georgetown was so marked that it led to divisions even in thechurches.  There were churches in that part of Ohio where treason waspreached regularly, and where, to secure membership, hostility to thegovernment, to the war and to the liberation of the slaves, was far moreessential than a belief in the authenticity or credibility of the Bible.There were men in Georgetown who filled all the requirements formembership in these churches.Yet this far-off western village, with a population, including old andyoung, male and female, of about one thousand--about enough for theorganization of a single regiment if all had been men capable of bearingarms--furnished the Union army four general officers and one colonel,West Point graduates, and nine generals and field officers ofVolunteers, that I can think of. Of the graduates from West Point, allhad citizenship elsewhere at the breaking out of the rebellion, exceptpossibly General A. V. Kautz, who had remained in the army from hisgraduation.  Two of the colonels also entered the service from otherlocalities.  The other seven, General McGroierty, Colonels White, Fyffe,Loudon and Marshall, Majors King and Bailey, were all residents ofGeorgetown when the war broke out, and all of them, who were alive atthe close, returned there.  Major Bailey was the cadet who had precededme at West Point.  He was killed in West Virginia, in his firstengagement.  As far as I know, every boy who has entered West Point fromthat village since my time has been graduated.I took passage on a steamer at Ripley, Ohio, for Pittsburg, about themiddle of May, 1839.  Western boats at that day did not make regulartrips at stated times, but would stop anywhere, and for any length oftime, for passengers or freight.  I have myself been detained two orthree days at a place after steam was up, the gang planks, all but one,drawn in, and after the time advertised for starting had expired.  Onthis occasion we had no vexatious delays, and in about three daysPittsburg was reached.  From Pittsburg I chose passage by the canal toHarrisburg, rather than by the more expeditious stage.  This gave abetter opportunity of enjoying the fine scenery of Western Pennsylvania,and I had rather a dread of reaching my destination at all.  At thattime the canal was much patronized by travellers, and, with thecomfortable packets of the period, no mode of conveyance could be morepleasant, when time was not an object.  From Harrisburg to Philadelphiathere was a railroad, the first I had ever seen, except the one on whichI had just crossed the summit of the Alleghany Mountains, and over whichcanal boats were transported.  In travelling by the road fromHarrisburg, I thought the perfection of rapid transit had been reached.We travelled at least eighteen miles an hour, when at full speed, andmade the whole distance averaging probably as much as twelve miles anhour.  This seemed like annihilating space.  I stopped five days inPhiladelphia, saw about every street in the city, attended the theatre,visited Girard College (which was then in course of construction), andgot reprimanded from home afterwards, for dallying by the way so long.My sojourn in New York was shorter, but long enough to enable me to seethe city very well.  I reported at West Point on the 30th or 31st ofMay, and about two weeks later passed my examination for admission,without difficulty, very much to my surprise.A military life had no charms for me, and I had not the faintest idea ofstaying in the army even if I should be graduated, which I did notexpect.  The encampment which preceded the commencement of academicstudies was very wearisome and uninteresting.  When the 28th of Augustcame--the date for breaking up camp and going into barracks--I felt asthough I had been at West Point always, and that if I staid tograduation, I would have to remain always.  I did not take hold of mystudies with avidity, in fact I rarely ever read over a lesson thesecond time during my entire cadetship.  I could not sit in my roomdoing nothing.  There is a fine library connected with the Academy fromwhich cadets can get books to read in their quarters.  I devoted moretime to these, than to books relating to the course of studies.  Much ofthe time, I am sorry to say, was devoted to novels, but not those of atrashy sort.  I read all of Bulwer's then published, Cooper's,Marryat's, Scott's, Washington Irving's works, Lever's, and many othersthat I do not now remember.  Mathematics was very easy to me, so thatwhen January came, I passed the examination, taking a good standing inthat branch.  In French, the only other study at that time in the firstyear's course, my standing was very low.  In fact, if the class had beenturned the other end foremost I should have been near head.  I neversucceeded in getting squarely at either end of my class, in any onestudy, during the four years.  I came near it in French, artillery,infantry and cavalry tactics, and conduct.Early in the session of the Congress which met in December, 1839, a billwas discussed abolishing the Military Academy.  I saw in this anhonorable way to obtain a discharge, and read the debates with muchinterest, but with impatience at the delay in taking action, for I wasselfish enough to favor the bill.  It never passed, and a year later,although the time hung drearily with me, I would have been sorry to haveseen it succeed.  My idea then was to get through the course, secure adetail for a few years as assistant professor of mathematics at theAcademy, and afterwards obtain a permanent position as professor in somerespectable college; but circumstances always did shape my coursedifferent from my plans.At the end of two years the class received the usual furlough, extendingfrom the close of the June examination to the 28th of August.  This Ienjoyed beyond any other period of my life.  My father had sold out hisbusiness in Georgetown--where my youth had been spent, and to which myday-dreams carried me back as my future home, if I should ever be ableto retire on a competency.  He had moved to Bethel, only twelve milesaway, in the adjoining county of Clermont, and had bought a young horsethat had never been in harness, for my special use under the saddleduring my furlough.  Most of my time was spent among my oldschool-mates--these ten weeks were shorter than one week at West Point.Persons acquainted with the Academy know that the corps of cadets isdivided into four companies for the purpose of military exercises.These companies are officered from the cadets, the superintendent andcommandant selecting the officers for their military bearing andqualifications.  The adjutant, quartermaster, four captains and twelvelieutenants are taken from the first, or Senior class; the sergeantsfrom the second, or junior class; and the corporals from the third, orSophomore class.  I had not been 'called out' as a corporal, but when Ireturned from furlough I found myself the last but one--about mystanding in all the tactics--of eighteen sergeants.  The promotion wastoo much for me.  That year my standing in the class--as shown by thenumber of demerits of the year--was about the same as it was among thesergeants, and I was dropped, and served the fourth year as a private.During my first year's encampment General Scott visited West Point, andreviewed the cadets.  With his commanding figure, his quite colossalsize and showy uniform, I thought him the finest specimen of manhood myeyes had ever beheld, and the most to be envied.  I could never resemblehim in appearance, but I believe I did have a presentiment for a momentthat some day I should occupy his place on review--although I had nointention then of remaining in the army.  My experience in a horse-tradeten years before, and the ridicule it caused me, were too fresh in mymind for me to communicate this presentiment to even my most intimatechum.  The next summer Martin Van Buren, then President of the UnitedStates, visited West Point and reviewed the cadets; he did not impressme with the awe which Scott had inspired.  In fact I regarded GeneralScott and Captain C. F. Smith, the Commandant of Cadets, as the two menmost to be envied in the nation.  I retained a high regard for both upto the day of their death.The last two years wore away more rapidly than the first two, but theystill seemed about five times as long as Ohio years, to me.  At last allthe examinations were passed, and the members of the class were calledupon to record their choice of arms of service and regiments.  I wasanxious to enter the cavalry, or dragoons as they were then called, butthere was only one regiment of dragoons in the Army at that time, andattached to that, besides the full complement of officers, there were atleast four brevet second lieutenants.  I recorded therefore my firstchoice, dragoons; second, 4th infantry; and got the latter.  Again therewas a furlough--or, more properly speaking, leave of absence for theclass were now commissioned officers--this time to the end of September.Again I went to Ohio to spend my vacation among my old school-mates; andagain I found a fine saddle horse purchased for my special use, besidesa horse and buggy that I could drive--but I was not in a physicalcondition to enjoy myself quite as well as on the former occasion.  Forsix months before graduation I had had a desperate cough ('Tyler's grip'it was called), and I was very much reduced, weighing but one hundredand seventeen pounds, just my weight at entrance, though I had grown sixinches in stature in the mean time.  There was consumption in myfather's family, two of his brothers having died of that disease, whichmade my symptoms more alarming.  The brother and sister next youngerthan myself died, during the rebellion, of the same disease, and Iseemed the most promising subject for it of the three in 1843.Having made alternate choice of two different arms of service withdifferent uniforms, I could not get a uniform suit until notified of myassignment.  I left my measurement with a tailor, with directions not tomake the uniform until I notified him whether it was to be for infantryor dragoons.  Notice did not reach me for several weeks, and then ittook at least a week to get the letter of instructions to the tailor andtwo more to make the clothes and have them sent to me.  This was a timeof great suspense.  I was impatient to get on my uniform and see how itlooked, and probably wanted my old school-mates, particularly the girls,to see me in it.The conceit was knocked out of me by two little circumstances thathappened soon after the arrival of the clothes, which gave me a distastefor military uniform that I never recovered from.  Soon after thearrival of the suit I donned it, and put off for Cincinnati onhorseback.  While I was riding along a street of that city, imaginingthat every one was looking at me, with a feeling akin to mine when Ifirst saw General Scott, a little urchin, bareheaded, footed, with dirtyand ragged pants held up by bare a single gallows--that's whatsuspenders were called then--and a shirt that had not seen a wash-tubfor weeks, turned to me and cried:  'Soldier! will you work?  No,sir--ee; I'll sell my shirt first!!' The horse trade and its direconsequences were recalled to mind.The other circumstance occurred at home.  Opposite our house in Bethelstood the old stage tavern where 'man and beast' found accommodation,The stable-man was rather dissipated, but possessed of some humor.  Onmy return I found him parading the streets, and attending in the stable,barefooted, but in a pair of sky-blue nankeen pantaloons--just the colorof my uniform trousers--with a strip of white cotton sheeting sewed downthe outside seams in imitation of mine.  The joke was a huge one in themind of many of the people, and was much enjoyed by them; but I did notappreciate it so highly.During the remainder of my leave of absence, my time was spent invisiting friends in Georgetown and Cincinnati, and occasionally othertowns in that part of the State.
ISFP	 III.ARMY LIFE--CAUSES OF THE MEXICAN WAR--CAMP SALUBRITY.On the 30th of September I reported for duty at Jefferson Barracks, St.Louis, with the 4th United States infantry.  It was the largest militarypost in the country at that time, being garrisoned by sixteen companiesof infantry, eight of the 3d regiment, the remainder of the 4th.Colonel Steven Kearney, one of the ablest officers of the day, commandedthe post, and under him discipline was kept at a high standard, butwithout vexatious rules or regulations.  Every drill and roll-call hadto be attended, but in the intervals officers were permitted to enjoythemselves, leaving the garrison, and going where they pleased, withoutmaking written application to state where they were going for how long,etc., so that they were back for their next duty.  It did seem to me, inmy early army days, that too many of the older officers, when they cameto command posts, made it a study to think what orders they couldpublish to annoy their subordinates and render them uncomfortable.  Inoticed, however, a few years later, when the Mexican war broke out,that most of this class of officers discovered they were possessed ofdisabilities which entirely incapacitated them for active field service.They had the moral courage to proclaim it, too.  They were right; butthey did not always give their disease the right name.At West Point I had a class-mate--in the last year of our studies he wasroom-mate also--F. T. Dent, whose family resided some five miles west ofJefferson Barracks.  Two of his unmarried brothers were living at homeat that time, and as I had taken with me from Ohio, my horse, saddle andbridle, I soon found my way out to White Haven, the name of the Dentestate.  As I found the family congenial my visits became frequent.There were at home, besides the young men, two daughters, one a schoolmiss of fifteen, the other a girl of eight or nine.  There was still anolder daughter of seventeen, who had been spending several years atboarding-school in St. Louis, but who, though through school, had notyet returned home.  She was spending the winter in the city withconnections, the family of Colonel John O'Fallon, well known in St.Louis.  In February she returned to her country home.  After that I donot know but my visits became more frequent; they certainly did becomemore enjoyable.  We would often take walks, or go on horseback to visitthe neighbors, until I became quite well acquainted in that vicinity.Sometimes one of the brothers would accompany us, sometimes one of theyounger sisters.  If the 4th infantry had remained at Jefferson Barracksit is possible, even probable, that this life might have continued forsome years without my finding out that there was anything serious thematter with me; but in the following May a circumstance occurred whichdeveloped my sentiment so palpably that there was no mistaking it.The annexation of Texas was at this time the subject of violentdiscussion in Congress, in the press, and by individuals.  Theadministration of President Tyler, then in power, was making the moststrenuous efforts to effect the annexation, which was, indeed, the greatand absorbing question of the day.  During these discussions the greaterpart of the single rifle regiment in the army--the 2d dragoons, whichhad been dismounted a year or two before, and designated 'DismountedRifles'--was stationed at Fort Jessup, Louisiana, some twenty-five mileseast of the Texas line, to observe the frontier.  About the 1st of Maythe 3d infantry was ordered from Jefferson Barracks to Louisiana, to gointo camp in the neighborhood of Fort Jessup, and there await furtherorders.  The troops were embarked on steamers and were on their way downthe Mississippi within a few days after the receipt of this order.About the time they started I obtained a leave of absence for twentydays to go to Ohio to visit my parents.  I was obliged to go to St.Louis to take a steamer for Louisville or Cincinnati, or the firststeamer going up the Ohio River to any point.  Before I left St. Louisorders were received at Jefferson Barracks for the 4th infantry tofollow the 3d.  A messenger was sent after me to stop my leaving; butbefore he could reach me I was off, totally ignorant of these events.  Aday or two after my arrival at Bethel I received a letter from aclassmate and fellow lieutenant in the 4th, informing me of thecircumstances related above, and advising me not to open any letter postmarked St. Louis or Jefferson Barracks, until the expiration of myleave, and saying that he would pack up my things and take them alongfor me.  His advice was not necessary, for no other letter was sent tome.  I now discovered that I was exceedingly anxious to get back toJefferson Barracks, and I understood the reason without explanation fromany one.  My leave of absence required me to report for duty, atJefferson Barracks, at the end of twenty days.  I knew my regiment hadgone up the Red River, but I was not disposed to break the letter of myleave; besides, if I had proceeded to Louisiana direct, I could not havereached there until after the expiration of my leave.  Accordingly, atthe end of the twenty days, I reported for duty to Lieutenant Ewell,commanding at Jefferson Barracks, handing him at the same time my leaveof absence.  After noticing the phraseology of the order--leaves ofabsence were generally worded, 'at the end of which time he will reportfor duty with his proper command'--he said he would give me an order tojoin my regiment in Louisiana.  I then asked for a few days' leavebefore starting, which he readily granted.  This was the same Ewell whoacquired considerable reputation as a Confederate general during therebellion.  He was a man much esteemed, and deservedly so, in the oldarmy, and proved himself a gallant and efficient officer in two wars--both in my estimation unholy.I immediately procured a horse and started for the country, taking nobaggage with me, of course.  There is an insignificant creek--theGravois--between Jefferson Barracks and the place to which I was going,and at that day there was not a bridge over it from its source to itsmouth.  There is not water enough in the creek at ordinary stages to runa coffee mill, and at low water there is none running whatever.  On thisoccasion it had been raining heavily, and, when the creek was reached, Ifound the banks full to overflowing, and the current rapid.  I looked atit a moment to consider what to do.  One of my superstitions had alwaysbeen when I started to go any where, or to do anything, not to turnback, or stop until the thing intended was accomplished.  I havefrequently started to go to places where I had never been and to which Idid not know the way, depending upon making inquiries on the road, andif I got past the place without knowing it, instead of turning back, Iwould go on until a road was found turning in the right direction, takethat, and come in by the other side.  So I struck into the stream, andin an instant the horse was swimming and I being carried down by thecurrent.  I headed the horse towards the other bank and soon reached it,wet through and without other clothes on that side of the stream.  Iwent on, however, to my destination and borrowed a dry suit from my--future--brother-in-law.  We were not of the same size, but the clothesanswered every purpose until I got more of my own.Before I returned I mustered up courage to make known, in the mostawkward manner imaginable, the discovery I had made on learning that the4th infantry had been ordered away from Jefferson Barracks.  The younglady afterwards admitted that she too, although until then she had neverlooked upon me other than as a visitor whose company was agreeable toher, had experienced a depression of spirits she could not account forwhen the regiment left.  Before separating it was definitely understoodthat at a convenient time we would join our fortunes, and not let theremoval of a regiment trouble us.  This was in May, 1844.  It was the22d of August, 1848, before the fulfilment of this agreement.  My dutieskept me on the frontier of Louisiana with the Army of Observation duringthe pendency of Annexation; and afterwards I was absent through the warwith Mexico, provoked by the action of the army, if not by theannexation itself. During that time there was a constant correspondencebetween Miss Dent and myself, but we only met once in the period of fouryears and three months.  In May, 1845, I procured a leave for twentydays, visited St. Louis, and obtained the consent of the parents for theunion, which had not been asked for before.As already stated, it was never my intention to remain in the army long,but to prepare myself for a professorship in some college.  Accordingly,soon after I was settled at Jefferson Barracks, I wrote a letter toProfessor Church--Professor of Mathematics at West Point--requesting himto ask my designation as his assistant, when next a detail had to bemade. Assistant professors at West Point are all officers of the army,supposed to be selected for their special fitness for the particularbranch of study they are assigned to teach.  The answer from ProfessorChurch was entirely satisfactory, and no doubt I should have beendetailed a year or two later but for the Mexican War coming on.Accordingly I laid out for myself a course of studies to be pursued ingarrison, with regularity, if not persistency.  I reviewed my West Pointcourse of mathematics during the seven months at Jefferson Barracks, andread many valuable historical works, besides an occasional novel.  Tohelp my memory I kept a book in which I would write up, from time totime, my recollections of all I had read since last posting it.  Whenthe regiment was ordered away, I being absent at the time, my effectswere packed up by Lieutenant Haslett, of the 4th infantry, and takenalong.  I never saw my journal after, nor did I ever keep another,except for a portion of the time while travelling abroad.  Often since afear has crossed my mind lest that book might turn up yet, and fall intothe hands of some malicious person who would publish it.  I know itsappearance would cause me as much heart-burning as my youthfulhorse-trade, or the later rebuke for wearing uniform clothes.The 3d infantry had selected camping grounds on the reservation at FortJessup, about midway between the Red River and the Sabine.  Our ordersrequired us to go into camp in the same neighborhood, and await furtherinstructions.  Those authorized to do so selected a place in the pinewoods, between the old town of Natchitoches and Grand Ecore, about threemiles from each, and on high ground back from the river.  The place wasgiven the name of Camp Salubrity, and proved entitled to it. The campwas on a high, sandy, pine ridge, with spring branches in the valley, infront and rear.  The springs furnished an abundance of cool, pure water,and the ridge was above the flight of mosquitoes, which abound in thatregion in great multitudes and of great voracity.  In the valley theyswarmed in myriads, but never came to the summit of the ridge.  Theregiment occupied this camp six months before the first death occurred,and that was caused by an accident.There was no intimation given that the removal of the 3d and 4thregiments of infantry to the western border of Louisiana was occasionedin any way by the prospective annexation of Texas, but it was generallyunderstood that such was the case. Ostensibly we were intended toprevent filibustering into Texas, but really as a menace to Mexico incase she appeared to contemplate war.  Generally the officers of thearmy were indifferent whether the annexation was consummated or not; butnot so all of them.  For myself, I was bitterly opposed to the measure,and to this day regard the war, which resulted, as one of the mostunjust ever waged by a stronger against a weaker nation.  It was aninstance of a republic following the bad example of European monarchies,in not considering justice in their desire to acquire additionalterritory.  Texas was originally a state belonging to the republic ofMexico.  It extended from the Sabine River on the east to the Rio Grandeon the west, and from the Gulf of Mexico on the south and east to theterritory of the United States and New Mexico--another Mexican state atthat time--on the north and west.  An empire in territory, it had but avery sparse population, until settled by Americans who had receivedauthority from Mexico to colonize. These colonists paid very littleattention to the supreme government, and introduced slavery into thestate almost from the start, though the constitution of Mexico did not,nor does it now, sanction that institution.  Soon they set up anindependent government of their own, and war existed, between Texas andMexico, in name from that time until 1836, when active hostilities verynearly ceased upon the capture of Santa Anna, the Mexican President.Before long, however, the same people--who with permission of Mexico hadcolonized Texas, and afterwards set up slavery there, and then secededas soon as they felt strong enough to do so--offered themselves and theState to the United States, and in 1845 their offer was accepted.  Theoccupation, separation and annexation were, from the inception of themovement to its final consummation, a conspiracy to acquire territoryout of which slave states might be formed for the American Union.Even if the annexation itself could be justified, the manner in whichthe subsequent war was forced upon Mexico cannot.  The fact is,annexationists wanted more territory than they could possibly lay anyclaim to, as part of the new acquisition. Texas, as an independentState, never had exercised jurisdiction over the territory between theNueces River and the Rio Grande. Mexico had never recognized theindependence of Texas, and maintained that, even if independent, theState had no claim south of the Nueces.  I am aware that a treaty, madeby the Texans with Santa Anna while he was under duress, ceded all theterritory between the Nueces and the Rio Grande--, but he was a prisonerof war when the treaty was made, and his life was in jeopardy.  He knew,too, that he deserved execution at the hands of the Texans, if theyshould ever capture him.  The Texans, if they had taken his life, wouldhave only followed the example set by Santa Anna himself a few yearsbefore, when he executed the entire garrison of the Alamo and thevillagers of Goliad.In taking military possession of Texas after annexation, the army ofoccupation, under General Taylor, was directed to occupy the disputedterritory.  The army did not stop at the Nueces and offer to negotiatefor a settlement of the boundary question, but went beyond, apparentlyin order to force Mexico to initiate war.  It is to the credit of theAmerican nation, however, that after conquering Mexico, and whilepractically holding the country in our possession, so that we could haveretained the whole of it, or made any terms we chose, we paid a roundsum for the additional territory taken; more than it was worth, or waslikely to be, to Mexico.  To us it was an empire and of incalculablevalue; but it might have been obtained by other means.  The Southernrebellion was largely the outgrowth of the Mexican war.  Nations, likeindividuals, are punished for their transgressions.  We got ourpunishment in the most sanguinary and expensive war of modern times.The 4th infantry went into camp at Salubrity in the month of May, 1844,with instructions, as I have said, to await further orders.  At first,officers and men occupied ordinary tents.  As the summer heat increasedthese were covered by sheds to break the rays of the sun.  The summerwas whiled away in social enjoyments among the officers, in visitingthose stationed at, and near, Fort Jessup, twenty-five miles away,visiting the planters on the Red River, and the citizens of Natchitochesand Grand Ecore.  There was much pleasant intercourse between theinhabitants and the officers of the army.  I retain very agreeablerecollections of my stay at Camp Salubrity, and of the acquaintancesmade there, and no doubt my feeling is shared by the few officers livingwho were there at the time.  I can call to mind only two officers of the4th infantry, besides myself, who were at Camp Salubrity with theregiment, who are now alive.With a war in prospect, and belonging to a regiment that had an unusualnumber of officers detailed on special duty away from the regiment, myhopes of being ordered to West Point as instructor vanished.  At thetime of which I now write, officers in the quartermaster's, commissary'sand adjutant--general's departments were appointed from the line of thearmy, and did not vacate their regimental commissions until theirregimental and staff commissions were for the same grades.  Generallylieutenants were appointed to captaincies to fill vacancies in the staffcorps.  If they should reach a captaincy in the line before they arrivedat a majority in the staff, they would elect which commission they wouldretain.  In the 4th infantry, in 1844, at least six line officers wereon duty in the staff, and therefore permanently detached from theregiment.  Under these circumstances I gave up everything like a specialcourse of reading, and only read thereafter for my own amusement, andnot very much for that, until the war was over.  I kept a horse androde, and staid out of doors most of the time by day, and entirelyrecovered from the cough which I had carried from West Point, and fromall indications of consumption.  I have often thought that my life wassaved, and my health restored, by exercise and exposure, enforced by anadministrative act, and a war, both of which I disapproved.As summer wore away, and cool days and colder nights came upon us, thetents. We were occupying ceased to afford comfortable quarters; and'further orders' not reaching us, we began to look about to remedy thehardship.  Men were put to work getting out timber to build huts, and ina very short time all were comfortably housed--privates as well asofficers.  The outlay by the government in accomplishing this wasnothing, or nearly nothing.  The winter was spent more agreeably thanthe summer had been.  There were occasional parties given by theplanters along the 'coast'--as the bottom lands on the Red River werecalled.  The climate was delightful.Near the close of the short session of Congress of 1844-5, the bill forthe annexation of Texas to the United States was passed.  It reachedPresident Tyler on the 1st of March, 1845, and promptly received hisapproval.  When the news reached us we began to look again for 'furtherorders.'  They did not arrive promptly, and on the 1st of May followingI asked and obtained a leave of absence for twenty days, for the purposeof visiting--St. Louis.  The object of this visit has been beforestated.Early in July the long expected orders were received, but they only tookthe regiment to New Orleans Barracks.  We reached there before themiddle of the month, and again waited weeks for still further orders.The yellow fever was raging in New Orleans during the time we remainedthere, and the streets of the city had the appearance of a continuouswell-observed Sunday.  I recollect but one occasion when this observanceseemed to be broken by the inhabitants.  One morning about daylight Ihappened to be awake, and, hearing the discharge of a rifle not far off,I looked out to ascertain where the sound came from.  I observed acouple of clusters of men near by, and learned afterwards that 'it wasnothing; only a couple of gentlemen deciding a difference of opinionwith rifles, at twenty paces.'  I do not remember if either was killed,or even hurt, but no doubt the question of difference was settledsatisfactorily, and 'honorably,' in the estimation of the partiesengaged.  I do not believe I ever would have the courage to fight aduel.  If any man should wrong me to the extent of my being willing tokill him, I would not be willing to give him the choice of weapons withwhich it should be done, and of the time, place and distance separatingus, when I executed him.  If I should do another such a wrong as tojustify him in killing me, I would make any reasonable atonement withinmy power, if convinced of the wrong done.  I place my opposition toduelling on higher grounds than here stated.  No doubt a majority of theduels fought have been for want of moral courage on the part of thoseengaged to decline.At Camp Salubrity, and when we went to New Orleans Barracks, the 4thinfantry was commanded by Colonel Vose, then an old gentleman who hadnot commanded on drill for a number of years.  He was not a man todiscover infirmity in the presence of danger.  It now appeared that warwas imminent, and he felt that it was his duty to brush up his tactics.Accordingly, when we got settled down at our new post, he took commandof the regiment at a battalion drill.  Only two or three evolutions hadbeen gone through when he dismissed the battalion, and, turning to go tohis own quarters, dropped dead.  He had not been complaining of illhealth, but no doubt died of heart disease.  He was a most estimableman, of exemplary habits, and by no means the author of his own disease.
ISFP	 IV.CORPUS CHRISTI--MEXICAN SMUGGLING--SPANISH RULE IN MEXICO--SUPPLYINGTRANSPORTATION.Early in September the regiment left New Orleans for Corpus Christi, nowin Texas.  Ocean steamers were not then common, and the passage was madein sailing vessels.  At that time there was not more than three feet ofwater in the channel at the outlet of Corpus Christi Bay; thedebarkation, therefore, had to take place by small steamers, and at anisland in the channel called Shell Island, the ships anchoring somemiles out from shore. This made the work slow, and as the army was onlysupplied with one or two steamers, it took a number of days to effectthe landing of a single regiment with its stores, camp and garrisonequipage, etc.  There happened to be pleasant weather while this wasgoing on, but the land-swell was so great that when the ship and steamerwere on opposite sides of the same wave they would be at considerabledistance apart.  The men and baggage were let down to a point higherthan the lower deck of the steamer, and when ship and steamer got intothe trough between the waves, and were close together, the load would bedrawn over the steamer and rapidly run down until it rested on the deck.After I had gone ashore, and had been on guard several days at ShellIsland, quite six miles from the ship, I had occasion for some reason orother to return on board.  While on the Suviah--I think that was thename of our vessel--I heard a tremendous racket at the other end of theship, and much and excited sailor language, such as 'damn your eyes,'etc.  In a moment or two the captain, who was an excitable little man,dying with consumption, and not weighing much over a hundred pounds,came running out, carrying a sabre nearly as large and as heavy as hewas, and crying, that his men had mutinied.  It was necessary to sustainthe captain without question, and in a few minutes all the sailorscharged with mutiny were in irons.  I rather felt for a time a wish thatI had not gone aboard just then.  As the men charged with mutinysubmitted to being placed in irons without resistance, I always doubtedif they knew that they had mutinied until they were told.By the time I was ready to leave the ship again I thought I had learnedenough of the working of the double and single pulley, by whichpassengers were let down from the upper deck of the ship to the steamerbelow, and determined to let myself down without assistance.  Withoutsaying anything of my intentions to any one, I mounted the railing, andtaking hold of the centre rope, just below the upper block, I put onefoot on the hook below the lower block, and stepped off just as I did sosome one called out 'hold on.'  It was too late.  I tried to 'hold on'with all my might, but my heels went up, and my head went down sorapidly that my hold broke, and I plunged head foremost into the water,some twenty-five feet below, with such velocity that it seemed to me Inever would stop.  When I came to the surface again, being a fairswimmer, and not having lost my presence of mind, I swam around until abucket was let down for me, and I was drawn up without a scratch orinjury. I do not believe there was a man on board who sympathized withme in the least when they found me uninjured.  I rather enjoyed the jokemyself. The captain of the Suviah died of his disease a few months later,and I believe before the mutineers were tried.  I hope they got clear,because, as before stated, I always thought the mutiny was all in thebrain of a very weak and sick man.After reaching shore, or Shell Island, the labor of getting to CorpusChristi was slow and tedious.  There was, if my memory serves me, butone small steamer to transport troops and baggage when the 4th infantryarrived.  Others were procured later.  The distance from Shell Island toCorpus Christi was some sixteen or eighteen miles.  The channel to thebay was so shallow that the steamer, small as it was, had to be draggedover the bottom when loaded.  Not more than one trip a day could beeffected.  Later this was remedied, by deepening the channel andincreasing the number of vessels suitable to its navigation.Corpus Christi is near the head of the bay of the same name, formed bythe entrance of the Nueces River into tide-water, and is on the westbank of that bay.  At the time of its first occupancy by United Statestroops there was a small Mexican hamlet there, containing probably lessthan one hundred souls. There was, in addition, a small American tradingpost, at which goods were sold to Mexican smugglers.  All goods were putup in compact packages of about one hundred pounds each, suitable forloading on pack mules.  Two of these packages made a load for anordinary Mexican mule, and three for the larger ones.  The bulk of thetrade was in leaf tobacco, and domestic cotton-cloths and calicoes.  TheMexicans had, before the arrival of the army, but little to offer inexchange except silver.  The trade in tobacco was enormous, consideringthe population to be supplied.  Almost every Mexican above the age often years, and many much younger, smoked the cigarette.  Nearly everyMexican carried a pouch of leaf tobacco, powdered by rolling in thehands, and a roll of corn husks to make wrappers.  The cigarettes weremade by the smokers as they used them.Up to the time of which I write, and for years afterwards--I think untilthe administration of President Juarez--the cultivation, manufacture andsale of tobacco constituted a government monopoly, and paid the bulk ofthe revenue collected from internal sources.  The price was enormouslyhigh, and made successful smuggling very profitable.  The difficulty ofobtaining tobacco is probably the reason why everybody, male and female,used it at that time.  I know from my own experience that when I was atWest Point, the fact that tobacco, in every form, was prohibited, andthe mere possession of the weed severely punished, made the majority ofthe cadets, myself included, try to acquire the habit of using it.  Ifailed utterly at the time and for many years afterward; but themajority accomplished the object of their youthful ambition.Under Spanish rule Mexico was prohibited from producing anything thatthe mother-country could supply.  This rule excluded the cultivation ofthe grape, olive and many other articles to which the soil and climatewere well adapted.  The country was governed for 'revenue only;' andtobacco, which cannot be raised in Spain, but is indigenous to Mexico,offered a fine instrumentality for securing this prime object ofgovernment.  The native population had been in the habit of using 'theweed' from a period, back of any recorded history of this continent.Bad habits--if not restrained by law or public opinion--spread morerapidly and universally than good ones, and the Spanish colonistsadopted the use of tobacco almost as generally as the natives.  Spain,therefore, in order to secure the largest revenue from this source,prohibited the cultivation, except in specified localities--and in theseplaces farmed out the privilege at a very high price.  The tobacco whenraised could only be sold to the government, and the price to theconsumer was limited only by the avarice of the authorities, and thecapacity of the people to pay.All laws for the government of the country were enacted in Spain, andthe officers for their execution were appointed by the Crown, and sentout to the New El Dorado.  The Mexicans had been brought up ignorant ofhow to legislate or how to rule. When they gained their independence,after many years of war, it was the most natural thing in the world thatthey should adopt as their own the laws then in existence.  The onlychange was, that Mexico became her own executor of the laws and therecipient of the revenues.  The tobacco tax, yielding so large a revenueunder the law as it stood, was one of the last, if not the very last, ofthe obnoxious imposts to be repealed.  Now, the citizens are allowed tocultivate any crops the soil will yield.  Tobacco is cheap, and everyquality can be produced. Its use is by no means so general as when Ifirst visited the country.Gradually the 'Army of Occupation' assembled at Corpus Christi.  When itwas all together it consisted of seven companies of the 2d regiment ofdragoons, four companies of light artillery, five regiments of infantry--the 3d, 4th, 5th, 7th and 8th--and one regiment of artillery acting asinfantry--not more than three thousand men in all.  General ZacharyTaylor commanded the whole.  There were troops enough in one body toestablish a drill and discipline sufficient to fit men and officers forall they were capable of in case of battle.  The rank and file werecomposed of men who had enlisted in time of peace, to serve for sevendollars a month, and were necessarily inferior as material to theaverage volunteers enlisted later in the war expressly to fight, andalso to the volunteers in the war for the preservation of the Union.The men engaged in the Mexican war were brave, and the officers of theregular army, from highest to lowest, were educated in their profession.A more efficient army for its number and armament, I do not believe everfought a battle than the one commanded by General Taylor in his firsttwo engagements on Mexican--or Texan soil.The presence of United States troops on the edge of the disputedterritory furthest from the Mexican settlements, was not sufficient toprovoke hostilities.  We were sent to provoke a fight, but it wasessential that Mexico should commence it.  It was very doubtful whetherCongress would declare war; but if Mexico should attack our troops, theExecutive could announce, 'Whereas, war exists by the acts of, etc.,'and prosecute the contest with vigor.  Once initiated there were but fewpublic men who would have the courage to oppose it.  Experience provesthat the man who obstructs a war in which his nation is engaged, nomatter whether right or wrong, occupies no enviable place in life orhistory.  Better for him, individually, to advocate 'war, pestilence,and famine,' than to act as obstructionist to a war already begun.  Thehistory of the defeated rebel will be honorable hereafter, compared withthat of the Northern man who aided him by conspiring against hisgovernment while protected by it.  The most favorable posthumous historythe stay-at-home traitor can hope for is--oblivion.Mexico showing no willingness to come to the Nueces to drive theinvaders from her soil, it became necessary for the 'invaders' toapproach to within a convenient distance to be struck. Accordingly,preparations were begun for moving the army to the Rio Grande, to apoint near Matamoras.  It was desirable to occupy a position near thelargest centre of population possible to reach, without absolutelyinvading territory to which we set up no claim whatever.The distance from Corpus Christi to Matamoras is about one hundred andfifty miles.  The country does not abound in fresh water, and the lengthof the marches had to be regulated by the distance between watersupplies.  Besides the streams, there were occasional pools, filledduring the rainy season, some probably made by the traders, whotravelled constantly between Corpus Christi and the Rio Grande, and someby the buffalo. There was not at that time a single habitation,cultivated field, or herd of domestic animals, between Corpus Christiand Matamoras.  It was necessary, therefore, to have a wagon trainsufficiently large to transport the camp and garrison equipage,officers' baggage, rations for the army, and part rations of grain forthe artillery horses and all the animals taken from the north, wherethey had been accustomed to having their forage furnished them.  Thearmy was but indifferently supplied with transportation.  Wagons andharness could easily be supplied from the north but mules and horsescould not so readily be brought.  The American traders and Mexicansmugglers came to the relief.  Contracts were made for mules at fromeight to eleven dollars each.  The smugglers furnished the animals, andtook their pay in goods of the description before mentioned.  I doubtwhether the Mexicans received in value from the traders five dollars perhead for the animals they furnished, and still more, whether they paidanything but their own time in procuring them.  Such is trade; such iswar.  The government paid in hard cash to the contractor the stipulatedprice.Between the Rio Grande and the Nueces there was at that time a largeband of wild horses feeding; as numerous, probably, as the band ofbuffalo roaming further north was before its rapid exterminationcommenced.  The Mexicans used to capture these in large numbers andbring them into the American settlements and sell them.  A picked animalcould be purchased at from eight to twelve dollars, but taken atwholesale, they could be bought for thirty-six dollars a dozen.  Some ofthese were purchased for the army, and answered a most useful purpose.The horses were generally very strong, formed much like the Normanhorse, and with very heavy manes and tails.  A number of officerssupplied themselves with these, and they generally rendered as usefulservice as the northern animal in fact they were much better whengrazing was the only means of supplying forage.There was no need for haste, and some months were consumed in thenecessary preparations for a move.  In the meantime the army was engagedin all the duties pertaining to the officer and the soldier.  Twice,that I remember, small trains were sent from Corpus Christi, withcavalry escorts, to San Antonio and Austin, with paymasters and funds topay off small detachments of troops stationed at those places.  GeneralTaylor encouraged officers to accompany these expeditions.  Iaccompanied one of them in December, 1845.  The distance from CorpusChristi to San Antonio was then computed at one hundred and fifty miles.Now that roads exist it is probably less.  From San Antonio to Austin wecomputed the distance at one hundred and ten miles, and from the latterplace back to Corpus Christi at over two hundred miles.  I know thedistance now from San Antonio to Austin is but little over eighty miles,so that our computation was probably too high.There was not at the time an individual living between Corpus Christiand San Antonio until within about thirty miles of the latter point,where there were a few scattering Mexican settlements along the SanAntonio River.  The people in at least one of these hamlets livedunderground for protection against the Indians.  The country abounded ingame, such as deer and antelope, with abundance of wild turkeys alongthe streams and where there were nut-bearing woods.  On the Nueces,about twenty-five miles up from Corpus Christi, were a few log cabins,the remains of a town called San Patricio, but the inhabitants had allbeen massacred by the Indians, or driven away.San Antonio was about equally divided in population between Americansand Mexicans.  From there to Austin there was not a single residenceexcept at New Braunfels, on the Guadalupe River.  At that point was asettlement of Germans who had only that year come into the State.  Atall events they were living in small huts, about such as soldiers wouldhastily construct for temporary occupation.  From Austin to CorpusChristi there was only a small settlement at Bastrop, with a few farmsalong the Colorado River; but after leaving that, there were nosettlements except the home of one man, with one female slave, at theold town of Goliad.  Some of the houses were still standing.  Goliad hadbeen quite a village for the period and region, but some years beforethere had been a Mexican massacre, in which every inhabitant had beenkilled or driven away.  This, with the massacre of the prisoners in theAlamo, San Antonio, about the same time, more than three hundred men inall, furnished the strongest justification the Texans had for carryingon the war with so much cruelty.  In fact, from that time until theMexican war, the hostilities between Texans and Mexicans was so greatthat neither was safe in the neighborhood of the other who might be insuperior numbers or possessed of superior arms.  The man we found livingthere seemed like an old friend; he had come from near Fort Jessup,Louisiana, where the officers of the 3d and 4th infantry and the 2ddragoons had known him and his family.  He had emigrated in advance ofhis family to build up a home for them.
ISFP	 V.TRIP TO AUSTIN--PROMOTION TO FULL SECOND LIEUTENANT--ARMY OF OCCUPATION.When our party left Corpus Christi it was quite large, including thecavalry escort, Paymaster, Major Dix, his clerk and the officers who,like myself, were simply on leave; but all the officers on leave, exceptLieutenant Benjamin--afterwards killed in the valley of Mexico--Lieutenant, now General, Augur, and myself, concluded to spend theirallotted time at San Antonio and return from there.  We were all to beback at Corpus Christi by the end of the month.  The paymaster wasdetained in Austin so long that, if we had waited for him, we would haveexceeded our leave.  We concluded, therefore, to start back at once withthe animals we had, and having to rely principally on grass for theirfood, it was a good six days' journey.  We had to sleep on the prairieevery night, except at Goliad, and possibly one night on the Colorado,without shelter and with only such food as we carried with us, andprepared ourselves.  The journey was hazardous on account of Indians,and there were white men in Texas whom I would not have cared to meet ina secluded place. Lieutenant Augur was taken seriously sick before wereached Goliad and at a distance from any habitation.  To add to thecomplication, his horse--a mustang that had probably been captured fromthe band of wild horses before alluded to, and of undoubted longevity athis capture--gave out. It was absolutely necessary to get for ward toGoliad to find a shelter for our sick companion.  By dint of patienceand exceedingly slow movements, Goliad was at last reached, and ashelter and bed secured for our patient.  We remained over a day, hopingthat Augur might recover sufficiently to resume his travels.  He didnot, however, and knowing that Major Dix would be along in a few days,with his wagon-train, now empty, and escort, we arranged with ourLouisiana friend to take the best of care of the sick lieutenant untilthus relieved, and went on.I had never been a sportsman in my life; had scarcely ever gone insearch of game, and rarely seen any when looking for it.  On this tripthere was no minute of time while travelling between San Patricio andthe settlements on the San Antonio River, from San Antonio to Austin,and again from the Colorado River back to San Patricio, when deer orantelope could not be seen in great numbers. Each officer carried ashot-gun, and every evening, after going into camp, some would go outand soon return with venison and wild turkeys enough for the entirecamp.  I, however, never went out, and had no occasion to fire my gun;except, being detained over a day at Goliad, Benjamin and I concluded togo down to the creek--which was fringed with timber, much of it thepecan--and bring back a few turkeys.  We had scarcely reached the edgeof the timber when I heard the flutter of wings overhead, and in aninstant I saw two or three turkeys flying away.  These were soonfollowed by more, then more, and more, until a flock of twenty or thirtyhad left from just over my head.  All this time I stood watching theturkeys to see where they flew--with my gun on my shoulder, and neveronce thought of levelling it at the birds.  When I had time to reflectupon the matter, I came to the conclusion that as a sportsman I was afailure, and went back to the house.  Benjamin remained out, and got asmany turkeys as he wanted to carry back.After the second night at Goliad, Benjamin and I started to make theremainder of the journey alone.  We reached Corpus Christi just in timeto avoid 'absence without leave.'  We met no one not even an Indian--during the remainder of our journey, except at San Patricio.  A newsettlement had been started there in our absence of three weeks, inducedpossibly by the fact that there were houses already built, while theproximity of troops gave protection against the Indians.  On the eveningof the first day out from Goliad we heard the most unearthly howling ofwolves, directly in our front.  The prairie grass was tall and we couldnot see the beasts, but the sound indicated that they were near.  To myear it appeared that there must have been enough of them to devour ourparty, horses and all, at a single meal.  The part of Ohio that I hailedfrom was not thickly settled, but wolves had been driven out long beforeI left.  Benjamin was from Indiana, still less populated, where the wolfyet roamed over the prairies.  He understood the nature of the animaland the capacity of a few to make believe there was an unlimited numberof them.  He kept on towards the noise, unmoved.  I followed in histrail, lacking moral courage to turn back and join our sick companion.I have no doubt that if Benjamin had proposed returning to Goliad, Iwould not only have 'seconded the motion' but have suggested that itwas very hard-hearted in us to leave Augur sick there in the firstplace; but Benjamin did not propose turning back.  When he did speak itwas to ask: 'Grant, how many wolves do you think there are in thatpack?' Knowing where he was from, and suspecting that he thought I wouldover-estimate the number, I determined to show my acquaintance with theanimal by putting the estimate below what possibly could be correct, andanswered:  'Oh, about twenty,' very indifferently.  He smiled and rodeon.  In a minute we were close upon them, and before they saw us.  Therewere just TWO of them.  Seated upon their haunches, with their mouthsclose together, they had made all the noise we had been hearing for thepast ten minutes.  I have often thought of this incident since when Ihave heard the noise of a few disappointed politicians who had desertedtheir associates.  There are always more of them before they arecounted.A week or two before leaving Corpus Christi on this trip, I had beenpromoted from brevet second-lieutenant, 4th infantry, to fullsecond-lieutenant, 7th infantry.  Frank Gardner,(*1) of the 7th, waspromoted to the 4th in the same orders.  We immediately made applicationto be transferred, so as to get back to our old regiments.  On myreturn, I found that our application had been approved at Washington.While in the 7th infantry I was in the company of Captain Holmes,afterwards a Lieutenant-general in the Confederate army. I never came incontact with him in the war of the Rebellion, nor did he render any veryconspicuous service in his high rank.  My transfer carried me to thecompany of Captain McCall, who resigned from the army after the Mexicanwar and settled in Philadelphia.  He was prompt, however, to volunteerwhen the rebellion broke out, and soon rose to the rank of major-generalin the Union army.  I was not fortunate enough to meet him after heresigned. In the old army he was esteemed very highly as a soldier andgentleman. Our relations were always most pleasant.The preparations at Corpus Christi for an advance progressed as rapidlyin the absence of some twenty or more lieutenants as if we had beenthere.  The principal business consisted in securing mules, and gettingthem broken to harness.  The process was slow but amusing.  The animalssold to the government were all young and unbroken, even to the saddle,and were quite as wild as the wild horses of the prairie.  Usually anumber would be brought in by a company of Mexicans, partners in thedelivery.  The mules were first driven into a stockade, called a corral,inclosing an acre or more of ground.  The Mexicans,--who were allexperienced in throwing the lasso,--would go into the corral onhorseback, with their lassos attached to the pommels of their saddles.Soldiers detailed as teamsters and black smiths would also enter thecorral, the former with ropes to serve as halters, the latter withbranding irons and a fire to keep the irons heated.  A lasso was thenthrown over the neck of a mule, when he would immediately go to thelength of his tether, first one end, then the other in the air.  Whilehe was thus plunging and gyrating, another lasso would be thrown byanother Mexican, catching the animal by a fore-foot.  This would bringthe mule to the ground, when he was seized and held by the teamsterswhile the blacksmith put upon him, with hot irons, the initials 'U. S.'Ropes were then put about the neck, with a slipnoose which would tightenaround the throat if pulled.  With a man on each side holding theseropes, the mule was released from his other bindings and allowed torise.  With more or less difficulty he would be conducted to a picketrope outside and fastened there.  The delivery of that mule was thencomplete. This process was gone through with every mule and wild horsewith the army of occupation.The method of breaking them was less cruel and much more amusing.  It isa well-known fact that where domestic animals are used for specificpurposes from generation to generation, the descendants are easily, as arule, subdued to the same uses.  At that time in Northern Mexico themule, or his ancestors, the horse and the ass, was seldom used exceptfor the saddle or pack.  At all events the Corpus Christi mule resistedthe new use to which he was being put.  The treatment he was subjectedto in order to overcome his prejudices was summary and effective.The soldiers were principally foreigners who had enlisted in our largecities, and, with the exception of a chance drayman among them, it isnot probable that any of the men who reported themselves as competentteamsters had ever driven a mule-team in their lives, or indeed thatmany had had any previous experience in driving any animal whatever toharness.  Numbers together can accomplish what twice their number actingindividually could not perform.  Five mules were allotted to each wagon.A teamster would select at the picket rope five animals of nearly thesame color and general appearance for his team.  With a full corps ofassistants, other teamsters, he would then proceed to get his mulestogether.  In two's the men would approach each animal selected,avoiding as far as possible its heels.  Two ropes would be put about theneck of each animal, with a slip noose, so that he could be choked iftoo unruly.  They were then led out, harnessed by force and hitched tothe wagon in the position they had to keep ever after.  Two men remainedon either side of the leader, with the lassos about its neck, and oneman retained the same restraining influence over each of the others.All being ready, the hold would be slackened and the team started. Thefirst motion was generally five mules in the air at one time, backsbowed, hind feet extended to the rear.  After repeating this movement afew times the leaders would start to run.  This would bring thebreeching tight against the mules at the wheels, which these last seemedto regard as a most unwarrantable attempt at coercion and would resistby taking a seat, sometimes going so far as to lie down.  In time allwere broken in to do their duty submissively if not cheerfully, butthere never was a time during the war when it was safe to let a Mexicanmule get entirely loose.  Their drivers were all teamsters by the timethey got through.I recollect one case of a mule that had worked in a team under thesaddle, not only for some time at Corpus Christi, where he was broken,but all the way to the point opposite Matamoras, then to Camargo, wherehe got loose from his fastenings during the night.  He did not run awayat first, but staid in the neighborhood for a day or two, coming upsometimes to the feed trough even; but on the approach of the teamsterhe always got out of the way.  At last, growing tired of the constanteffort to catch him, he disappeared altogether.  Nothing short of aMexican with his lasso could have caught him.  Regulations would nothave warranted the expenditure of a dollar in hiring a man with a lassoto catch that mule; but they did allow the expenditure 'of the mule,' ona certificate that he had run away without any fault of thequartermaster on whose returns he was borne, and also the purchase ofanother to take his place.  I am a competent witness, for I wasregimental quartermaster at the time.While at Corpus Christi all the officers who had a fancy for riding kepthorses.  The animals cost but little in the first instance, and whenpicketed they would get their living without any cost.  I had three notlong before the army moved, but a sad accident bereft me of them all atone time.  A colored boy who gave them all the attention they got--besides looking after my tent and that of a class-mate andfellow-lieutenant and cooking for us, all for about eight dollars permonth, was riding one to water and leading the other two.  The ledhorses pulled him from his seat and all three ran away.  They never wereheard of afterwards.  Shortly after that some one told Captain Bliss,General Taylor's Adjutant-General, of my misfortune.  'Yes; I heardGrant lost five or six dollars' worth of horses the other day,' hereplied.  That was a slander; they were broken to the saddle when I gotthem and cost nearly twenty dollars.  I never suspected the colored boyof malicious intent in letting them get away, because, if they had notescaped, he could have had one of them to ride on the long march then inprospect.
ISFP	 VI.ADVANCE OF THE ARMY--CROSSING THE COLORADO--THE RIO GRANDE.At last the preparations were complete and orders were issued for theadvance to begin on the 8th of March.  General Taylor had an army of notmore than three thousand men.  One battery, the siege guns and all theconvalescent troops were sent on by water to Brazos Santiago, at themouth of the Rio Grande.  A guard was left back at Corpus Christi tolook after public property and to take care of those who were too sickto be removed.  The remainder of the army, probably not more than twentyfive hundred men, was divided into three brigades, with the cavalryindependent.  Colonel Twiggs, with seven companies of dragoons and abattery of light artillery, moved on the 8th.  He was followed by thethree infantry brigades, with a day's interval between the commands.Thus the rear brigade did not move from Corpus Christi until the 11th ofMarch.  In view of the immense bodies of men moved on the same day overnarrow roads, through dense forests and across large streams, in ourlate war, it seems strange now that a body of less than three thousandmen should have been broken into four columns, separated by a day'smarch.General Taylor was opposed to anything like plundering by the troops,and in this instance, I doubt not, he looked upon the enemy as theaggrieved party and was not willing to injure them further than hisinstructions from Washington demanded.  His orders to the troopsenjoined scrupulous regard for the rights of all peaceable persons andthe payment of the highest price for all supplies taken for the use ofthe army.All officers of foot regiments who had horses were permitted to ridethem on the march when it did not interfere with their military duties.As already related, having lost my 'five or six dollars' worth ofhorses' but a short time before I determined not to get another, but tomake the journey on foot.  My company commander, Captain McCall, had twogood American horses, of considerably more value in that country, wherenative horses were cheap, than they were in the States. He used onehimself and wanted the other for his servant.  He was quite anxious toknow whether I did not intend to get me another horse before the marchbegan.  I told him No; I belonged to a foot regiment.  I did notunderstand the object of his solicitude at the time, but, when we wereabout to start, he said:  'There, Grant, is a horse for you.'  I foundthat he could not bear the idea of his servant riding on a long marchwhile his lieutenant went a-foot.  He had found a mustang, a three-yearold colt only recently captured, which had been purchased by one of thecolored servants with the regiment for the sum of three dollars.  It wasprobably the only horse at Corpus Christi that could have been purchasedjust then for any reasonable price.  Five dollars, sixty-six andtwo-thirds per cent. advance, induced the owner to part with themustang.  I was sorry to take him, because I really felt that, belongingto a foot regiment, it was my duty to march with the men.  But I saw theCaptain's earnestness in the matter, and accepted the horse for thetrip.  The day we started was the first time the horse had ever beenunder saddle. I had, however, but little difficulty in breaking him,though for the first day there were frequent disagreements between us asto which way we should go, and sometimes whether we should go at all.At no time during the day could I choose exactly the part of the columnI would march with; but after that, I had as tractable a horse as anywith the army, and there was none that stood the trip better. He neverate a mouthful of food on the journey except the grass he could pickwithin the length of his picket rope.A few days out from Corpus Christi, the immense herd of wild horses thatranged at that time between the Nueces and the Rio Grande was seendirectly in advance of the head of the column and but a few miles off.It was the very band from which the horse I was riding had been capturedbut a few weeks before. The column was halted for a rest, and a numberof officers, myself among them, rode out two or three miles to the rightto see the extent of the herd.  The country was a rolling prairie, and,from the higher ground, the vision was obstructed only by the earth'scurvature.  As far as the eye could reach to our right, the herdextended.  To the left, it extended equally. There was no estimating thenumber of animals in it; I have no idea that they could all have beencorralled in the State of Rhode Island, or Delaware, at one time.  Ifthey had been, they would have been so thick that the pasturage wouldhave given out the first day. People who saw the Southern herd ofbuffalo, fifteen or twenty years ago, can appreciate the  size of theTexas band of wild horses in 1846.At the point where the army struck the Little Colorado River, the streamwas quite wide and of sufficient depth for navigation. The water wasbrackish and the banks were fringed with timber. Here the whole armyconcentrated before attempting to cross. The army was not accompanied bya pontoon train, and at that time the troops were not instructed inbridge building.  To add to the embarrassment of the situation, the armywas here, for the first time, threatened with opposition. Buglers,concealed from our view by the brush on the opposite side, sounded the'assembly,' and other military calls.  Like the wolves before spoken of,they gave the impression that there was a large number of them and that,if the troops were in proportion to the noise, they were sufficient todevour General Taylor and his army.  There were probably but few troops,and those engaged principally in watching the movements of the'invader.'  A few of our cavalry dashed in, and forded and swam thestream, and all opposition was soon dispersed.  I do not remember that asingle shot was fired.The troops waded the stream, which was up to their necks in the deepESTJart.  Teams were crossed by attaching a long rope to the end of thewagon tongue passing it between the two swing mules and by the side ofthe leader, hitching his bridle as well as the bridle of the mules inrear to it, and carrying the end to men on the opposite shore.  The bankdown to the water was steep on both sides.  A rope long enough to crossthe river, therefore, was attached to the back axle of the wagon, andmen behind would hold the rope to prevent the wagon 'beating' the mulesinto the water.  This latter rope also served the purpose of bringingthe end of the forward one back, to be used over again.  The water wasdeep enough for a short distance to swim the little Mexican mules whichthe army was then using, but they, and the wagons, were pulled throughso fast by the men at the end of the rope ahead, that no time was leftthem to show their obstinacy.  In this manner the artillery andtransportation of the 'army of occupation' crossed the Colorado River.About the middle of the month of March the advance of the army reachedthe Rio Grande and went into camp near the banks of the river, oppositethe city of Matamoras and almost under the guns of a small fort at thelower end of the town.  There was not at that time a single habitationfrom Corpus Christi until the Rio Grande was reached.The work of fortifying was commenced at once.  The fort was laid out bythe engineers, but the work was done by the soldiers under thesupervision of their officers, the chief engineer retaining generaldirections.  The Mexicans now became so incensed at our near approachthat some of their troops crossed the river above us, and made it unsafefor small bodies of men to go far beyond the limits of camp.  Theycaptured two companies of dragoons, commanded by Captains Thornton andHardee.  The latter figured as a general in the late war, on theConfederate side, and was author of the tactics first used by botharmies.  Lieutenant Theodric Porter, of the 4th infantry, was killedwhile out with a small detachment; and Major Cross, the assistantquartermaster-general, had also been killed not far from camp.There was no base of supplies nearer than Point Isabel, on the coast,north of the mouth of the Rio Grande and twenty-five miles away.  Theenemy, if the Mexicans could be called such at this time when no war hadbeen declared, hovered about in such numbers that it was not safe tosend a wagon train after supplies with any escort that could be spared.I have already said that General Taylor's whole command on the RioGrande numbered less than three thousand men.  He had, however, a fewmore troops at Point Isabel or Brazos Santiago.  The supplies broughtfrom Corpus Christi in wagons were running short.  Work was thereforepushed with great vigor on the defences, to enable the minimum number oftroops to hold the fort.  All the men who could be employed, were keptat work from early dawn until darkness closed the labors of the day.With all this the fort was not completed until the supplies grew soshort that further delay in obtaining more could not be thought of.  Bythe latter part of April the work was in a partially defensiblecondition, and the 7th infantry, Major Jacob Brown commanding, wasmarched in to garrison it, with some few pieces of artillery.  All thesupplies on hand, with the exception of enough to carry the rest of thearmy to Point Isabel, were left with the garrison, and the march wascommenced with the remainder of the command, every wagon being takenwith the army.  Early on the second day after starting the force reachedits destination, without opposition from the Mexicans.  There was somedelay in getting supplies ashore from vessels at anchor in the openroadstead.
ISFP	 VII.THE MEXICAN WAR--THE BATTLE OF PALO ALTO--THE BATTLE OF RESACA DE LAPALMA--ARMY OF INVASION--GENERAL TAYLOR--MOVEMENT ON CAMARGO.While General Taylor was away with the bulk of his army, the littlegarrison up the river was besieged.  As we lay in our tents upon thesea-shore, the artillery at the fort on the Rio Grande could bedistinctly heard.The war had begun.There were no possible means of obtaining news from the garrison, andinformation from outside could not be otherwise than unfavorable.  WhatGeneral Taylor's feelings were during this suspense I do not know; butfor myself, a young second-lieutenant who had never heard a hostile gunbefore, I felt sorry that I had enlisted.  A great many men, when theysmell battle afar off, chafe to get into the fray.  When they say sothemselves they generally fail to convince their hearers that they areas anxious as they would like to make believe, and as they approachdanger they become more subdued.  This rule is not universal, for I haveknown a few men who were always aching for a fight when there was noenemy near, who were as good as their word when the battle did come.But the number of such men is small.On the 7th of May the wagons were all loaded and General Taylor startedon his return, with his army reinforced at Point Isabel, but still lessthan three thousand strong, to relieve the garrison on the Rio Grande.The road from Point Isabel to Matamoras is over an open, rolling,treeless prairie, until the timber that borders the bank of the RioGrande is reached.  This river, like the Mississippi, flows through arich alluvial valley in the most meandering manner, running towards allpoints of the compass at times within a few miles.  Formerly the riverran by Resaca de la Palma, some four or five miles east of the presentchannel.  The old bed of the river at Resaca had become filled atplaces, leaving a succession of little lakes.  The timber that hadformerly grown upon both banks, and for a considerable distance out, wasstill standing.  This timber was struck six or eight miles out from thebesieged garrison, at a point known as Palo Alto--'Tall trees' or'woods.'Early in the forenoon of the 8th of May as Palo Alto was approached, anarmy, certainly outnumbering our little force, was seen, drawn up inline of battle just in front of the timber.  Their bayonets andspearheads glistened in the sunlight formidably.  The force was composedlargely of cavalry armed with lances.  Where we were the grass was tall,reaching nearly to the shoulders of the men, very stiff, and each stockwas pointed at the top, and hard and almost as sharp as adarning-needle. General Taylor halted his army before the head of columncame in range of the artillery of the Mexicans.  He then formed a lineof battle, facing the enemy.  His artillery, two batteries and twoeighteen-pounder iron guns, drawn by oxen, were placed in position atintervals along the line.  A battalion was thrown to the rear, commandedby Lieutenant-Colonel Childs, of the artillery, as reserves.  Thesepreparations completed, orders were given for a platoon of each companyto stack arms and go to a stream off to the right of the command, tofill their canteens and also those of the rest of their respectivecompanies.  When the men were all back in their places in line, thecommand to advance was given.  As I looked down that long line of aboutthree thousand armed men, advancing towards a larger force also armed,I thought what a fearful responsibility General Taylor must feel,commanding such a host and so far away from friends.  The Mexicansimmediately opened fire upon us, first with artillery and then withinfantry.  At first their shots did not reach us, and the advance wascontinued.  As we got nearer, the cannon balls commenced going throughthe ranks.  They hurt no one, however, during this advance, because theywould strike the ground long before they reached our line, andricochetted through the tall grass so slowly that the men would see themand open ranks and let them pass.  When we got to a point where theartillery could be used with effect, a halt was called, and the battleopened on both sides.The infantry under General Taylor was armed with flint-lock muskets, andpaper cartridges charged with powder, buck-shot and ball.  At thedistance of a few hundred yards a man might fire at you all day withoutyour finding it out.  The artillery was generally six-pounder brass gunsthrowing only solid shot; but General Taylor had with him three or fourtwelve-pounder howitzers throwing shell, besides his eighteen-poundersbefore spoken of, that had a long range.  This made a powerful armament.The Mexicans were armed about as we were so far as their infantry wasconcerned, but their artillery only fired solid shot.  We had greatlythe advantage in this arm.The artillery was advanced a rod or two in front of the line, and openedfire.  The infantry stood at order arms as spectators, watching theeffect of our shots upon the enemy, and watching his shots so as to stepout of their way.  It could be seen that the eighteen-pounders and thehowitzers did a great deal of execution.  On our side there was littleor no loss while we occupied this position.  During the battle MajorRinggold, an accomplished and brave artillery officer, was mortallywounded, and Lieutenant Luther, also of the artillery, was struck.During the day several advances were made, and just at dusk it becameevident that the Mexicans were falling back. We again advanced, andoccupied at the close of the battle substantially the ground held by theenemy at the beginning.  In this last move there was a brisk fire uponour troops, and some execution was done.  One cannon-ball passed throughour ranks, not far from me.  It took off the head of an enlisted man,and the under jaw of Captain Page of my regiment, while the splintersfrom the musket of the killed soldier, and his brains and bones, knockeddown two or three others, including one officer, Lieutenant Wallen,--hurting them more or less.  Our casualties for the day were nine killedand forty-seven wounded.At the break of day on the 9th, the army under Taylor was ready to renewthe battle; but an advance showed that the enemy had entirely left ourfront during the night.  The chaparral before us was impenetrable exceptwhere there were roads or trails, with occasionally clear or bare spotsof small dimensions.  A body of men penetrating it might easily beambushed.  It was better to have a few men caught in this way than thewhole army, yet it was necessary that the garrison at the river shouldbe relieved.  To get to them the chaparral had to be passed.  Thus Iassume General Taylor reasoned.  He halted the army not far in advanceof the ground occupied by the Mexicans the day before, and selectedCaptain C. F. Smith, of the artillery, and Captain McCall, of mycompany, to take one hundred and fifty picked men each and find wherethe enemy had gone.  This left me in command of the company, an honorand responsibility I thought very great.Smith and McCall found no obstruction in the way of their advance untilthey came up to the succession of ponds, before describes, at Resaca.The Mexicans had passed them and formed their lines on the oppositebank.  This position they had strengthened a little by throwing up deadtrees and brush in their front, and by placing artillery to cover theapproaches and open places.  Smith and McCall deployed on each side ofthe road as well as they could, and engaged the enemy at long range.Word was sent back, and the advance of the whole army was at oncecommenced.  As we came up we were deployed in like manner.  I was withthe right wing, and led my company through the thicket wherever apenetrable place could be found, taking advantage of any clear spot thatwould carry me towards the enemy.  At last I got pretty close up withoutknowing it.  The balls commenced to whistle very thick overhead, cuttingthe limbs of the chaparral right and left.  We could not see the enemy,so I ordered my men to lie down, an order that did not have to beenforced.  We kept our position until it became evident that the enemywere not firing at us, and then withdrew to find better ground toadvance upon.By this time some progress had been made on our left.  A section ofartillery had been captured by the cavalry, and some prisoners had beentaken.  The Mexicans were giving way all along the line, and many ofthem had, no doubt, left early.  I at last found a clear spaceseparating two ponds.  There seemed to be a few men in front and Icharged upon them with my company.There was no resistance, and we captured a Mexican colonel, who had beenwounded, and a few men.  Just as I was sending them to the rear with aguard of two or three men, a private came from the front bringing backone of our officers, who had been badly wounded in advance of where Iwas.  The ground had been charged over before.  My exploit was equal tothat of the soldier who boasted that he had cut off the leg of one ofthe enemy.  When asked why he did not cut off his head, he replied:'Some one had done that before.'  This left no doubt in my mind but thatthe battle of Resaca de la Palma would have been won, just as it was, ifI had not been there.  There was no further resistance. The evening ofthe 9th the army was encamped on its old ground near the Fort, and thegarrison was relieved.  The siege had lasted a number of days, but thecasualties were few in number.  Major Jacob Brown, of the 7th infantry,the commanding officer, had been killed, and in his honor the fort wasnamed. Since then a town of considerable importance has sprung up on theground occupied by the fort and troops, which has also taken his name.The battles of Palo Alto and Resaca de la Palma seemed to us engaged, aspretty important affairs; but we had only a faint conception of theirmagnitude until they were fought over in the North by the Press and thereports came back to us.  At the same time, or about the same time, welearned that war existed between the United States and Mexico, by theacts of the latter country.  On learning this fact General Taylortransferred our camps to the south or west bank of the river, andMatamoras was occupied.  We then became the 'Army of Invasion.'Up to this time Taylor had none but regular troops in his command; butnow that invasion had already taken place, volunteers for one yearcommenced arriving.  The army remained at Matamoras until sufficientlyreinforced to warrant a movement into the interior.  General Taylor wasnot an officer to trouble the administration much with his demands, butwas inclined to do the best he could with the means given him.  He felthis responsibility as going no further.  If he had thought that he wassent to perform an impossibility with the means given him, he wouldprobably have informed the authorities of his opinion and left them todetermine what should be done.  If the judgment was against him he wouldhave gone on and done the best he could with the means at hand withoutparading his grievance before the public.  No soldier could face eitherdanger or responsibility more calmly than he.  These are qualities morerarely found than genius or physical courage.General Taylor never made any great show or parade, either of uniform orretinue.  In dress he was possibly too plain, rarely wearing anything inthe field to indicate his rank, or even that he was an officer; but hewas known to every soldier in his army, and was respected by all.  I cancall to mind only one instance when I saw him in uniform, and one otherwhen I heard of his wearing it, On both occasions he was unfortunate.The first was at Corpus Christi.  He had concluded to review his armybefore starting on the march and gave orders accordingly.  ColonelTwiggs was then second in rank with the army, and to him was given thecommand of the review.  Colonel and Brevet Brigadier-General Worth, afar different soldier from Taylor in the use of the uniform, was next toTwiggs in rank, and claimed superiority by virtue of his brevet rankwhen the accidents of service threw them where one or the other had tocommand.  Worth declined to attend the review as subordinate to Twiggsuntil the question was settled by the highest authority.  This broke upthe review, and the question was referred to Washington for finaldecision.General Taylor was himself only a colonel, in real rank, at that time,and a brigadier-general by brevet.  He was assigned to duty, however, bythe President, with the rank which his brevet gave him.  Worth was notso assigned, but by virtue of commanding a division he must, under thearmy regulations of that day, have drawn the pay of his brevet rank.The question was submitted to Washington, and no response was receiveduntil after the army had reached the Rio Grande.  It was decided againstGeneral Worth, who at once tendered his resignation and left the army,going north, no doubt, by the same vessel that carried it.  This kepthim out of the battles of Palo Alto and Resaca de la Palma.  Either theresignation was not accepted, or General Worth withdrew it before actionhad been taken.  At all events he returned to the army in time tocommand his division in the battle of Monterey, and served with it tothe end of the war.The second occasion on which General Taylor was said to have donned hisuniform, was in order to receive a visit from the Flag Officer of thenaval squadron off the mouth of the Rio Grande.  While the army was onthat river the Flag Officer sent word that he would call on the Generalto pay his respects on a certain day.  General Taylor, knowing thatnaval officers habitually wore all the uniform the 'law allowed' on alloccasions of ceremony, thought it would be only civil to receive hisguest in the same style.  His uniform was therefore got out, brushed up,and put on, in advance of the visit.  The Flag Officer, knowing GeneralTaylor's aversion to the wearing of the uniform, and feeling that itwould be regarded as a compliment should he meet him in civilian'sdress, left off his uniform for this occasion.  The meeting was said tohave been embarrassing to both, and the conversation was principallyapologetic.The time was whiled away pleasantly enough at Matamoras, while we werewaiting for volunteers.  It is probable that all the most importantpeople of the territory occupied by our army left their homes before wegot there, but with those remaining the best of relations apparentlyexisted.  It was the policy of the Commanding General to allow nopillaging, no taking of private property for public or individual usewithout satisfactory compensation, so that a better market was affordedthan the people had ever known before.Among the troops that joined us at Matamoras was an Ohio regiment, ofwhich Thomas L. Hamer, the Member of Congress who had given me myappointment to West Point, was major.  He told me then that he couldhave had the colonelcy, but that as he knew he was to be appointed abrigadier-general, he preferred at first to take the lower grade.  Ihave said before that Hamer was one of the ablest men Ohio everproduced.  At that time he was in the prime of life, being less thanfifty years of age, and possessed an admirable physique, promising longlife.  But he was taken sick before Monterey, and died within a fewdays.  I have always believed that had his life been spared, he wouldhave been President of the United States during the term filled byPresident Pierce.  Had Hamer filled that office his partiality for mewas such, there is but little doubt I should have been appointed to oneof the staff corps of the army--the Pay Department probably--and wouldtherefore now be preparing to retire.  Neither of these speculations isunreasonable, and they are mentioned to show how little men controltheir own destiny.Reinforcements having arrived, in the month of August the movementcommenced from Matamoras to Camargo, the head of navigation on the RioGrande.  The line of the Rio Grande was all that was necessary to hold,unless it was intended to invade Mexico from the North.  In that casethe most natural route to take was the one which General Taylorselected.  It entered a pass in the Sierra Madre Mountains, at Monterey,through which the main road runs to the City of Mexico.  Monterey itselfwas a good point to hold, even if the line of the Rio Grande covered allthe territory we desired to occupy at that time.  It is built on a plaintwo thousand feet above tide water, where the air is bracing and thesituation healthy.On the 19th of August the army started for Monterey, leaving a smallgarrison at Matamoras.  The troops, with the exception of the artillery,cavalry, and the brigade to which I belonged, were moved up the river toCamargo on steamers.  As there were but two or three of these, the boatshad to make a number of trips before the last of the troops wereup. Those who marched did so by the south side of the river.Lieutenant-Colonel Garland, of the 4th infantry, was the brigadecommander, and on this occasion commanded the entire marching force.One day out convinced him that marching by day in that latitude, in themonth of August, was not a beneficial sanitary measure, particularly forNorthern men.  The order of marching was changed and night marches weresubstituted with the best results.When Camargo was reached, we found a city of tents outside the Mexicanhamlet.  I was detailed to act as quartermaster and commissary to theregiment.  The teams that had proven abundantly sufficient to transportall supplies from Corpus Christi to the Rio Grande over the levelprairies of Texas, were entirely inadequate to the needs of thereinforced army in a mountainous country.  To obviate the deficiency,pack mules were hired, with Mexicans to pack and drive them.  I hadcharge of the few wagons allotted to the 4th infantry and of the packtrain to supplement them.  There were not men enough in the army tomanage that train without the help of Mexicans who had learned how.  Asit was the difficulty was great enough.  The troops would take up theirmarch at an early hour each day.  After they had started, the tents andcooking utensils had to be made into packages, so that they could belashed to the backs of the mules.  Sheet-iron kettles, tent-poles andmess chests were inconvenient articles to transport in that way.  Ittook several hours to get ready to start each morning, and by the timewe were ready some of the mules first loaded would be tired of standingso long with their loads on their backs. Sometimes one would start torun, bowing his back and kicking up until he scattered his load; otherswould lie down and try to disarrange their loads by attempting to get onthe top of them by rolling on them; others with tent-poles for part oftheir loads would manage to run a tent-pole on one side of a saplingwhile they would take the other.  I am not aware of ever having used aprofane expletive in my life; but I would have the charity to excusethose who may have done so, if they were in charge of a train of Mexicanpack mules at the time.
ISFP	 VIII.ADVANCE ON MONTEREY--THE BLACK FORT--THE BATTLE OF MONTEREY--SURRENDEROF THE CITY.The advance from Camargo was commenced on the 5th of September. The armywas divided into four columns, separated from each other by one day'smarch.  The advance reached Cerralvo in four days and halted for theremainder of the troops to come up.  By the 13th the rear-guard hadarrived, and the same day the advance resumed its march, followed asbefore, a day separating the divisions.  The forward division haltedagain at Marin, twenty-four miles from Monterey.  Both this place andCerralvo were nearly deserted, and men, women and children were seenrunning and scattered over the hills as we approached; but when thepeople returned they found all their abandoned property safe, which musthave given them a favorable opinion of Los Grengos--'the Yankees.'  FromMarin the movement was in mass. On the 19th General Taylor, with isarmy, was encamped at Walnut Springs, within three miles of Monterey.The town is on a small stream coming out of the mountain-pass, and isbacked by a range of hills of moderate elevation.  To the north, betweenthe city and Walnut Springs, stretches an extensive plain.  On thisplain, and entirely outside of the last houses of the city, stood astrong fort, enclosed on all sides, to which our army gave the name of'Black Fort.'  Its guns commanded the approaches to the city to the fullextent of their range.  There were two detached spurs of hills ormountains to the north and northwest of the city, which were alsofortified.  On one of these stood the Bishop's Palace.  The road toSaltillo leaves the upper or western end of the city under the fire ofthe guns from these heights.  The lower or eastern end was defended bytwo or three small detached works, armed with artillery and infantry.To the south was the mountain stream before mentioned, and back of thatthe range of foot-hills.  The plaza in the centre of the city was thecitadel, properly speaking.  All the streets leading from it were sweptby artillery, cannon being intrenched behind temporary parapets. Thehouse-tops near the plaza were converted into infantry fortifications bythe use of sand-bags for parapets.  Such were the defences of Montereyin September, 1847.  General Ampudia, with a force of certainly tenthousand men, was in command.General Taylor's force was about six thousand five hundred strong, inthree divisions, under Generals Butler, Twiggs and Worth.  The troopswent into camp at Walnut Springs, while the engineer officers, underMajor Mansfield--a General in the late war--commenced theirreconnoissance.  Major Mansfield found that it would be practicable toget troops around, out of range of the Black Fort and the works on thedetached hills to the north-west of the city, to the Saltillo road.With this road in our possession, the enemy would be cut off fromreceiving further supplies, if not from all communication with theinterior. General Worth, with his division somewhat reinforced, wasgiven the task of gaining possession of the Saltillo road, and ofcarrying the detached works outside the city, in that quarter. Hestarted on his march early in the afternoon of the 20th.  The divisionsunder Generals Butler and Twiggs were drawn up to threaten the east andnorth sides of the city and the works on those fronts, in support of themovement under General Worth. Worth's was regarded as the main attack onMonterey, and all other operations were in support of it.  His marchthis day was uninterrupted; but the enemy was seen to reinforce heavilyabout the Bishop's Palace and the other outside fortifications on theirleft.  General Worth reached a defensible position just out of range ofthe enemy's guns on the heights north-west of the city, and bivouackedfor the night.  The engineer officers with him--Captain Sanders andLieutenant George G. Meade, afterwards the commander of the victoriousNational army at the battle of Gettysburg--made a reconnoissance to theSaltillo road under cover of night.During the night of the 20th General Taylor had established a battery,consisting of two twenty-four-pounder howitzers and a ten inch mortar,at a point from which they could play upon Black Fort.  A naturaldepression in the plain, sufficiently deep to protect men standing in itfrom the fire from the fort, was selected and the battery established onthe crest nearest the enemy.  The 4th infantry, then consisting of butsix reduced companies, was ordered to support the artillerists whilethey were intrenching themselves and their guns.  I was regimentalquartermaster at the time and was ordered to remain in charge of campand the public property at Walnut Springs.  It was supposed that theregiment would return to its camp in the morning.The point for establishing the siege battery was reached and the workperformed without attracting the attention of the enemy.  At daylightthe next morning fire was opened on both sides and continued with, whatseemed to me at that day, great fury.  My curiosity got the better of myjudgment, and I mounted a horse and rode to the front to see what wasgoing on.  I had been there but a short time when an order to charge wasgiven, and lacking the moral courage to return to camp--where I had beenordered to stay--I charged with the regiment As soon as the troops wereout of the depression they came under the fire of Black Fort.  As theyadvanced they got under fire from batteries guarding the east, or lower,end of the city, and of musketry. About one-third of the men engaged inthe charge were killed or wounded in the space of a few minutes.  Weretreated to get out of fire, not backward, but eastward andperpendicular to the direct road running into the city from WalnutSprings.  I was, I believe, the only person in the 4th infantry in thecharge who was on horseback.  When we got to a lace of safety theregiment halted and drew itself together--what was left of it.  Theadjutant of the regiment, Lieutenant Hoskins, who was not in robusthealth, found himself very much fatigued from running on foot in thecharge and retreat, and, seeing me on horseback, expressed a wish thathe could be mounted also.  I offered him my horse and he accepted theoffer.  A few minutes later I saw a soldier, a quartermaster's man,mounted, not far away.  I ran to him, took his horse and was back withthe regiment in a few minutes.  In a short time we were off again; andthe next place of safety from the shots of the enemy that I recollect ofbeing in, was a field of cane or corn to the north-east of the lowerbatteries.  The adjutant to whom I had loaned my horse was killed, and Iwas designated to act in his place.This charge was ill-conceived, or badly executed.  We belonged to thebrigade commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel Garland, and he had receivedorders to charge the lower batteries of the city, and carry them if hecould without too much loss, for the purpose of creating a diversion infavor of Worth, who was conducting the movement which it was intendedshould be decisive.  By a movement by the left flank Garland could haveled his men beyond the range of the fire from Black Fort and advancedtowards the northeast angle of the city, as well covered from fire ascould be expected.  There was no undue loss of life in reaching thelower end of Monterey, except that sustained by Garland's command.Meanwhile Quitman's brigade, conducted by an officer of engineers, hadreached the eastern end of the city, and was placed under cover of thehouses without much loss.  Colonel Garland's brigade also arrived at thesuburbs, and, by the assistance of some of our troops that had reachedhouse-tops from which they could fire into a little battery covering theapproaches to the lower end of the city, the battery was speedilycaptured and its guns were turned upon another work of the enemy.  Anentrance into the east end of the city was now secured, and the housesprotected our troops so long as they were inactive.  On the west GeneralWorth had reached the Saltillo road after some fighting but withoutheavy loss.  He turned from his new position and captured the forts onboth heights in that quarter.  This gave him possession of the upper orwest end of Monterey.  Troops from both Twiggs's and Butler's divisionswere in possession of the east end of the town, but the Black Fort tothe north of the town and the plaza in the centre were still in thepossession of the enemy.  Our camps at Walnut Springs, three miles away,were guarded by a company from each regiment.  A regiment of Kentuckyvolunteers guarded the mortars and howitzers engaged against Black Fort.Practically Monterey was invested.There was nothing done on the 22d by the United States troops; but theenemy kept up a harmless fire upon us from Black Fort and the batteriesstill in their possession at the east end of the city.  During the nightthey evacuated these; so that on the morning of the 23d we heldundisputed possession of the east end of Monterey.Twiggs's division was at the lower end of the city, and well coveredfrom the fire of the enemy.  But the streets leading to the plaza--allSpanish or Spanish-American towns have near their centres a squarecalled a plaza--were commanded from all directions by artillery.  Thehouses were flat-roofed and but one or two stories high, and about theplaza the roofs were manned with infantry, the troops being protectedfrom our fire by parapets made of sand-bags.  All advances into the citywere thus attended with much danger.  While moving along streets whichdid not lead to the plaza, our men were protected from the fire, andfrom the view, of the enemy except at the crossings; but at these avolley of musketry and a discharge of grape-shot were invariablyencountered.  The 3d and 4th regiments of infantry made an advancenearly to the plaza in this way and with heavy loss.  The loss of the 3dinfantry in commissioned officers was especially severe.  There wereonly five companies of the regiment and not over twelve officerspresent, and five of these officers were killed.  When within a squareof the plaza this small command, ten companies in all, was brought to ahalt.  Placing themselves under cover from the shots of the enemy, themen would watch to detect a head above the sand-bags on the neighboringhouses.  The exposure of a single head would bring a volley from oursoldiers.We had not occupied this position long when it was discovered that ourammunition was growing low.  I volunteered to go back (*2) to the pointwe had started from, report our position to General Twiggs, and ask forammunition to be forwarded.  We were at this time occupying ground offfrom the street, in rear of the houses.  My ride back was an exposedone.  Before starting I adjusted myself on the side of my horse furthestfrom the enemy, and with only one foot holding to the cantle of thesaddle, and an arm over the neck of the horse exposed, I started at fullrun.  It was only at street crossings that my horse was under fire, butthese I crossed at such a flying rate that generally I was past andunder cover of the next block of houses before the enemy fired.  I gotout safely without a scratch.At one place on my ride, I saw a sentry walking in front of a house, andstopped to inquire what he was doing there.  Finding that the house wasfull of wounded American officers and soldiers, I dismounted and wentin.  I found there Captain Williams, of the Engineer Corps, wounded inthe head, probably fatally, and Lieutenant Territt, also badly woundedhis bowels protruding from his wound.  There were quite a number ofsoldiers also.  Promising them to report their situation, I left,readjusted myself to my horse, recommenced the run, and was soon withthe troops at the east end.  Before ammunition could be collected, thetwo regiments I had been with were seen returning, running the samegauntlet in getting out that they had passed in going in, but withcomparatively little loss.  The movement was countermanded and thetroops were withdrawn.  The poor wounded officers and men I had found,fell into the hands of the enemy during the night, and died.While this was going on at the east, General Worth, with a smalldivision of troops, was advancing towards the plaza from the oppositeend of the city.  He resorted to a better expedient for getting to theplaza--the citadel--than we did on the east. Instead of moving by theopen streets, he advanced through the houses, cutting passageways fromone to another.  Without much loss of life, he got so near the plazaduring the night that before morning, Ampudia, the Mexican commander,made overtures for the surrender of the city and garrison.  This stoppedall further hostilities.  The terms of surrender were soon agreed upon.The prisoners were paroled and permitted to take their horses andpersonal property with them.My pity was aroused by the sight of the Mexican garrison of Montereymarching out of town as prisoners, and no doubt the same feeling wasexperienced by most of our army who witnessed it.  Many of the prisonerswere cavalry, armed with lances, and mounted on miserable littlehalf-starved horses that did not look as if they could carry theirriders out of town.  The men looked in but little better condition.  Ithought how little interest the men before me had in the results of thewar, and how little knowledge they had of 'what it was all about.'After the surrender of the garrison of Monterey a quiet camp life wasled until midwinter.  As had been the case on the Rio Grande, the peoplewho remained at their homes fraternized with the 'Yankees' in thepleasantest manner.  In fact, under the humane policy of our commander,I question whether the great majority of the Mexican people did notregret our departure as much as they had regretted our coming.  Propertyand person were thoroughly protected, and a market was afforded for allthe products of the country such as the people had never enjoyed before.The educated and wealthy portion of the population here, as elsewhere,abandoned their homes and remained away from them as long as they werein the possession of the invaders; but this class formed a very smallpercentage of the whole population.
ISFP	 IX.POLITICAL INTRIGUE--BUENA VISTA--MOVEMENT AGAINST VERA CRUZ--SIEGE ANDCAPTURE OF VERA CRUZ.The Mexican war was a political war, and the administration conductingit desired to make party capital out of it.  General Scott was at thehead of the army, and, being a soldier of acknowledged professionalcapacity, his claim to the command of the forces in the field was almostindisputable and does not seem to have been denied by President Polk, orMarcy, his Secretary of War.  Scott was a Whig and the administrationwas democratic.  General Scott was also known to have politicalaspirations, and nothing so popularizes a candidate for high civilpositions as military victories.  It would not do therefore to give himcommand of the 'army of conquest.'  The plans submitted by Scott for acampaign in Mexico were disapproved by the administration, and hereplied, in a tone possibly a little disrespectful, to the effect that,if a soldier's plans were not to be supported by the administration,success could not be expected.  This was on the 27th of May, 1846.  Fourdays later General Scott was notified that he need not go to Mexico.General Gaines was next in rank, but he was too old and feeble to takethe field.  Colonel Zachary Taylor--a brigadier-general by brevet--wastherefore left in command.  He, too, was a Whig, but was not supposed toentertain any political ambitions; nor did he; but after the fall ofMonterey, his third battle and third complete victory, the Whig papersat home began to speak of him as the candidate of their party for thePresidency.  Something had to be done to neutralize his growingpopularity.  He could not be relieved from duty in the field where allhis battles had been victories:  the design would have been tootransparent.  It was finally decided to send General Scott to Mexico inchief command, and to authorize him to carry out his own original plan:that is, capture Vera Cruz and march upon the capital of the country.It was no doubt supposed that Scott's ambition would lead him toslaughter Taylor or destroy his chances for the Presidency, and yet itwas hoped that he would not make sufficient capital himself to securethe prize.The administration had indeed a most embarrassing problem to solve.  Itwas engaged in a war of conquest which must be carried to a successfulissue, or the political object would be unattained.  Yet all the capableofficers of the requisite rank belonged to the opposition, and the manselected for his lack of political ambition had himself become aprominent candidate for the Presidency.  It was necessary to destroy hischances promptly.  The problem was to do this without the loss ofconquest and without permitting another general of the same politicalparty to acquire like popularity.  The fact is, the administration ofMr. Polk made every preparation to disgrace Scott, or, to speak morecorrectly, to drive him to such desperation that he would disgracehimself.General Scott had opposed conquest by the way of the Rio Grande,Matamoras and Saltillo from the first.  Now that he was in command ofall the forces in Mexico, he withdrew from Taylor most of his regulartroops and left him only enough volunteers, as he thought, to hold theline then in possession of the invading army.  Indeed Scott did not deemit important to hold anything beyond the Rio Grande, and authorizedTaylor to fall back to that line if he chose.  General Taylor protestedagainst the depletion of his army, and his subsequent movement uponBuena Vista would indicate that he did not share the views of his chiefin regard to the unimportance of conquest beyond the Rio Grande.Scott had estimated the men and material that would be required tocapture Vera Cruz and to march on the capital of the country, twohundred and sixty miles in the interior.  He was promised all he askedand seemed to have not only the confidence of the President, but hissincere good wishes.  The promises were all broken.  Only about half thetroops were furnished that had been pledged, other war material waswithheld and Scott had scarcely started for Mexico before the Presidentundertook to supersede him by the appointment of Senator Thomas H.Benton as lieutenant-general.  This being refused by Congress, thePresident asked legislative authority to place a junior over a senior ofthe same grade, with the view of appointing Benton to the rank ofmajor-general and then placing him in command of the army, but Congressfailed to accede to this proposition as well, and Scott remained incommand: but every general appointed to serve under him was politicallyopposed to the chief, and several were personally hostile.General Scott reached Brazos Santiago or Point Isabel, at the mouth ofthe Rio Grande, late in December, 1846, and proceeded at once up theriver to Camargo, where he had written General Taylor to meet him.Taylor, however, had gone to, or towards Tampico, for the purpose ofestablishing a post there.  He had started on this march before he wasaware of General Scott being in the country.  Under these circumstancesScott had to issue his orders designating the troops to be withdrawnfrom Taylor, without the personal consultation he had expected to holdwith his subordinate.General Taylor's victory at Buena Vista, February 22d, 23d, and 24th,1847, with an army composed almost entirely of volunteers who had notbeen in battle before, and over a vastly superior force numerically,made his nomination for the Presidency by the Whigs a foregoneconclusion.  He was nominated and elected in 1848.  I believe that hesincerely regretted this turn in his fortunes, preferring the peaceafforded by a quiet life free from abuse to the honor of filling thehighest office in the gift of any people, the Presidency of the UnitedStates.When General Scott assumed command of the army of invasion, I was in thedivision of General David Twiggs, in Taylor's command; but under the neworders my regiment was transferred to the division of General WilliamWorth, in which I served to the close of the war.  The troops withdrawnfrom Taylor to form part of the forces to operate against Vera Cruz,were assembled at the mouth of the Rio Grande preparatory to embarkationfor their destination.  I found General Worth a different man from any Ihad before served directly under.  He was nervous, impatient andrestless on the march, or when important or responsible duty confrontedhim.  There was not the least reason for haste on the march, for it wasknown that it would take weeks to assemble shipping enough at the pointof our embarkation to carry the army, but General Worth moved hisdivision with a rapidity that would have been commendable had he beengoing to the relief of a beleaguered garrison.  The length of themarches was regulated by the distances between places affording a supplyof water for the troops, and these distances were sometimes long andsometimes short.  General Worth on one occasion at least, after havingmade the full distance intended for the day, and after the troops werein camp and preparing their food, ordered tents struck and made themarch that night which had been intended for the next day.  Somecommanders can move troops so as to get the maximum distance out of themwithout fatigue, while others can wear them out in a few days withoutaccomplishing so much. General Worth belonged to this latter class.  Heenjoyed, however, a fine reputation for his fighting qualities, and thusattached his officers and men to him.The army lay in camp upon the sand-beach in the neighborhood of themouth of the Rio Grande for several weeks, awaiting the arrival oftransports to carry it to its new field of operations.  The transportswere all sailing vessels.  The passage was a tedious one, and many ofthe troops were on shipboard over thirty days from the embarkation atthe mouth of the Rio Grande to the time of debarkation south of VeraCruz. The trip was a comfortless one for officers and men.  Thetransports used were built for carrying freight and possessed butlimited accommodations for passengers, and the climate added to thediscomfort of all.The transports with troops were assembled in the harbor of AntonLizardo, some sixteen miles south of Vera Cruz, as they arrived, andthere awaited the remainder of the fleet, bringing artillery, ammunitionand supplies of all kinds from the North.  With the fleet there was alittle steam propeller dispatch-boat--the first vessel of the kind I hadever seen, and probably the first of its kind ever seen by any one thenwith the army.  At that day ocean steamers were rare, and what therewere were sidewheelers.  This little vessel, going through the fleet sofast, so noiselessly and with its propeller under water out of view,attracted a great deal of attention.  I recollect that Lieutenant SidneySmith, of the 4th infantry, by whom I happened to be standing on thedeck of a vessel when this propeller was passing, exclaimed, 'Why, thething looks as if it was propelled by the force of circumstances.'Finally on the 7th of March, 1847, the little army of ten or twelvethousand men, given Scott to invade a country with a population of sevenor eight millions, a mountainous country affording the greatest possiblenatural advantages for defence, was all assembled and ready to commencethe perilous task of landing from vessels lying in the open sea.The debarkation took place inside of the little island of Sacrificios,some three miles south of Vera Cruz.  The vessels could not get anywherenear shore, so that everything had to be landed in lighters orsurf-boats; General Scott had provided these before leaving the North.The breakers were sometimes high, so that the landing was tedious.  Themen were got ashore rapidly, because they could wade when they came toshallow water; but the camp and garrison equipage, provisions,ammunition and all stores had to be protected from the salt water, andtherefore their landing took several days.  The Mexicans were very kindto us, however, and threw no obstacles in the way of our landing exceptan occasional shot from their nearest fort.  During the debarkation oneshot took off the head of Major Albertis.  No other, I believe, reachedanywhere near the same distance.  On the 9th of March the troops werelanded and the investment of Vera Cruz, from the Gulf of Mexico south ofthe city to the Gulf again on the north, was soon and easily effected.The landing of stores was continued until everything was got ashore.Vera Cruz, at the time of which I write and up to 1880, was a walledcity.  The wall extended from the water's edge south of the town to thewater again on the north.  There were fortifications at intervals alongthe line and at the angles. In front of the city, and on an island halfa mile out in the Gulf, stands San Juan de Ulloa, an enclosedfortification of large dimensions and great strength for that period.Against artillery of the present day the land forts and walls wouldprove elements of weakness rather than strength.  After the invadingarmy had established their camps out of range of the fire from the city,batteries were established, under cover of night, far to the front ofthe line where the troops lay.  These batteries were intrenched and theapproaches sufficiently protected.  If a sortie had been made at anytime by the Mexicans, the men serving the batteries could have beenquickly reinforced without great exposure to the fire from the enemy'smain line.  No serious attempt was made to capture the batteries or todrive our troops away.The siege continued with brisk firing on our side till the 27th ofMarch, by which time a considerable breach had been made in the wallsurrounding the city.  Upon this General Morales, who was Governor ofboth the city and of San Juan de Ulloa, commenced a correspondence withGeneral Scott looking to the surrender of the town, forts and garrison.On the 29th Vera Cruz and San Juan de Ulloa were occupied by Scott'sarmy.  About five thousand prisoners and four hundred pieces ofartillery, besides large amounts of small arms and ammunition, fell intothe hands of the victorious force.  The casualties on our side duringthe siege amounted to sixty-four officers and men, killed and wounded.
ISFP	 X.MARCH TO JALAPA--BATTLE OF CERRO GORDO--PEROTE--PUEBLA--SCOTT ANDTAYLOR.General Scott had less than twelve thousand men at Vera Cruz. He hadbeen promised by the administration a very much larger force, or claimedthat he had, and he was a man of veracity. Twelve thousand was a verysmall army with which to penetrate two hundred and sixty miles into anenemy's country, and to besiege the capital; a city, at that time, oflargely over one hundred thousand inhabitants.  Then, too, any line ofmarch that could be selected led through mountain passes easilydefended. In fact, there were at that time but two roads from Vera Cruzto the City of Mexico that could be taken by an army; one by Jalapa andPerote, the other by Cordova and Orizaba, the two coming together on thegreat plain which extends to the City of Mexico after the range ofmountains is passed.It was very important to get the army away from Vera Cruz as soon aspossible, in order to avoid the yellow fever, or vomito, which usuallyvisits that city early in the year, and is very fatal to persons notacclimated; but transportation, which was expected from the North, wasarriving very slowly.  It was absolutely necessary to have enough tosupply the army to Jalapa, sixty-five miles in the interior and abovethe fevers of the coast.  At that point the country is fertile, and anarmy of the size of General Scott's could subsist there for anindefinite period.  Not counting the sick, the weak and the garrisonsfor the captured city and fort, the moving column was now less than tenthousand strong.  This force was composed of three divisions, underGenerals Twiggs, Patterson, and Worth. The importance of escaping thevomito was so great that as soon as transportation enough could be gottogether to move a division the advance was commenced.  On the 8th ofApril, Twiggs's division started for Jalapa.  He was followed very soonby Patterson, with his division.  General Worth was to bring up the rearwith his command as soon as transportation enough was assembled to carrysix days' rations for his troops with the necessary ammunition and campand garrison equipage.  It was the 13th of April before this divisionleft Vera Cruz.The leading division ran against the enemy at Cerro Gordo, some fiftymiles west, on the road to Jalapa, and went into camp at Plan del Rio,about three miles from the fortifications. General Patterson reachedPlan del Rio with his division soon after Twiggs arrived.  The two werethen secure against an attack from Santa Anna, who commanded the Mexicanforces.  At all events they confronted the enemy without reinforcementsand without molestation, until the 18th of April.  General Scott hadremained at Vera Cruz to hasten preparations for the field; but on the12th, learning the situation at the front, he hastened on to takepersonal supervision.  He at once commenced his preparations for thecapture of the position held by Santa Anna and of the troops holding it.Cerro Gordo is one of the higher spurs of the mountains some twelve tofifteen miles east of Jalapa, and Santa Anna had selected this point asthe easiest to defend against an invading army.  The road, said to havebeen built by Cortez, zigzags around the mountain-side and was defendedat every turn by artillery.  On either side were deep chasms or mountainwalls. A direct attack along the road was an impossibility.  A flankmovement seemed equally impossible.  After the arrival of thecommanding-general upon the scene, reconnoissances were sent out tofind, or to make, a road by which the rear of the enemy's works might bereached without a front attack.  These reconnoissances were made underthe supervision of Captain Robert E. Lee, assisted by Lieutenants P. G.T. Beauregard, Isaac I. Stevens, Z. B. Tower, G. W. Smith, George B.McClellan, and J. G. Foster, of the corps of engineers, all officers whoattained rank and fame, on one side or the other, in the great conflictfor the preservation of the unity of the nation.  The reconnoissance wascompleted, and the labor of cutting out and making roads by the flank ofthe enemy was effected by the 17th of the month.  This was accomplishedwithout the knowledge of Santa Anna or his army, and over ground wherehe supposed it impossible.  On the same day General Scott issued hisorder for the attack on the 18th.The attack was made as ordered, and perhaps there was not a battle ofthe Mexican war, or of any other, where orders issued before anengagement were nearer being a correct report of what afterwards tookplace.  Under the supervision of the engineers, roadways had been openedover chasms to the right where the walls were so steep that men couldbarely climb them.  Animals could not.  These had been opened undercover of night, without attracting the notice of the enemy.  Theengineers, who had directed the opening, led the way and the troopsfollowed. Artillery was let down the steep slopes by hand, the menengaged attaching a strong rope to the rear axle and letting the gunsdown, a piece at a time, while the men at the ropes kept their ground ontop, paying out gradually, while a few at the front directed the courseof the piece.  In like manner the guns were drawn by hand up theopposite slopes.  In this way Scott's troops reached their assignedposition in rear of most of the intrenchments of the enemy, unobserved.The attack was made, the Mexican reserves behind the works beat a hastyretreat, and those occupying them surrendered.  On the left GeneralPillow's command made a formidable demonstration, which doubtless held apart of the enemy in his front and contributed to the victory. I am notpretending to give full details of all the battles fought, but of theportion that I saw.  There were troops engaged on both sides at otherpoints in which both sustained losses; but the battle was won as herenarrated.The surprise of the enemy was complete, the victory overwhelming; somethree thousand prisoners fell into Scott's hands, also a large amount ofordnance and ordnance stores.  The prisoners were paroled, the artilleryparked and the small arms and ammunition destroyed.  The battle of BuenaVista was probably very important to the success of General Scott atCerro Gordo and in his entire campaign from Vera Cruz to the greatplains reaching to the City of Mexico.  The only army Santa Anna had toprotect his capital and the mountain passes west of Vera Cruz, was theone he had with him confronting General Taylor. It is not likely that hewould have gone as far north as Monterey to attack the United Statestroops when he knew his country was threatened with invasion furthersouth.  When Taylor moved to Saltillo and then advanced on to BuenaVista, Santa Anna crossed the desert confronting the invading army,hoping no doubt to crush it and get back in time to meet General Scottin the mountain passes west of Vera Cruz.  His attack on Taylor wasdisastrous to the Mexican army, but, notwithstanding this, he marchedhis army to Cerro Gordo, a distance not much short of one thousand milesby the line he had to travel, in time to intrench himself well beforeScott got there.  If he had been successful at Buena Vista his troopswould no doubt have made a more stubborn resistance at Cerro Gordo.  Hadthe battle of Buena Vista not been fought Santa Anna would have had timeto move leisurely to meet the invader further south and with an army notdemoralized nor depleted by defeat.After the battle the victorious army moved on to Jalapa, where it was ina beautiful, productive and healthy country, far above the fevers of thecoast.  Jalapa, however, is still in the mountains, and between thereand the great plain the whole line of the road is easy of defence.  Itwas important, therefore, to get possession of the great highway betweenthe sea-coast and the capital up to the point where it leaves themountains, before the enemy could have time to re-organize and fortifyin our front. Worth's division was selected to go forward to secure thisresult.  The division marched to Perote on the great plain, not far fromwhere the road debouches from the mountains.  There is a low, strongfort on the plain in front of the town, known as the Castle of Perote.This, however, offered no resistance and fell into our hands, with itsarmament.General Scott having now only nine or ten thousand men west of VeraCruz, and the time of some four thousand of them being about to expire,a long delay was the consequence.  The troops were in a healthy climate,and where they could subsist for an indefinite period even if their lineback to Vera Cruz should be cut off.  It being ascertained that the menwhose time would expire before the City of Mexico could possibly fallinto the hands of the American army, would not remain beyond the termfor which they had volunteered, the commanding-general determined todischarge them at once, for a delay until the expiration of their timewould have compelled them to pass through Vera Cruz during the season ofthe vomito.  This reduced Scott's force in the field to about fivethousand men.Early in May, Worth, with his division, left Perote and marched on toPuebla.  The roads were wide and the country open except through onepass in a spur of mountains coming up from the south, through which theroad runs.  Notwithstanding this the small column was divided into twobodies, moving a day apart. Nothing occurred on the march of specialnote, except that while lying at the town of Amozoque--an easy day'smarch east of Puebla--a body of the enemy's cavalry, two or threethousand strong, was seen to our right, not more than a mile away.  Abattery or two, with two or three infantry regiments, was sent againstthem and they soon disappeared.  On the 15th of May we entered the cityof Puebla.General Worth was in command at Puebla until the latter end of May, whenGeneral Scott arrived.  Here, as well as on the march up, hisrestlessness, particularly under responsibilities, showed itself.During his brief command he had the enemy hovering around near the city,in vastly superior numbers to his own.  The brigade to which I wasattached changed quarters three different times in about a week,occupying at first quarters near the plaza, in the heart of the city;then at the western entrance; then at the extreme east.  On one occasionGeneral Worth had the troops in line, under arms, all day, with threedays' cooked rations in their haversacks.  He galloped from one commandto another proclaiming the near proximity of Santa Anna with an armyvastly superior to his own.  General Scott arrived upon the scene thelatter part of the month, and nothing more was heard of Santa Anna andhis myriads.  There were, of course, bodies of mounted Mexicans hoveringaround to watch our movements and to pick up stragglers, or small bodiesof troops, if they ventured too far out.  These always withdrew on theapproach of any considerable number of our soldiers.  After the arrivalof General Scott I was sent, as quartermaster, with a large train ofwagons, back two days' march at least, to procure forage.  We had lessthan a thousand men as escort, and never thought of danger.  We procuredfull loads for our entire train at two plantations, which could easilyhave furnished as much more.There had been great delay in obtaining the authority of Congress forthe raising of the troops asked for by the administration.  A bill wasbefore the National Legislature from early in the session of 1846-7,authorizing the creation of ten additional regiments for the war to beattached to the regular army, but it was the middle of February beforeit became a law.  Appointments of commissioned officers had then to bemade; men had to be enlisted, the regiments equipped and the wholetransported to Mexico.  It was August before General Scott receivedreinforcement sufficient to warrant an advance.  His moving column, noteven now more than ten thousand strong, was in four divisions, commandedby Generals Twiggs, Worth, Pillow and Quitman.  There was also a cavalrycorps under General Harney, composed of detachments of the 1st, 2d, and3d dragoons.  The advance commenced on the 7th of August with Twiggs'sdivision in front.  The remaining three divisions followed, with aninterval of a day between.  The marches were short, to makeconcentration easier in case of attack.I had now been in battle with the two leading commanders conductingarmies in a foreign land.  The contrast between the two was very marked.General Taylor never wore uniform, but dressed himself entirely forcomfort.  He moved about the field in which he was operating to seethrough his own eyes the situation.  Often he would be without staffofficers, and when he was accompanied by them there was no prescribedorder in which they followed.  He was very much given to sit his horseside-ways--with both feet on one side--particularly on the battlefield.General Scott was the reverse in all these particulars.  He always woreall the uniform prescribed or allowed by law when he inspected hislines; word would be sent to all division and brigade commanders inadvance, notifying them of the hour when the commanding general might beexpected.  This was done so that all the army might be under arms tosalute their chief as he passed.  On these occasions he wore his dressuniform, cocked hat, aiguillettes, sabre and spurs.  His staff proper,besides all officers constructively on his staff--engineers, inspectors,quartermasters, etc., that could be spared--followed, also in uniformand in prescribed order.  Orders were prepared with great care andevidently with the view that they should be a history of what followed.In their modes of expressing thought, these two generals contrastedquite as strongly as in their other characteristics.  General Scott wasprecise in language, cultivated a style peculiarly his own; was proud ofhis rhetoric; not averse to speaking of himself, often in the thirdperson, and he could bestow praise upon the person he was talking aboutwithout the least embarrassment.  Taylor was not a conversationalist,but on paper he could put his meaning so plainly that there could be nomistaking it.  He knew how to express what he wanted to say in thefewest well-chosen words, but would not sacrifice meaning to theconstruction of high-sounding sentences.  But with their oppositecharacteristics both were great and successful soldiers; both were true,patriotic and upright in all their dealings.  Both were pleasant toserve under--Taylor was pleasant to serve with.  Scott saw more throughthe eyes of his staff officers than through his own.  His plans weredeliberately prepared, and fully expressed in orders.  Taylor saw forhimself, and gave orders to meet the emergency without reference to howthey would read in history.
ISFP	 XI.ADVANCE ON THE CITY OF MEXICO--BATTLE OF CONTRERAS--ASSAULT ATCHURUBUSCO--NEGOTIATIONS FOR PEACE--BATTLE OF MOLINO DEL REY--STORMINGOF CHAPULTEPEC--SAN COSME--EVACUATION OF THE CITY--HALLS OF THEMONTEZUMAS.The route followed by the army from Puebla to the City of Mexico wasover Rio Frio mountain, the road leading over which, at the highESTJoint, is about eleven thousand feet above tide water. The pass throughthis mountain might have been easily defended, but it was not; and theadvanced division reached the summit in three days after leaving Puebla.The City of Mexico lies west of Rio Frio mountain, on a plain backed byanother mountain six miles farther west, with others still nearer on thenorth and south.  Between the western base of Rio Frio and the City ofMexico there are three lakes, Chalco and Xochimilco on the left andTexcoco on the right, extending to the east end of the City of Mexico.Chalco and Texcoco are divided by a narrow strip of land over which thedirect road to the city runs.  Xochimilco is also to the left of theroad, but at a considerable distance south of it, and is connected withLake Chalco by a narrow channel.  There is a high rocky mound, called ElPenon, on the right of the road, springing up from the low flat grounddividing the lakes.  This mound was strengthened by intrenchments at itsbase and summit, and rendered a direct attack impracticable.Scott's army was rapidly concentrated about Ayotla and other points nearthe eastern end of Lake Chalco.  Reconnoissances were made up to withingun-shot of El Penon, while engineers were seeking a route by the southside of Lake Chalco to flank the city, and come upon it from the southand south-west.  A way was found around the lake, and by the 18th ofAugust troops were in St. Augustin Tlalpam, a town about eleven milesdue south from the plaza of the capital.  Between St. Augustin Tlalpamand the city lie the hacienda of San Antonio and the village ofChurubusco, and south-west of them is Contreras.  All these points,except St. Augustin Tlalpam, were intrenched and strongly garrisoned.Contreras is situated on the side of a mountain, near its base, wherevolcanic rocks are piled in great confusion, reaching nearly to SanAntonio.  This made the approach to the city from the south verydifficult.The brigade to which I was attached--Garland's, of Worth's division--wassent to confront San Antonio, two or three miles from St. AugustinTlalpam, on the road to Churubusco and the City of Mexico.  The groundon which San Antonio stands is completely in the valley, and the surfaceof the land is only a little above the level of the lakes, and, exceptto the south-west, it was cut up by deep ditches filled with water.  Tothe south-west is the Pedregal--the volcanic rock before spoken of--overwhich cavalry or artillery could not be passed, and infantry would makebut poor progress if confronted by an enemy.  From the position occupiedby Garland's brigade, therefore, no movement could be made against thedefences of San Antonio except to the front, and by a narrow causeway,over perfectly level ground, every inch of which was commanded by theenemy's artillery and infantry.  If Contreras, some three miles west andsouth, should fall into our hands, troops from there could move to theright flank of all the positions held by the enemy between us and thecity.  Under these circumstances General Scott directed the holding ofthe front of the enemy without making an attack until further orders.On the 18th of August, the day of reaching San Augustin Tlalpam,Garland's brigade secured a position within easy range of the advancedintrenchments of San Antonio, but where his troops were protected by anartificial embankment that had been thrown up for some other purposethan defense.  General Scott at once set his engineers reconnoitring theworks about Contreras, and on the 19th movements were commenced to gettroops into positions from which an assault could be made upon the forceoccupying that place.  The Pedregal on the north and north-east, and themountain on the south, made the passage by either flank of the enemy'sdefences difficult, for their work stood exactly between those naturalbulwarks; but a road was completed during the day and night of the 19th,and troops were got to the north and west of the enemy.This affair, like that of Cerro Gordo, was an engagement in which theofficers of the engineer corps won special distinction.  In fact, inboth cases, tasks which seemed difficult at first sight were made easierfor the troops that had to execute them than they would have been on anordinary field.  The very strength of each of these positions was, bythe skill of the engineers, converted into a defence for the assaultingparties while securing their positions for final attack.  All the troopswith General Scott in the valley of Mexico, except a part of thedivision of General Quitman at San Augustin Tlalpam and the brigade ofGarland (Worth's division) at San Antonio, were engaged at the battle ofContreras, or were on their way, in obedience to the orders of theirchief, to reinforce those who were engaged.  The assault was made on themorning of the 20th, and in less than half an hour from the sound of theadvance the position was in our hands, with many prisoners and largequantities of ordnance and other stores. The brigade commanded byGeneral Riley was from its position the most conspicuous in the finalassault, but all did well, volunteers and regulars.From the point occupied by Garland's brigade we could see the progressmade at Contreras and the movement of troops toward the flank and rearof the enemy opposing us.  The Mexicans all the way back to the citycould see the same thing, and their conduct showed plainly that they didnot enjoy the sight.  We moved out at once, and found them gone from ourimmediate front.  Clarke's brigade of Worth's division now moved westover the point of the Pedregal, and after having passed to the northsufficiently to clear San Antonio, turned east and got on the causewayleading to Churubusco and the City of Mexico.  When he approachedChurubusco his left, under Colonel Hoffman, attacked a tete-de-pont atthat place and brought on an engagement.  About an hour after, Garlandwas ordered to advance directly along the causeway, and got up in timeto take part in the engagement.  San Antonio was found evacuated, theevacuation having probably taken place immediately upon the enemy seeingthe stars and stripes waving over Contreras.The troops that had been engaged at Contreras, and even then on theirway to that battle-field, were moved by a causeway west of, and parallelto the one by way of San Antonio and Churubusco.  It was expected by thecommanding general that these troops would move north sufficiently farto flank the enemy out of his position at Churubusco, before turningeast to reach the San Antonio road, but they did not succeed in this,and Churubusco proved to be about the severest battle fought in thevalley of Mexico.  General Scott coming upon the battle-field about thisjuncture, ordered two brigades, under Shields, to move north and turnthe right of the enemy.  This Shields did, but not without hard fightingand heavy loss.  The enemy finally gave way, leaving in our handsprisoners, artillery and small arms.  The balance of the causeway heldby the enemy, up to the very gates of the city, fell in like manner.  Irecollect at this place that some of the gunners who had stood theirground, were deserters from General Taylor's army on the Rio Grande.Both the strategy and tactics displayed by General Scott in thesevarious engagements of the 20th of August, 1847, were faultless as Ilook upon them now, after the lapse of so many years.  As before stated,the work of the engineer officers who made the reconnoissances and ledthe different commands to their destinations, was so perfect that thechief was able to give his orders to his various subordinates with allthe precision he could use on an ordinary march.  I mean, up to thepoints from which the attack was to commence.  After that point isreached the enemy often induces a change of orders not beforecontemplated.  The enemy outside the city outnumbered our soldiery quitethree to one, but they had become so demoralized by the succession ofdefeats this day, that the City of Mexico could have been enteredwithout much further bloodshed.  In fact, Captain Philip Kearney--afterwards a general in the war of the rebellion--rode with a squadronof cavalry to the very gates of the city, and would no doubt haveentered with his little force, only at that point he was badly wounded,as were several of his officers.  He had not heard the call for a halt.General Franklin Pierce had joined the army in Mexico, at Puebla, ashort time before the advance upon the capital commenced.  He hadconsequently not been in any of the engagements of the war up to thebattle of Contreras.  By an unfortunate fall of his horse on theafternoon of the 19th he was painfully injured.  The next day, when hisbrigade, with the other troops engaged on the same field, was orderedagainst the flank and rear of the enemy guarding the different points ofthe road from San Augustin Tlalpam to the city, General Pierce attemptedto accompany them.  He was not sufficiently recovered to do so, andfainted.  This circumstance gave rise to exceedingly unfair and unjustcriticisms of him when he became a candidate for the Presidency.Whatever General Pierce's qualifications may have been for thePresidency, he was a gentleman and a man of courage.  I was not asupporter of him politically, but I knew him more intimately than I didany other of the volunteer generals.General Scott abstained from entering the city at this time, because Mr.Nicholas P. Trist, the commissioner on the part of the United States tonegotiate a treaty of peace with Mexico, was with the army, and eitherhe or General Scott thought--probably both of them--that a treaty wouldbe more possible while the Mexican government was in possession of thecapital than if it was scattered and the capital in the hands of aninvader.  Be this as it may, we did not enter at that time. The armytook up positions along the slopes of the mountains south of the city,as far west as Tacubaya.  Negotiations were at once entered into withSanta Anna, who was then practically THE GOVERNMENT and the immediatecommander of all the troops engaged in defence of the country.  A trucewas signed which denied to either party the right to strengthen itsposition, or to receive reinforcements during the continuance of thearmistices, but authorized General Scott to draw supplies for his armyfrom the city in the meantime.Negotiations were commenced at once and were kept up vigorously betweenMr. Trist and the commissioners appointed on the part of Mexico, untilthe 2d of September.  At that time Mr. Trist handed in his ultimatum.Texas was to be given up absolutely by Mexico, and New Mexico andCalifornia ceded to the United States for a stipulated sum to beafterwards determined.  I do not suppose Mr. Trist had any discretionwhatever in regard to boundaries. The war was one of conquest, in theinterest of an institution, and the probabilities are that privateinstructions were for the acquisition of territory out of which newStates might be carved.  At all events the Mexicans felt so outraged atthe terms proposed that they commenced preparations for defence, withoutgiving notice of the termination of the armistice.  The terms of thetruce had been violated before, when teams had been sent into the cityto bring out supplies for the army.  The first train entering the citywas very severely threatened by a mob. This, however, was apologized forby the authorities and all responsibility for it denied; and thereafter,to avoid exciting the Mexican people and soldiery, our teams with theirescorts were sent in at night, when the troops were in barracks and thecitizens in bed.  The circumstance was overlooked and negotiationscontinued.  As soon as the news reached General Scott of the secondviolation of the armistice, about the 4th of September, he wrote avigorous note to President Santa Anna, calling his attention to it, and,receiving an unsatisfactory reply, declared the armistice at an end.General Scott, with Worth's division, was now occupying Tacubaya, avillage some four miles south-west of the City of Mexico, and extendingfrom the base up the mountain-side for the distance of half a mile.More than a mile west, and also a little above the plain, stands Molinodel Rey.  The mill is a long stone structure, one story high and severalhundred feet in length.  At the period of which I speak General Scottsupposed a portion of the mill to be used as a foundry for the castingof guns.  This, however, proved to be a mistake.  It was valuable to theMexicans because of the quantity of grain it contained. The building isflat roofed, and a line of sand-bags over the outer walls rendered thetop quite a formidable defence for infantry.  Chapultepec is a moundspringing up from the plain to the height of probably three hundredfeet, and almost in a direct line between Molino del Rey and the westernpart of the city.  It was fortified both on the top and on the rocky andprecipitous sides.The City of Mexico is supplied with water by two aqueducts, resting onstrong stone arches.  One of these aqueducts draws its supply of waterfrom a mountain stream coming into it at or near Molino del Rey, andruns north close to the west base of Chapultepec; thence along thecentre of a wide road, until it reaches the road running east into thecity by the Garita San Cosme; from which point the aqueduct and roadboth run east to the city.  The second aqueduct starts from the eastbase of Chapultepec, where it is fed by a spring, and runs north-east tothe city.  This aqueduct, like the other, runs in the middle of a broadroad-way, thus leaving a space on each side.  The arches supporting theaqueduct afforded protection for advancing troops as well as to thoseengaged defensively.  At points on the San Cosme road parapets werethrown across, with an embrasure for a single piece of artillery ineach.  At the point where both road and aqueduct turn at right anglesfrom north to east, there was not only one of these parapets supplied byone gun and infantry supports, but the houses to the north of the SanCosme road, facing south and commanding a view of the road back toChapultepec, were covered with infantry, protected by parapets made ofsandbags.  The roads leading to garitas (the gates) San Cosme and Belen,by which these aqueducts enter the city, were strongly intrenched.Deep, wide ditches, filled with water, lined the sides of both roads.Such were the defences of the City of Mexico in September, 1847, on theroutes over which General Scott entered.Prior to the Mexican war General Scott had been very partial to GeneralWorth--indeed he continued so up to the close of hostilities--but, forsome reason, Worth had become estranged from his chief.  Scott evidentlytook this coldness somewhat to heart.  He did not retaliate, however,but on the contrary showed every disposition to appease his subordinate.It was understood at the time that he gave Worth authority to plan andexecute the battle of Molino del Rey without dictation or interferencefrom any one, for the very purpose of restoring their former relations.The effort failed, and the two generals remained ever after cold andindifferent towards each other, if not actually hostile.The battle of Molino del Rey was fought on the 8th of September.  Thenight of the 7th, Worth sent for his brigade and regimental commanders,with their staffs, to come to his quarters to receive instructions forthe morrow.  These orders contemplated a movement up to within strikingdistance of the Mills before daylight.  The engineers had reconnoitredthe ground as well as possible, and had acquired all the informationnecessary to base proper orders both for approach and attack.By daylight on the morning of the 8th, the troops to be engaged atMolino were all at the places designated.  The ground in front of theMills, to the south, was commanded by the artillery from the summit ofChapultepec as well as by the lighter batteries at hand; but a chargewas made, and soon all was over.  Worth's troops entered the Mills byevery door, and the enemy beat a hasty retreat back to Chapultepec.  Hadthis victory been followed up promptly, no doubt Americans and Mexicanswould have gone over the defences of Chapultepec so near together thatthe place would have fallen into our hands without further loss.  Thedefenders of the works could not have fired upon us without endangeringtheir own men.  This was not done, and five days later more valuablelives were sacrificed to carry works which had been so nearly in ourpossession on the 8th.  I do not criticise the failure to captureChapultepec at this time.  The result that followed the first assaultcould not possibly have been foreseen, and to profit by the unexpectedadvantage, the commanding general must have been on the spot and giventhe necessary instructions at the moment, or the troops must have kepton without orders.  It is always, however, in order to follow aretreating foe, unless stopped or otherwise directed.  The loss on ourside at Molino del Rey was severe for the numbers engaged.  It wasespecially so among commissioned officers.I was with the earliest of the troops to enter the Mills.  In passingthrough to the north side, looking towards Chapultepec, I happened tonotice that there were armed Mexicans still on top of the building, onlya few feet from many of our men.  Not seeing any stairway or ladderreaching to the top of the building, I took a few soldiers, and had acart that happened to be standing near brought up, and, placing theshafts against the wall and chocking the wheels so that the cart couldnot back, used the shafts as a sort of ladder extending to within threeor four feet of the top.  By this I climbed to the roof of the building,followed by a few men, but found a private soldier had preceded me bysome other way.  There were still quite a number of Mexicans on theroof, among them a major and five or six officers of lower grades, whohad not succeeded in getting away before our troops occupied thebuilding.  They still had their arms, while the soldier before mentionedwas walking as sentry, guarding the prisoners he had SURROUNDED, all byhimself.  I halted the sentinel, received the swords from thecommissioned officers, and proceeded, with the assistance of thesoldiers now with me, to disable the muskets by striking them againstthe edge of the wall, and throw them to the ground below.Molino del Rey was now captured, and the troops engaged, with theexception of an appropriate guard over the captured position andproperty, were marched back to their quarters in Tacubaya. Theengagement did not last many minutes, but the killed and wounded werenumerous for the number of troops engaged.During the night of the 11th batteries were established which could playupon the fortifications of Chapultepec.  The bombardment commenced earlyon the morning of the 12th, but there was no further engagement duringthis day than that of the artillery.  General Scott assigned the captureof Chapultepec to General Pillow, but did not leave the details to hisjudgment. Two assaulting columns, two hundred and fifty men each,composed of volunteers for the occasion, were formed.  They werecommanded by Captains McKinzie and Casey respectively.  The assault wassuccessful, but bloody.In later years, if not at the time, the battles of Molino del Rey andChapultepec have seemed to me to have been wholly unnecessary.  When theassaults upon the garitas of San Cosme and Belen were determined upon,the road running east to the former gate could have been reached easily,without an engagement, by moving along south of the Mills until west ofthem sufficiently far to be out of range, thence north to the road abovementioned; or, if desirable to keep the two attacking columns nearertogether, the troops could have been turned east so as to come on theaqueduct road out of range of the guns from Chapultepec.  In likemanner, the troops designated to act against Belen could have kept eastof Chapultepec, out of range, and come on to the aqueduct, also out ofrange of Chapultepec. Molino del Rey and Chapultepec would both havebeen necessarily evacuated if this course had been pursued, for theywould have been turned.General Quitman, a volunteer from the State of Mississippi, who stoodwell with the army both as a soldier and as a man, commanded the columnacting against Belen.  General Worth commanded the column against SanCosme.  When Chapultepec fell the advance commenced along the twoaqueduct roads.  I was on the road to San Cosme, and witnessed most thattook place on that route.  When opposition was encountered our troopssheltered themselves by keeping under the arches supporting theaqueduct, advancing an arch at a time.  We encountered no seriousobstruction until within gun-shot of the point where the road we were onintersects that running east to the city, the point where the aqueductturns at a right angle.  I have described the defences of this positionbefore.  There were but three commissioned officers besides myself, thatI can now call to mind, with the advance when the above position wasreached. One of these officers was a Lieutenant Semmes, of the MarineCorps.  I think Captain Gore, and Lieutenant Judah, of the 4th infantry,were the others.  Our progress was stopped for the time by the singlepiece of artillery at the angle of the roads and the infantry occupyingthe house-tops back from it.West of the road from where we were, stood a house occupying thesouth-west angle made by the San Cosme road and the road we were movingupon. A stone wall ran from the house along each of these roads for aconsiderable distance and thence back until it joined, enclosing quite ayard about the house.  I watched my opportunity and skipped across theroad and behind the south wall.  Proceeding cautiously to the westcorner of the enclosure, I peeped around and seeing nobody, continued,still cautiously, until the road running east and west was reached.  Ithen returned to the troops, and called for volunteers.  All that wereclose to me, or that heard me, about a dozen, offered their services.Commanding them to carry their arms at a trail, I watched ouropportunity and got them across the road and under cover of the wallbeyond, before the enemy had a shot at us. Our men under cover of thearches kept a close watch on the intrenchments that crossed our path andthe house-tops beyond, and whenever a head showed itself above theparapets they would fire at it.  Our crossing was thus made practicablewithout loss.When we reached a safe position I instructed my little command again tocarry their arms at a trail, not to fire at the enemy until they wereordered, and to move very cautiously following me until the San Cosmeroad was reached; we would then be on the flank of the men serving thegun on the road, and with no obstruction between us and them.  When wereached the south-west corner of the enclosure before described, I sawsome United States troops pushing north through a shallow ditch near by,who had come up since my reconnaissance.  This was the company ofCaptain Horace Brooks, of the artillery, acting as infantry.  Iexplained to Brooks briefly what I had discovered and what I was aboutto do.  He said, as I knew the ground and he did not, I might go on andhe would follow.  As soon as we got on the road leading to the city thetroops serving the gun on the parapet retreated, and those on thehouse-tops near by followed; our men went after them in such closepursuit--the troops we had left under the arches joining--that a secondline across the road, about half-way between the first and the garita,was carried. No reinforcements had yet come up except Brooks's company,and the position we had taken was too advanced to be held by so small aforce.  It was given up, but retaken later in the day, with some loss.Worth's command gradually advanced to the front now open to it.  Laterin the day in reconnoitring I found a church off to the south of theroad, which looked to me as if the belfry would command the ground backof the garita San Cosme.  I got an officer of the voltigeurs, with amountain howitzer and men to work it, to go with me.  The road being inpossession of the enemy, we had to take the field to the south to reachthe church.  This took us over several ditches breast deep in water andgrown up with water plants.  These ditches, however, were not over eightor ten feet in width.  The howitzer was taken to pieces and carried bythe men to its destination.  When I knocked for admission a priest cameto the door who, while extremely polite, declined to admit us.  With thelittle Spanish then at my command, I explained to him that he might saveproperty by opening the door, and he certainly would save himself frombecoming a prisoner, for a time at least; and besides, I intended to goin whether he consented or not.  He began to see his duty in the samelight that I did, and opened the door, though he did not look as if itgave him special pleasure to do so.  The gun was carried to the belfryand put together.  We were not more than two or three hundred yards fromSan Cosme.  The shots from our little gun dropped in upon the enemy andcreated great confusion.  Why they did not send out a small party andcapture us, I do not know.  We had no infantry or other defences besidesour one gun.The effect of this gun upon the troops about the gate of the city was somarked that General Worth saw it from his position. (*3) He was sopleased that he sent a staff officer, Lieutenant Pemberton--laterLieutenant-General commanding the defences of Vicksburg--to bring me tohim.  He expressed his gratification at the services the howitzer in thechurch steeple was doing, saying that every shot was effective, andordered a captain of voltigeurs to report to me with another howitzer tobe placed along with the one already rendering so much service.  I couldnot tell the General that there was not room enough in the steeple foranother gun, because he probably would have looked upon such a statementas a contradiction from a second lieutenant.  I took the captain withme, but did not use his gun.The night of the 13th of September was spent by the troops under GeneralWorth in the houses near San Cosme, and in line confronting the generalline of the enemy across to Belen.  The troops that I was with were inthe houses north of the road leading into the city, and were engagedduring the night in cutting passage-ways from one house to anothertowards the town.  During the night Santa Anna, with his army--exceptthe deserters--left the city.  He liberated all the convicts confined inthe town, hoping, no doubt, that they would inflict upon us some injurybefore daylight; but several hours after Santa Anna was out of the way,the city authorities sent a delegation to General Scott to ask--if notdemand--an armistice, respecting church property, the rights of citizensand the supremacy of the city government in the management of municipalaffairs.  General Scott declined to trammel himself with conditions, butgave assurances that those who chose to remain within our lines would beprotected so long as they behaved themselves properly.General Quitman had advanced along his line very successfully on the13th, so that at night his command occupied nearly the same position atBelen that Worth's troops did about San Cosme. After the interview aboverelated between General Scott and the city council, orders were issuedfor the cautious entry of both columns in the morning.  The troops underWorth were to stop at the Alameda, a park near the west end of the city.Quitman was to go directly to the Plaza, and take possession of thePalace--a mass of buildings on the east side in which Congress has itssessions, the national courts are held, the public offices are alllocated, the President resides, and much room is left for museums,receptions, etc.  This is the building generally designated as the'Halls of the Montezumas.'
ISFP	 XII.PROMOTION TO FIRST LIEUTENANT--CAPTURE OF THE CITY OF MEXICO--THE ARMY--MEXICAN SOLDIERS--PEACE NEGOTIATIONS.On entering the city the troops were fired upon by the releasedconvicts, and possibly by deserters and hostile citizens.  The streetswere deserted, and the place presented the appearance of a 'city of thedead,' except for this firing by unseen persons from house-tops,windows, and around corners.  In this firing the lieutenant-colonel ofmy regiment, Garland, was badly wounded, Lieutenant Sidney Smith, of the4th infantry, was also wounded mortally.  He died a few days after, andby his death I was promoted to the grade of first lieutenant.(*4)  I hadgone into the battle of Palo Alto in May, 1846, a second lieutenant, andI entered the city of Mexico sixteen months later with the same rank,after having been in all the engagements possible for any one man and ina regiment that lost more officers during the war than it ever hadpresent at any one engagement.  My regiment lost four commissionedofficers, all senior to me, by steamboat explosions during the Mexicanwar.  The Mexicans were not so discriminating.  They sometimes pickedoff my juniors.General Scott soon followed the troops into the city, in state.  Iwonder that he was not fired upon, but I believe he was not; at allevents he was not hurt.  He took quarters at first in the 'Halls of theMontezumas,' and from there issued his wise and discreet orders for thegovernment of a conquered city, and for suppressing the hostile acts ofliberated convicts already spoken of--orders which challenge the respectof all who study them.  Lawlessness was soon suppressed, and the City ofMexico settled down into a quiet, law-abiding place.  The people beganto make their appearance upon the streets without fear of the invaders.Shortly afterwards the bulk of the troops were sent from the city to thevillages at the foot of the mountains, four or five miles to the southand south-west.Whether General Scott approved of the Mexican war and the manner inwhich it was brought about, I have no means of knowing.  His orders totroops indicate only a soldierly spirit, with probably a little regardfor the perpetuation of his own fame.  On the other hand, GeneralTaylor's, I think, indicate that he considered the administrationaccountable for the war, and felt no responsibility resting on himselffurther than for the faithful performance of his duties.  Both generalsdeserve the commendations of their countrymen and to live in thegrateful memory of this people to the latest generation.Earlier in this narrative I have stated that the plain, reached afterpassing the mountains east of Perote, extends to the cities of Pueblaand Mexico.  The route travelled by the army before reaching Puebla,goes over a pass in a spur of mountain coming up from the south.  Thispass is very susceptible of defence by a smaller against a larger force.Again, the highest point of the road-bed between Vera Cruz and the Cityof Mexico is over Rio Frio mountain, which also might have beensuccessfully defended by an inferior against a superior force.  But bymoving north of the mountains, and about thirty miles north of Puebla,both of these passes would have been avoided.  The road from Perote tothe City of Mexico, by this latter route, is as level as the prairies inour West.  Arriving due north from Puebla, troops could have beendetached to take possession of that place, and then proceeding west withthe rest of the army no mountain would have been encountered beforereaching the City of Mexico.  It is true this road would have broughttroops in by Guadalupe--a town, church and detached spur of mountainabout two miles north of the capital, all bearing the same general name--and at this point Lake Texcoco comes near to the mountain, which wasfortified both at the base and on the sides:  but troops could havepassed north of the mountain and come in only a few miles to thenorth-west, and so flanked the position, as they actually did on thesouth.It has always seemed to me that this northern route to the City ofMexico, would have been the better one to have taken.  But my laterexperience has taught me two lessons:  first, that things are seenplainer after the events have occurred; second, that the most confidentcritics are generally those who know the least about the mattercriticised.  I know just enough about the Mexican war to approveheartily of most of the generalship, but to differ with a little of it.It is natural that an important city like Puebla should not have beenpassed with contempt; it may be natural that the direct road to itshould have been taken; but it could have been passed, its evacuationinsured and possession acquired without danger of encountering the enemyin intricate mountain defiles.  In this same way the City of Mexicocould have been approached without any danger of opposition, except inthe open field.But General Scott's successes are an answer to all criticism. He invadeda populous country, penetrating two hundred and sixty miles into theinterior, with a force at no time equal to one-half of that opposed tohim; he was without a base; the enemy was always intrenched, always onthe defensive; yet he won every battle, he captured the capital, andconquered the government.  Credit is due to the troops engaged, it istrue, but the plans and the strategy were the general's.I had now made marches and been in battle under both General Scott andGeneral Taylor.  The former divided his force of 10,500 men into fourcolumns, starting a day apart, in moving from Puebla to the capital ofthe nation, when it was known that an army more than twice as large ashis own stood ready to resist his coming.  The road was broad and thecountry open except in crossing the Rio Frio mountain.  General Taylorpursued the same course in marching toward an enemy.  He moved even insmaller bodies.  I never thought at the time to doubt the infallibilityof these two generals in all matters pertaining to their profession.  Isupposed they moved in small bodies because more men could not be passedover a single road on the same day with their artillery and necessarytrains.  Later I found the fallacy of this belief.  The rebellion, whichfollowed as a sequence to the Mexican war, never could have beensuppressed if larger bodies of men could not have been moved at the sametime than was the custom under Scott and Taylor.The victories in Mexico were, in every instance, over vastly superiornumbers.  There were two reasons for this.  Both General Scott andGeneral Taylor had such armies as are not often got together.  At thebattles of Palo Alto and Resaca-de-la-Palma, General Taylor had a smallarmy, but it was composed exclusively of regular troops, under the bestof drill and discipline.  Every officer, from the highest to the lowest,was educated in his profession, not at West Point necessarily, but inthe camp, in garrison, and many of them in Indian wars. The rank andfile were probably inferior, as material out of which to make an army,to the volunteers that participated in all the later battles of the war;but they were brave men, and then drill and discipline brought out allthere was in them.  A better army, man for man, probably never faced anenemy than the one commanded by General Taylor in the earliest twoengagements of the Mexican war.  The volunteers who followed were ofbetter material, but without drill or discipline at the start.  Theywere associated with so many disciplined men and professionally educatedofficers, that when they went into engagements it was with a confidencethey would not have felt otherwise.  They became soldiers themselvesalmost at once.  All these conditions we would enjoy again in case ofwar.The Mexican army of that day was hardly an organization.  The privatesoldier was picked up from the lower class of the inhabitants whenwanted; his consent was not asked; he was poorly clothed, worse fed, andseldom paid.  He was turned adrift when no longer wanted.  The officersof the lower grades were but little superior to the men.  With all thisI have seen as brave stands made by some of these men as I have everseen made by soldiers.  Now Mexico has a standing army larger than thatof the United States.  They have a military school modelled after WESTJoint.  Their officers are educated and, no doubt, generally brave.  TheMexican war of 1846-8 would be an impossibility in this generation.The Mexicans have shown a patriotism which it would be well if we wouldimitate in part, but with more regard to truth.  They celebrate theanniversaries of Chapultepec and Molino del Rey as of very greatvictories.  The anniversaries are recognized as national holidays.  Atthese two battles, while the United States troops were victorious, itwas at very great sacrifice of life compared with what the Mexicanssuffered.  The Mexicans, as on many other occasions, stood up as well asany troops ever did.  The trouble seemed to be the lack of experienceamong the officers, which led them after a certain time to simply quit,without being particularly whipped, but because they had fought enough.Their authorities of the present day grow enthusiastic over their themewhen telling of these victories, and speak with pride of the large sumof money they forced us to pay in the end.  With us, now twenty yearsafter the close of the most stupendous war ever known, we have writers--who profess devotion to the nation--engaged in trying to prove that theUnion forces were not victorious; practically, they say, we were slashedaround from Donelson to Vicksburg and to Chattanooga; and in the Eastfrom Gettysburg to Appomattox, when the physical rebellion gave out fromsheer exhaustion.  There is no difference in the amount of romance inthe two stories.I would not have the anniversaries of our victories celebrated, northose of our defeats made fast days and spent in humiliation and prayer;but I would like to see truthful history written. Such history will dofull credit to the courage, endurance and soldierly ability of theAmerican citizen, no matter what section of the country he hailed from,or in what ranks he fought.  The justice of the cause which in the endprevailed, will, I doubt not, come to be acknowledged by every citizenof the land, in time.  For the present, and so long as there are livingwitnesses of the great war of sections, there will be people who willnot be consoled for the loss of a cause which they believed to be holy.As time passes, people, even of the South, will begin to wonder how itwas possible that their ancestors ever fought for or justifiedinstitutions which acknowledged the right of property in man.After the fall of the capital and the dispersal of the government ofMexico, it looked very much as if military occupation of the country fora long time might be necessary. General Scott at once began thepreparation of orders, regulations and laws in view of this contingency.He contemplated making the country pay all the expenses of theoccupation, without the army becoming a perceptible burden upon thepeople.  His plan was to levy a direct tax upon the separate states, andcollect, at the ports left open to trade, a duty on all imports.  Fromthe beginning of the war private property had not been taken, either forthe use of the army or of individuals, without full compensation.  Thispolicy was to be pursued.  There were not troops enough in the valley ofMexico to occupy many points, but now that there was no organized armyof the enemy of any size, reinforcements could be got from the RioGrande, and there were also new volunteers arriving from time to time,all by way of Vera Cruz.  Military possession was taken of Cuernavaca,fifty miles south of the City of Mexico; of Toluca, nearly as far west,and of Pachuca, a mining town of great importance, some sixty miles tothe north-east.  Vera Cruz, Jalapa, Orizaba, and Puebla were already inour possession.Meanwhile the Mexican government had departed in the person of SantaAnna, and it looked doubtful for a time whether the United Statescommissioner, Mr. Trist, would find anybody to negotiate with.  Atemporary government, however, was soon established at Queretaro, andTrist began negotiations for a conclusion of the war.  Before terms werefinally agreed upon he was ordered back to Washington, but General Scottprevailed upon him to remain, as an arrangement had been so nearlyreached, and the administration must approve his acts if he succeeded inmaking such a treaty as had been contemplated in his instructions.  Thetreaty was finally signed the 2d of February, 1848, and accepted by thegovernment at Washington.  It is that known as the 'Treaty of GuadalupeHidalgo,' and secured to the United States the Rio Grande as theboundary of Texas, and the whole territory then included in New Mexicoand Upper California, for the sum of $15,000,000.Soon after entering the city of Mexico, the opposition of GeneralsPillow, Worth and Colonel Duncan to General Scott became very marked.Scott claimed that they had demanded of the President his removal.  I donot know whether this is so or not, but I do know of their unconcealedhostility to their chief.  At last he placed them in arrest, andpreferred charges against them of insubordination and disrespect.  Thisact brought on a crisis in the career of the general commanding.  He hadasserted from the beginning that the administration was hostile to him;that it had failed in its promises of men and war material; that thePresident himself had shown duplicity if not treachery in the endeavorto procure the appointment of Benton:  and the administration now gaveopen evidence of its enmity.  About the middle of February orders cameconvening a court of inquiry, composed of Brevet Brigadier-GeneralTowson, the paymaster-general of the army, Brigadier-General Cushing andColonel Belknap, to inquire into the conduct of the accused and theaccuser, and shortly afterwards orders were received from Washington,relieving Scott of the command of the army in the field and assigningMajor-General William O. Butler of Kentucky to the place.  This orderalso released Pillow, Worth and Duncan from arrest.If a change was to be made the selection of General Butler was agreeableto every one concerned, so far as I remember to have heard expressionson the subject.  There were many who regarded the treatment of GeneralScott as harsh and unjust.  It is quite possible that the vanity of theGeneral had led him to say and do things that afforded a plausiblepretext to the administration for doing just what it did and what it hadwanted to do from the start.  The court tried the accuser quite as muchas the accused.  It was adjourned before completing its labors, to meetin Frederick, Maryland.  General Scott left the country, and never afterhad more than the nominal command of the army until early in 1861.  Hecertainly was not sustained in his efforts to maintain discipline inhigh places.The efforts to kill off politically the two successful generals, madethem both candidates for the Presidency.  General Taylor was nominatedin 1848, and was elected.  Four years later General Scott received thenomination but was badly beaten, and the party nominating him died withhis defeat.(*5)
ISFP	 XIII.TREATY OF PEACE--MEXICAN BULL FIGHTS--REGIMENTAL QUARTERMASTER--TRIP TOPOPOCATAPETL--TRIP TO THE CAVES OF MEXICO.The treaty of peace between the two countries was signed by thecommissioners of each side early in February, 1848.  It took aconsiderable time for it to reach Washington, receive the approval ofthe administration, and be finally ratified by the Senate.  It wasnaturally supposed by the army that there would be no more fighting, andofficers and men were of course anxious to get home, but knowing theremust be delay they contented themselves as best they could.  EverySunday there was a bull fight for the amusement of those who would paytheir fifty cents.  I attended one of them--just one--not wishing toleave the country without having witnessed the national sport.  Thesight to me was sickening.  I could not see how human beings could enjoythe sufferings of beasts, and often of men, as they seemed to do onthese occasions.At these sports there are usually from four to six bulls sacrificed.The audience occupies seats around the ring in which the exhibition isgiven, each seat but the foremost rising higher than the one in front,so that every one can get a full view of the sport.  When all is ready abull is turned into the ring.  Three or four men come in, mounted on themerest skeletons of horses blind or blind-folded and so weak that theycould not make a sudden turn with their riders without danger of fallingdown.  The men are armed with spears having a point as sharp as aneedle.  Other men enter the arena on foot, armed with red flags andexplosives about the size of a musket cartridge.  To each of theseexplosives is fastened a barbed needle which serves the purpose ofattaching them to the bull by running the needle into the skin.  Beforethe animal is turned loose a lot of these explosives are attached tohim.  The pain from the pricking of the skin by the needles isexasperating; but when the explosions of the cartridges commence theanimal becomes frantic.  As he makes a lunge towards one horseman,another runs a spear into him.  He turns towards his last tormentor whena man on foot holds out a red flag; the bull rushes for this and isallowed to take it on his horns.  The flag drops and covers the eyes ofthe animal so that he is at a loss what to do; it is jerked from him andthe torment is renewed.  When the animal is worked into anuncontrollable frenzy, the horsemen withdraw, and the matadores--literally murderers--enter, armed with knives having blades twelve oreighteen inches long, and sharp.  The trick is to dodge an attack fromthe animal and stab him to the heart as he passes. If these efforts failthe bull is finally lassoed, held fast and killed by driving a knifeblade into the spinal column just back of the horns.  He is then draggedout by horses or mules, another is let into the ring, and the sameperformance is renewed.On the occasion when I was present one of the bulls was not turned asideby the attacks in the rear, the presentations of the red flag, etc.,etc., but kept right on, and placing his horns under the flanks of ahorse threw him and his rider to the ground with great force.  The horsewas killed and the rider lay prostrate as if dead.  The bull was thenlassoed and killed in the manner above described.  Men came in andcarried the dead man off in a litter.  When the slaughtered bull andhorse were dragged out, a fresh bull was turned into the ring.Conspicuous among the spectators was the man who had been carried out ona litter but a few minutes before.  He was only dead so far as thatperformance went; but the corpse was so lively that it could not foregothe chance of witnessing the discomfiture of some of his brethren whomight not be so fortunate.  There was a feeling of disgust manifested bythe audience to find that he had come to life again.  I confess that Ifelt sorry to see the cruelty to the bull and the horse.  I did not stayfor the conclusion of the performance; but while I did stay, there wasnot a bull killed in the prescribed way.Bull fights are now prohibited in the Federal District--embracing aterritory around the City of Mexico, somewhat larger than the Districtof Columbia--and they are not an institution in any part of the country.During one of my recent visits to Mexico, bull fights were got up in myhonor at Puebla and at Pachuca.  I was not notified in advance so as tobe able to decline and thus prevent the performance; but in both cases Icivilly declined to attend.Another amusement of the people of Mexico of that day, and one whichnearly all indulged in, male and female, old and young, priest andlayman, was Monte playing.  Regular feast weeks were held every year atwhat was then known as St. Augustin Tlalpam, eleven miles out of town.There were dealers to suit every class and condition of people.  In manyof the booths tlackos--the copper coin of the country, four of themmaking six and a quarter cents of our money--were piled up in greatquantities, with some silver, to accommodate the people who could notbet more than a few pennies at a time.  In other booths silver formedthe bulk of the capital of the bank, with a few doubloons to be changedif there should be a run of luck against the bank.  In some there was nocoin except gold.  Here the rich were said to bet away their entireestates in a single day.  All this is stopped now.For myself, I was kept somewhat busy during the winter of 1847-8.  Myregiment was stationed in Tacubaya.  I was regimental quartermaster andcommissary.  General Scott had been unable to get clothing for thetroops from the North.  The men were becoming--well, they neededclothing.  Material had to be purchased, such as could be obtained, andpeople employed to make it up into 'Yankee uniforms.'  A quartermasterin the city was designated to attend to this special duty; but clothingwas so much needed that it was seized as fast as made up.  A regimentwas glad to get a dozen suits at a time.  I had to look after thismatter for the 4th infantry.  Then our regimental fund had run down andsome of the musicians in the band had been without their extra pay for anumber of months.The regimental bands at that day were kept up partly by pay from thegovernment, and partly by pay from the regimental fund. There wasauthority of law for enlisting a certain number of men as musicians.  Somany could receive the pay of non-commissioned officers of the variousgrades, and the remainder the pay of privates.  This would not secure aband leader, nor good players on certain instruments.  In garrison thereare various ways of keeping up a regimental fund sufficient to giveextra pay to musicians, establish libraries and ten-pin alleys,subscribe to magazines and furnish many extra comforts to the men.  Thebest device for supplying the fund is to issue bread to the soldiersinstead of flour.  The ration used to be eighteen ounces per day ofeither flour or bread; and one hundred pounds of flour will make onehundred and forty pounds of bread.  This saving was purchased by thecommissary for the benefit of the fund.  In the emergency the 4thinfantry was laboring under, I rented a bakery in the city, hiredbakers--Mexicans--bought fuel and whatever was necessary, and I also gota contract from the chief commissary of the army for baking a largeamount of hard bread.  In two months I made more money for the fund thanmy pay amounted to during the entire war.  While stationed at Monterey Ihad relieved the post fund in the same way.  There, however, was noprofit except in the saving of flour by converting it into bread.In the spring of 1848 a party of officers obtained leave to visitPopocatapetl, the highest volcano in America, and to take an escort.  Iwent with the party, many of whom afterwards occupied conspicuouspositions before the country.  Of those who 'went south,' and attainedhigh rank, there was Lieutenant Richard Anderson, who commanded a corpsat Spottsylvania; Captain Sibley, a major-general, and, after the war,for a number of years in the employ of the Khedive of Egypt; CaptainGeorge Crittenden, a rebel general; S. B. Buckner, who surrendered FortDonelson; and Mansfield Lovell, who commanded at New Orleans before thatcity fell into the hands of the National troops.  Of those who remainedon our side there were Captain Andrew Porter, Lieutenant C. P. Stone andLieutenant Z. B. Tower.  There were quite a number of other officers,whose names I cannot recollect.At a little village (Ozumba) near the base of Popocatapetl, where wepurposed to commence the ascent, we procured guides and two pack muleswith forage for our horses.  High up on the mountain there was adeserted house of one room, called the Vaqueria, which had been occupiedyears before by men in charge of cattle ranging on the mountain.  Thepasturage up there was very fine when we saw it, and there were stillsome cattle, descendants of the former domestic herd, which had nowbecome wild.  It was possible to go on horseback as far as the Vaqueria,though the road was somewhat hazardous in places. Sometimes it was verynarrow with a yawning precipice on one side, hundreds of feet down to aroaring mountain torrent below, and almost perpendicular walls on theother side.  At one of these places one of our mules loaded with twosacks of barley, one on each side, the two about as big as he was,struck his load against the mountain-side and was precipitated to thebottom.  The descent was steep but not perpendicular.  The mule rolledover and over until the bottom was reached, and we supposed of coursethe poor animal was dashed to pieces.  What was our surprise, not longafter we had gone into bivouac, to see the lost mule, cargo and ownercoming up the ascent.  The load had protected the animal from seriousinjury; and his owner had gone after him and found a way back to thepath leading up to the hut where we were to stay.The night at the Vaqueria was one of the most unpleasant I ever knew.It was very cold and the rain fell in torrents.  A little higher up therain ceased and snow began.  The wind blew with great velocity.  Thelog-cabin we were in had lost the roof entirely on one side, and on theother it was hardly better then a sieve.  There was little or no sleepthat night.  As soon as it was light the next morning, we started tomake the ascent to the summit.  The wind continued to blow with violenceand the weather was still cloudy, but there was neither rain nor snow.The clouds, however, concealed from our view the country below us,except at times a momentary glimpse could be got through a clear spacebetween them.  The wind carried the loose snow around the mountain-sidesin such volumes as to make it almost impossible to stand up against it.We labored on and on, until it became evident that the top could not bereached before night, if at all in such a storm, and we concluded toreturn. The descent was easy and rapid, though dangerous, until we gotbelow the snow line.  At the cabin we mounted our horses, and by nightwere at Ozumba.The fatigues of the day and the loss of sleep the night before drove usto bed early.  Our beds consisted of a place on the dirt-floor with ablanket under us.  Soon all were asleep; but long before morning firstone and then another of our party began to cry out with excruciatingpain in the eyes.  Not one escaped it.  By morning the eyes of half theparty were so swollen that they were entirely closed.  The otherssuffered pain equally.  The feeling was about what might be expectedfrom the prick of a sharp needle at a white heat.  We remained inquarters until the afternoon bathing our eyes in cold water. Thisrelieved us very much, and before night the pain had entirely left.  Theswelling, however, continued, and about half the party still had theireyes entirely closed; but we concluded to make a start back, those whocould see a little leading the horses of those who could not see at all.We moved back to the village of Ameca Ameca, some six miles, and stoppedagain for the night.  The next morning all were entirely well and freefrom pain.  The weather was clear and Popocatapetl stood out in all itsbeauty, the top looking as if not a mile away, and inviting us toreturn.  About half the party were anxious to try the ascent again, andconcluded to do so.  The remainder--I was with the remainder--concludedthat we had got all the pleasure there was to be had out of mountainclimbing, and that we would visit the great caves of Mexico, some ninetymiles from where we then were, on the road to Acapulco.The party that ascended the mountain the second time succeeded inreaching the crater at the top, with but little of the labor theyencountered in their first attempt.  Three of them--Anderson, Stone andBuckner--wrote accounts of their journey, which were published at thetime.  I made no notes of this excursion, and have read nothing about itsince, but it seems to me that I can see the whole of it as vividly asif it were but yesterday.  I have been back at Ameca Ameca, and thevillage beyond, twice in the last five years.  The scene had not changedmaterially from my recollection of it.The party which I was with moved south down the valley to the town ofCuantla, some forty miles from Ameca Ameca.  The latter stands on theplain at the foot of Popocatapetl, at an elevation of about eightthousand feet above tide water.  The slope down is gradual as thetraveller moves south, but one would not judge that, in going toCuantla, descent enough had been made to occasion a material change inthe climate and productions of the soil; but such is the case.  In themorning we left a temperate climate where the cereals and fruits arethose common to the United States, we halted in the evening in atropical climate where the orange and banana, the coffee and thesugar-cane were flourishing.  We had been travelling, apparently,on a plain all day, but in the direction of the flow of water.Soon after the capture of the City of Mexico an armistice had beenagreed to, designating the limits beyond which troops of the respectivearmies were not to go during its continuance. Our party knew nothingabout these limits.  As we approached Cuantla bugles sounded theassembly, and soldiers rushed from the guard-house in the edge of thetown towards us.  Our party halted, and I tied a white pockethandkerchief to a stick and, using it as a flag of truce, proceeded onto the town.  Captains Sibley and Porter followed a few hundred yardsbehind.  I was detained at the guard-house until a messenger could bedispatched to the quarters of the commanding general, who authorizedthat I should be conducted to him.  I had been with the general but afew minutes when the two officers following announced themselves.  TheMexican general reminded us that it was a violation of the truce for usto be there.  However, as we had no special authority from our owncommanding general, and as we knew nothing about the terms of the truce,we were permitted to occupy a vacant house outside the guard for thenight, with the promise of a guide to put us on the road to Cuernavacathe next morning.Cuernavaca is a town west of Guantla.  The country through which wepassed, between these two towns, is tropical in climate and productionsand rich in scenery.  At one point, about half-way between the twoplaces, the road goes over a low pass in the mountains in which there isa very quaint old town, the inhabitants of which at that day were nearlyall full-blooded Indians.  Very few of them even spoke Spanish.  Thehouses were built of stone and generally only one story high.  Thestreets were narrow, and had probably been paved before Cortez visitedthe country.  They had not been graded, but the paving had been done onthe natural surface.  We had with us one vehicle, a cart, which wasprobably the first wheeled vehicle that had ever passed through thattown.On a hill overlooking this town stands the tomb of an ancient king; andit was understood that the inhabitants venerated this tomb very highly,as well as the memory of the ruler who was supposed to be buried in it.We ascended the mountain and surveyed the tomb; but it showed noparticular marks of architectural taste, mechanical skill or advancedcivilization.  The next day we went into Cuernavaca.After a day's rest at Cuernavaca our party set out again on the journeyto the great caves of Mexico.  We had proceeded but a few miles when wewere stopped, as before, by a guard and notified that the terms of theexisting armistice did not permit us to go further in that direction.Upon convincing the guard that we were a mere party of pleasure seekersdesirous of visiting the great natural curiosities of the country whichwe expected soon to leave, we were conducted to a large hacienda nearby, and directed to remain there until the commanding general of thatdepartment could be communicated with and his decision obtained as towhether we should be permitted to pursue our journey.  The guardpromised to send a messenger at once, and expected a reply by night.  Atnight there was no response from the commanding general, but the captainof the guard was sure he would have a reply by morning.  Again in themorning there was no reply.  The second evening the same thing happened,and finally we learned that the guard had sent no message or messengerto the department commander.  We determined therefore to go on unlessstopped by a force sufficient to compel obedience.After a few hours' travel we came to a town where a scene similar to theone at Cuantia occurred.  The commanding officer sent a guide to conductour party around the village and to put us upon our road again.  Thiswas the last interruption:  that night we rested at a large coffeeplantation, some eight miles from the cave we were on the way to visit.It must have been a Saturday night; the peons had been paid off, andspent part of the night in gambling away their scanty week's earnings.Their coin was principally copper, and I do not believe there was a manamong them who had received as much as twenty-five cents in money.  Theywere as much excited, however, as if they had been staking thousands.  Irecollect one poor fellow, who had lost his last tlacko, pulled off hisshirt and, in the most excited manner, put that up on the turn of acard.  Monte was the game played, the place out of doors, near thewindow of the room occupied by the officers of our party.The next morning we were at the mouth of the cave at an early hour,provided with guides, candles and rockets.  We explored to a distance ofabout three miles from the entrance, and found a succession of chambersof great dimensions and of great beauty when lit up with our rockets.Stalactites and stalagmites of all sizes were discovered.  Some of theformer were many feet in diameter and extended from ceiling to floor;some of the latter were but a few feet high from the floor; but theformation is going on constantly, and many centuries hence thesestalagmites will extend to the ceiling and become complete columns.  Thestalagmites were all a little concave, and the cavities were filled withwater.  The water percolates through the roof, a drop at a time--oftenthe drops several minutes apart--and more or less charged with mineralmatter.  Evaporation goes on slowly, leaving the mineral behind.  Thisin time makes the immense columns, many of them thousands of tons inweight, which serve to support the roofs over the vast chambers.  Irecollect that at one point in the cave one of these columns is of suchhuge proportions that there is only a narrow passage left on either sideof it.  Some of our party became satisfied with their explorationsbefore we had reached the point to which the guides were accustomed totake explorers, and started back without guides.  Coming to the largecolumn spoken of, they followed it entirely around, and commencedretracing their steps into the bowels of the mountain, without beingaware of the fact.  When the rest of us had completed our explorations,we started out with our guides, but had not gone far before we saw thetorches of an approaching party.  We could not conceive who these couldbe, for all of us had come in together, and there were none butourselves at the entrance when we started in. Very soon we found it wasour friends.  It took them some time to conceive how they had got wherethey were.  They were sure they had kept straight on for the mouth ofthe cave, and had gone about far enough to have reached it.
ISFP	 XIV.RETURN OF THE ARMY--MARRIAGE--ORDERED TO THE PACIFIC COAST--CROSSING THEISTHMUS--ARRIVAL AT SAN FRANCISCO.My experience in the Mexican war was of great advantage to meafterwards.  Besides the many practical lessons it taught, the warbrought nearly all the officers of the regular army together so as tomake them personally acquainted.  It also brought them in contact withvolunteers, many of whom served in the war of the rebellion afterwards.Then, in my particular case, I had been at West Point at about the righttime to meet most of the graduates who were of a suitable age at thebreaking out of the rebellion to be trusted with large commands.Graduating in 1843, I was at the military academy from one to four yearswith all cadets who graduated between 1840 and 1846--seven classes.These classes embraced more than fifty officers who afterwards becamegenerals on one side or the other in the rebellion, many of them holdinghigh commands.  All the older officers, who became conspicuous in therebellion, I had also served with and known in Mexico:  Lee, J. E.Johnston, A. S. Johnston, Holmes, Hebert and a number of others on theConfederate side; McCall, Mansfield, Phil. Kearney and others on theNational side.  The acquaintance thus formed was of immense service tome in the war of the rebellion--I mean what I learned of the charactersof those to whom I was afterwards opposed.  I do not pretend to say thatall movements, or even many of them, were made with special reference tothe characteristics of the commander against whom they were directed.But my appreciation of my enemies was certainly affected by thisknowledge.  The natural disposition of most people is to clothe acommander of a large army whom they do not know, with almost superhumanabilities.  A large part of the National army, for instance, and most ofthe press of the country, clothed General Lee with just such qualities,but I had known him personally, and knew that he was mortal; and it wasjust as well that I felt this.The treaty of peace was at last ratified, and the evacuation of Mexicoby United States troops was ordered.  Early in June the troops in theCity of Mexico began to move out.  Many of them, including the brigadeto which I belonged, were assembled at Jalapa, above the vomito, toawait the arrival of transports at Vera Cruz:  but with all thisprecaution my regiment and others were in camp on the sand beach in aJuly sun, for about a week before embarking, while the fever raged withgreat virulence in Vera Cruz, not two miles away.  I can call to mindonly one person, an officer, who died of the disease.  My regiment wassent to Pascagoula, Mississippi, to spend the summer.  As soon as it wassettled in camp I obtained a leave of absence for four months andproceeded to St. Louis.  On the 22d of August, 1848, I was married toMiss Julia Dent, the lady of whom I have before spoken.  We visited myparents and relations in Ohio, and, at the end of my leave, proceeded tomy post at Sackett's Harbor, New York.  In April following I was orderedto Detroit, Michigan, where two years were spent with but few importantincidents.The present constitution of the State of Michigan was ratified duringthis time.  By the terms of one of its provisions, all citizens of theUnited States residing within the State at the time of the ratificationbecame citizens of Michigan also. During my stay in Detroit there was anelection for city officers.  Mr. Zachariah Chandler was the candidate ofthe Whigs for the office of Mayor, and was elected, although the citywas then reckoned democratic.  All the officers stationed there at thetime who offered their votes were permitted to cast them.  I did notoffer mine, however, as I did not wish to consider myself a citizen ofMichigan.  This was Mr. Chandler's first entry into politics, a careerhe followed ever after with great success, and in which he died enjoyingthe friendship, esteem and love of his countrymen.In the spring of 1851 the garrison at Detroit was transferred toSackett's Harbor, and in the following spring the entire 4th infantrywas ordered to the Pacific Coast.  It was decided that Mrs. Grant shouldvisit my parents at first for a few months, and then remain with her ownfamily at their St. Louis home until an opportunity offered of sendingfor her.  In the month of April the regiment was assembled at Governor'sIsland, New York Harbor, and on the 5th of July eight companies sailedfor Aspinwall.  We numbered a little over seven hundred persons,including the families of officers and soldiers.  Passage was securedfor us on the old steamer Ohio, commanded at the time by CaptainSchenck, of the navy.  It had not been determined, until a day or twobefore starting, that the 4th infantry should go by the Ohio;consequently, a complement of passengers had already been secured.  Theaddition of over seven hundred to this list crowded the steamer mostuncomfortably, especially for the tropics in July.In eight days Aspinwall was reached.  At that time the streets of thetown were eight or ten inches under water, and foot passengers passedfrom place to place on raised foot-walks. July is at the height of thewet season, on the Isthmus.  At intervals the rain would pour down instreams, followed in not many minutes by a blazing, tropical summer'ssun.  These alternate changes, from rain to sunshine, were continuous inthe afternoons.  I wondered how any person could live many months inAspinwall, and wondered still more why any one tried.In the summer of 1852 the Panama railroad was completed only to thepoint where it now crosses the Chagres River.  From there passengerswere carried by boats to Gorgona, at which place they took mules forPanama, some twenty-five miles further.  Those who travelled over theIsthmus in those days will remember that boats on the Chagres River werepropelled by natives not inconveniently burdened with clothing.  Theseboats carried thirty to forty passengers each.  The crews consisted ofsix men to a boat, armed with long poles.  There were planks wide enoughfor a man to walk on conveniently, running along the sides of each boatfrom end to end.  The men would start from the bow, place one end oftheir poles against the river bottom, brace their shoulders against theother end, and then walk to the stern as rapidly as they could.  In thisway from a mile to a mile and a half an hour could be made, against thecurrent of the river.I, as regimental quartermaster, had charge of the public property andhad also to look after the transportation.  A contract had been enteredinto with the steamship company in New York for the transportation ofthe regiment to California, including the Isthmus transit.  A certainamount of baggage was allowed per man, and saddle animals were to befurnished to commissioned officers and to all disabled persons.  Theregiment, with the exception of one company left as guards to the publicproperty--camp and garrison equipage principally--and the soldiers withfamilies, took boats, propelled as above described, for Gorgona.  Fromthis place they marched to Panama, and were soon comfortably on thesteamer anchored in the bay, some three or four miles from the town.  I,with one company of troops and all the soldiers with families, all thetents, mess chests and camp kettles, was sent to Cruces, a town a fewmiles higher up the Chagres River than Gorgona.  There I found animpecunious American who had taken the contract to furnishtransportation for the regiment at a stipulated price per hundred poundsfor the freight and so much for each saddle animal.  But when we reachedCruces there was not a mule, either for pack or saddle, in the place.The contractor promised that the animals should be on hand in themorning.  In the morning he said that they were on the way from someimaginary place, and would arrive in the course of the day.  This wenton until I saw that he could not procure the animals at all at the pricehe had promised to furnish them for.  The unusual number of passengersthat had come over on the steamer, and the large amount of freight topack, had created an unprecedented demand for mules.  Some of thepassengers paid as high as forty dollars for the use of a mule to ridetwenty-five miles, when the mule would not have sold for ten dollars inthat market at other times. Meanwhile the cholera had broken out, andmen were dying every hour.  To diminish the food for the disease, Ipermitted the company detailed with me to proceed to Panama.  Thecaptain and the doctors accompanied the men, and I was left alone withthe sick and the soldiers who had families.  The regiment at Panama wasalso affected with the disease; but there were better accommodations forthe well on the steamer, and a hospital, for those taken with thedisease, on an old hulk anchored a mile off.  There were also hospitaltents on shore on the island of Flamingo, which stands in the bay.I was about a week at Cruces before transportation began to come in.About one-third of the people with me died, either at Cruces or on theway to Panama.  There was no agent of the transportation company atCruces to consult, or to take the responsibility of procuringtransportation at a price which would secure it.  I therefore myselfdismissed the contractor and made a new contract with a native, at morethan double the original price.  Thus we finally reached Panama.  Thesteamer, however, could not proceed until the cholera abated, and theregiment was detained still longer.  Altogether, on the Isthmus and onthe Pacific side, we were delayed six weeks.  About one-seventh of thosewho left New York harbor with the 4th infantry on the 5th of July, nowlie buried on the Isthmus of Panama or on Flamingo island in Panama Bay.One amusing circumstance occurred while we were lying at anchor inPanama Bay.  In the regiment there was a Lieutenant Slaughter who wasvery liable to sea-sickness.  It almost made him sick to see the wave ofa table-cloth when the servants were spreading it.  Soon after hisgraduation, Slaughter was ordered to California and took passage by asailing vessel going around Cape Horn.  The vessel was seven monthsmaking the voyage, and Slaughter was sick every moment of the time,never more so than while lying at anchor after reaching his place ofdestination. On landing in California he found orders which had come bythe Isthmus, notifying him of a mistake in his assignment; he shouldhave been ordered to the northern lakes.  He started back by the Isthmusroute and was sick all the way.  But when he arrived at the East he wasagain ordered to California, this time definitely, and at this date wasmaking his third trip.  He was as sick as ever, and had been so for morethan a month while lying at anchor in the bay.  I remember him well,seated with his elbows on the table in front of him, his chin betweenhis hands, and looking the picture of despair.  At last he broke out, 'Iwish I had taken my father's advice; he wanted me to go into the navy;if I had done so, I should not have had to go to sea so much.'  PoorSlaughter! it was his last sea voyage.  He was killed by Indians inOregon.By the last of August the cholera had so abated that it was deemed safeto start.  The disease did not break out again on the way to California,and we reached San Francisco early in September.
ISFP	 XV.SAN FRANCISCO--EARLY CALIFORNIA EXPERIENCES--LIFE ON THE PACIFIC COAST--PROMOTED CAPTAIN--FLUSH TIMES IN CALIFORNIA.San Francisco at that day was a lively place.  Gold, or placer diggingas it was called, was at its height.  Steamers plied daily between SanFrancisco and both Stockton and Sacramento. Passengers and gold from thesouthern mines came by the Stockton boat; from the northern mines bySacramento.  In the evening when these boats arrived, Long Wharf--therewas but one wharf in San Francisco in 1852--was alive with peoplecrowding to meet the miners as they came down to sell their 'dust' andto 'have a time.'  Of these some were runners for hotels, boardinghouses or restaurants; others belonged to a class of impecuniousadventurers, of good manners and good presence, who were ever on thealert to make the acquaintance of people with some ready means, in thehope of being asked to take a meal at a restaurant.  Many were young menof good family, good education and gentlemanly instincts.  Their parentshad been able to support them during their minority, and to give themgood educations, but not to maintain them afterwards.  From 1849 to 1853there was a rush of people to the Pacific coast, of the class described.All thought that fortunes were to be picked up, without effort, in thegold fields on the Pacific.  Some realized more than their most sanguineexpectations; but for one such there were hundreds disappointed, many ofwhom now fill unknown graves; others died wrecks of their former selves,and many, without a vicious instinct, became criminals and outcasts.Many of the real scenes in early California life exceed in strangenessand interest any of the mere products of the brain of the novelist.Those early days in California brought out character.  It was a long wayoff then, and the journey was expensive.  The fortunate could go by CapeHorn or by the Isthmus of Panama; but the mass of pioneers crossed theplains with their ox-teams.  This took an entire summer.  They were verylucky when they got through with a yoke of worn-out cattle.  All othermeans were exhausted in procuring the outfit on the Missouri River.  Theimmigrant, on arriving, found himself a stranger, in a strange land, farfrom friends.  Time pressed, for the little means that could be realizedfrom the sale of what was left of the outfit would not support a manlong at California prices.  Many became discouraged.  Others would takeoff their coats and look for a job, no matter what it might be.  Thesesucceeded as a rule. There were many young men who had studiedprofessions before they went to California, and who had never done aday's manual labor in their lives, who took in the situation at once andwent to work to make a start at anything they could get to do.  Somesupplied carpenters and masons with material--carrying plank, brick, ormortar, as the case might be; others drove stages, drays, or baggagewagons, until they could do better.  More became discouraged early andspent their time looking up people who would 'treat,' or lounging aboutrestaurants and gambling houses where free lunches were furnished daily.They were welcomed at these places because they often brought in minerswho proved good customers.My regiment spent a few weeks at Benicia barracks, and then was orderedto Fort Vancouver, on the Columbia River, then in Oregon Territory.During the winter of 1852-3 the territory was divided, all north of theColumbia River being taken from Oregon to make Washington Territory.Prices for all kinds of supplies were so high on the Pacific coast from1849 until at least 1853--that it would have been impossible forofficers of the army to exist upon their pay, if it had not been thatauthority was given them to purchase from the commissary such suppliesas he kept, at New Orleans wholesale prices.  A cook could not be hiredfor the pay of a captain.  The cook could do better.  At Benicia, in1852, flour was 25 cents per pound; potatoes were 16 cents; beets,turnips and cabbage, 6 cents; onions, 37 1/2 cents; meat and otherarticles in proportion.  In 1853 at Vancouver vegetables were a littlelower.  I with three other officers concluded that we would raise a cropfor ourselves, and by selling the surplus realize something handsome.  Ibought a pair of horses that had crossed the plains that summer and werevery poor.  They recuperated rapidly, however, and proved a good team tobreak up the ground with.  I performed all the labor of breaking up theground while the other officers planted the potatoes.  Our crop wasenormous.  Luckily for us the Columbia River rose to a great height fromthe melting of the snow in the mountains in June, and overflowed andkilled most of our crop.  This saved digging it up, for everybody on thePacific coast seemed to have come to the conclusion at the same timethat agriculture would be profitable.  In 1853 more than three-quartersof the potatoes raised were permitted to rot in the ground, or had to bethrown away.  The only potatoes we sold were to our own mess.While I was stationed on the Pacific coast we were free from Indianwars.  There were quite a number of remnants of tribes in the vicinityof Portland in Oregon, and of Fort Vancouver in Washington Territory.They had generally acquired some of the vices of civilization, but noneof the virtues, except in individual cases.  The Hudson's Bay Companyhad held the North-west with their trading posts for many years beforethe United States was represented on the Pacific coast.  They stillretained posts along the Columbia River and one at Fort Vancouver, whenI was there.  Their treatment of the Indians had brought out the betterqualities of the savages.  Farming had been undertaken by the company tosupply the Indians with bread and vegetables; they raised some cattleand horses; and they had now taught the Indians to do the labor of thefarm and herd. They always compensated them for their labor, and alwaysgave them goods of uniform quality and at uniform price.Before the advent of the American, the medium of exchange between theIndian and the white man was pelts.  Afterward it was silver coin.  Ifan Indian received in the sale of a horse a fifty dollar gold piece, notan infrequent occurrence, the first thing he did was to exchange it forAmerican half dollars. These he could count.  He would then commence hispurchases, paying for each article separately, as he got it.  He wouldnot trust any one to add up the bill and pay it all at once.  At thatday fifty dollar gold pieces, not the issue of the government, werecommon on the Pacific coast.  They were called slugs.The Indians, along the lower Columbia as far as the Cascades and on thelower Willamette, died off very fast during the year I spent in thatsection; for besides acquiring the vices of the white people they hadacquired also their diseases.  The measles and the small-pox were bothamazingly fatal.  In their wild state, before the appearance of thewhite man among them, the principal complaints they were subject to werethose produced by long involuntary fasting, violent exercise in pursuitof game, and over-eating.  Instinct more than reason had taught them aremedy for these ills.  It was the steam bath.  Something like abake-oven was built, large enough to admit a man lying down. Bushes werestuck in the ground in two rows, about six feet long and some two orthree feet apart; other bushes connected the rows at one end.  The topsof the bushes were drawn together to interlace, and confined in thatposition; the whole was then plastered over with wet clay until everyopening was filled. Just inside the open end of the oven the floor wasscooped out so as to make a hole that would hold a bucket or two ofwater. These ovens were always built on the banks of a stream, a bigspring, or pool of water.  When a patient required a bath, a fire wasbuilt near the oven and a pile of stones put upon it. The cavity at thefront was then filled with water.  When the stones were sufficientlyheated, the patient would draw himself into the oven; a blanket would bethrown over the open end, and hot stones put into the water until thepatient could stand it no longer.  He was then withdrawn from his steambath and doused into the cold stream near by.  This treatment may haveanswered with the early ailments of the Indians.  With the measles orsmall-pox it would kill every time.During my year on the Columbia River, the small-pox exterminated onesmall remnant of a band of Indians entirely, and reduced othersmaterially.  I do not think there was a case of recovery among them,until the doctor with the Hudson Bay Company took the matter in hand andestablished a hospital.  Nearly every case he treated recovered.  Inever, myself, saw the treatment described in the preceding paragraph,but have heard it described by persons who have witnessed it.  Thedecimation among the Indians I knew of personally, and the hospital,established for their benefit, was a Hudson's Bay building not a stone'sthrow from my own quarters.The death of Colonel Bliss, of the Adjutant General's department, whichoccurred July 5th, 1853, promoted me to the captaincy of a company thenstationed at Humboldt Bay, California.  The notice reached me inSeptember of the same year, and I very soon started to join my newcommand.  There was no way of reaching Humboldt at that time except totake passage on a San Francisco sailing vessel going after lumber.  Redwood, a species of cedar, which on the Pacific coast takes the placefilled by white pine in the East, then abounded on the banks of HumboldtBay.  There were extensive saw-mills engaged in preparing this lumberfor the San Francisco market, and sailing vessels, used in getting it tomarket, furnished the only means of communication between Humboldt andthe balance of the world.I was obliged to remain in San Francisco for several days before I founda vessel.  This gave me a good opportunity of comparing the SanFrancisco of 1852 with that of 1853.  As before stated, there had beenbut one wharf in front of the city in 1852--Long Wharf.  In 1853 thetown had grown out into the bay beyond what was the end of this wharfwhen I first saw it.  Streets and houses had been built out on pileswhere the year before the largest vessels visiting the port lay atanchor or tied to the wharf.  There was no filling under the streets orhouses.  San Francisco presented the same general appearance as the yearbefore; that is, eating, drinking and gambling houses were conspicuousfor their number and publicity.  They were on the first floor, withdoors wide open.  At all hours of the day and night in walking thestreets, the eye was regaled, on every block near the water front, bythe sight of players at faro. Often broken places were found in thestreet, large enough to let a man down into the water below.  I have butlittle doubt that many of the people who went to the Pacific coast inthe early days of the gold excitement, and have never been heard fromsince, or who were heard from for a time and then ceased to write, foundwatery graves beneath the houses or streets built over San FranciscoBay.Besides the gambling in cards there was gambling on a larger scale incity lots.  These were sold 'On Change,' much as stocks are now sold onWall Street.  Cash, at time of purchase, was always paid by the broker;but the purchaser had only to put up his margin.  He was charged at therate of two or three per cent. a month on the difference, besidescommissions.  The sand hills, some of them almost inaccessible tofoot-passengers, were surveyed off and mapped into fifty vara lots--avara being a Spanish yard.  These were sold at first at very low prices,but were sold and resold for higher prices until they went up to manythousands of dollars.  The brokers did a fine business, and so did manysuch purchasers as were sharp enough to quit purchasing before the finalcrash came.  As the city grew, the sand hills back of the town furnishedmaterial for filling up the bay under the houses and streets, and stillfurther out. The temporary houses, first built over the water in theharbor, soon gave way to more solid structures.  The main business partof the city now is on solid ground, made where vessels of the largestclass lay at anchor in the early days.  I was in San Francisco again in1854.  Gambling houses had disappeared from public view.  The city hadbecome staid and orderly.
ISFP	 XVI.RESIGNATION--PRIVATE LIFE--LIFE AT GALENA--THE COMING CRISIS.My family, all this while, was at the East.  It consisted now of a wifeand two children.  I saw no chance of supporting them on the Pacificcoast out of my pay as an army officer.  I concluded, therefore, toresign, and in March applied for a leave of absence until the end of theJuly following, tendering my resignation to take effect at the end ofthat time.  I left the Pacific coast very much attached to it, and withthe full expectation of making it my future home.  That expectation andthat hope remained uppermost in my mind until the Lieutenant-Generalcybill was introduced into Congress in the winter of 1863-4.  The passageof that bill, and my promotion, blasted my last hope of ever becoming acitizen of the further West.In the late summer of 1854 I rejoined my family, to find in it a sonwhom I had never seen, born while I was on the Isthmus of Panama.  I wasnow to commence, at the age of thirty-two, a new struggle for oursupport.  My wife had a farm near St. Louis, to which we went, but I hadno means to stock it.  A house had to be built also.  I worked veryhard, never losing a day because of bad weather, and accomplished theobject in a moderate way.  If nothing else could be done I would load acord of wood on a wagon and take it to the city for sale.  I managed tokeep along very well until 1858, when I was attacked by fever and ague.I had suffered very severely and for a long time from this disease,while a boy in Ohio.  It lasted now over a year, and, while it did notkeep me in the house, it did interfere greatly with the amount of work Iwas able to perform.  In the fall of 1858 I sold out my stock, crops andfarming utensils at auction, and gave up farming.In the winter I established a partnership with Harry Boggs, a cousin ofMrs.  Grant, in the real estate agency business.  I spent that winter atSt. Louis myself, but did not take my family into town until the spring.Our business might have become prosperous if I had been able to wait forit to grow.  As it was, there was no more than one person could attendto, and not enough to support two families.  While a citizen of St.Louis and engaged in the real estate agency business, I was a candidatefor the office of county engineer, an office of respectability andemolument which would have been very acceptable to me at that time.  Theincumbent was appointed by the county court, which consisted of fivemembers.  My opponent had the advantage of birth over me (he was acitizen by adoption) and carried off the prize.  I now withdrew from theco-partnership with Boggs, and, in May, 1860, removed to Galena,Illinois, and took a clerkship in my father's store.While a citizen of Missouri, my first opportunity for casting a vote ata Presidential election occurred.  I had been in the army from beforeattaining my majority and had thought but little about politics,although I was a Whig by education and a great admirer of Mr. Clay.  Butthe Whig party had ceased to exist before I had an opportunity ofexercising the privilege of casting a ballot; the Know-Nothing party hadtaken its place, but was on the wane; and the Republican party was in achaotic state and had not yet received a name.  It had no existence inthe Slave States except at points on the borders next to Free States.In St. Louis City and County, what afterwards became the Republicanparty was known as the Free-Soil Democracy, led by the Honorable FrankP. Blair.  Most of my neighbors had known me as an officer of the armywith Whig proclivities.  They had been on the same side, and, on thedeath of their party, many had become Know-Nothings, or members of theAmerican party. There was a lodge near my new home, and I was invited tojoin it.  I accepted the invitation; was initiated; attended a meetingjust one week later, and never went to another afterwards.I have no apologies to make for having been one week a member of theAmerican party; for I still think native-born citizens of the UnitedStates should have as much protection, as many privileges in theirnative country, as those who voluntarily select it for a home.  But allsecret, oath-bound political parties are dangerous to any nation, nomatter how pure or how patriotic the motives and principles which firstbring them together.  No political party can or ought to exist when oneof its corner-stones is opposition to freedom of thought and to theright to worship God 'according to the dictate of one's own conscience,'or according to the creed of any religious denomination whatever.Nevertheless, if a sect sets up its laws as binding above the Statelaws, wherever the two come in conflict this claim must be resisted andsuppressed at whatever cost.Up to the Mexican war there were a few out and out abolitionists, menwho carried their hostility to slavery into all elections, from thosefor a justice of the peace up to the Presidency of the United States.They were noisy but not numerous.  But the great majority of people atthe North, where slavery did not exist, were opposed to the institution,and looked upon its existence in any part of the country as unfortunate.They did not hold the States where slavery existed responsible for it;and believed that protection should be given to the right of property inslaves until some satisfactory way could be reached to be rid of theinstitution.  Opposition to slavery was not a creed of either politicalparty.  In some sections more anti-slavery men belonged to theDemocratic party, and in others to the Whigs.  But with the inaugurationof the Mexican war, in fact with the annexation of Texas, 'theinevitable conflict' commenced.As the time for the Presidential election of 1856--the first at which Ihad the opportunity of voting--approached, party feeling began to runhigh.  The Republican party was regarded in the South and the borderStates not only as opposed to the extension of slavery, but as favoringthe compulsory abolition of the institution without compensation to theowners.  The most horrible visions seemed to present themselves to theminds of people who, one would suppose, ought to have known better.Many educated and, otherwise, sensible persons appeared to believe thatemancipation meant social equality.  Treason to the Government wasopenly advocated and was not rebuked.  It was evident to my mind thatthe election of a Republican President in 1856 meant the secession ofall the Slave States, and rebellion.  Under these circumstances Ipreferred the success of a candidate whose election would prevent orpostpone secession, to seeing the country plunged into a war the end ofwhich no man could foretell.  With a Democrat elected by the unanimousvote of the Slave States, there could be no pretext for secession forfour years.  I very much hoped that the passions of the people wouldsubside in that time, and the catastrophe be averted altogether; if itwas not, I believed the country would be better prepared to receive theshock and to resist it.  I therefore voted for James Buchanan forPresident.  Four years later the Republican party was successful inelecting its candidate to the Presidency.  The civilized world haslearned the consequence.  Four millions of human beings held as chattelshave been liberated; the ballot has been given to them; the free schoolsof the country have been opened to their children.  The nation stilllives, and the people are just as free to avoid social intimacy with theblacks as ever they were, or as they are with white people.While living in Galena I was nominally only a clerk supporting myselfand family on a stipulated salary.  In reality my position wasdifferent.  My father had never lived in Galena himself, but hadestablished my two brothers there, the one next younger than myself incharge of the business, assisted by the youngest.  When I went there itwas my father's intention to give up all connection with the businesshimself, and to establish his three sons in it:  but the brother who hadreally built up the business was sinking with consumption, and it wasnot thought best to make any change while he was in this condition.  Helived until September, 1861, when he succumbed to that insidious diseasewhich always flatters its victims into the belief that they are growingbetter up to the close of life.  A more honorable man never transactedbusiness.  In September, 1861, I was engaged in an employment whichrequired all my attention elsewhere.During the eleven months that I lived in Galena prior to the first callfor volunteers, I had been strictly attentive to my business, and hadmade but few acquaintances other than customers and people engaged inthe same line with myself.  When the election took place in November,1860, I had not been a resident of Illinois long enough to gaincitizenship and could not, therefore, vote.  I was really glad of thisat the time, for my pledges would have compelled me to vote for StephenA. Douglas, who had no possible chance of election.  The contest wasreally between Mr. Breckinridge and Mr. Lincoln; between minority ruleand rule by the majority.  I wanted, as between these candidates, to seeMr. Lincoln elected.  Excitement ran high during the canvass, andtorch-light processions enlivened the scene in the generally quietstreets of Galena many nights during the campaign.  I did not paradewith either party, but occasionally met with the 'wide awakes'--Republicans--in their rooms, and superintended their drill.  It wasevident, from the time of the Chicago nomination to the close of thecanvass, that the election of the Republican candidate would be thesignal for some of the Southern States to secede.  I still had hopesthat the four years which had elapsed since the first nomination of aPresidential candidate by a party distinctly opposed to slaveryextension, had given time for the extreme pro-slavery sentiment to cooldown; for the Southerners to think well before they took the awful leapwhich they had so vehemently threatened.  But I was mistaken.The Republican candidate was elected, and solid substantial people ofthe North-west, and I presume the same order of people throughout theentire North, felt very serious, but determined, after this event.  Itwas very much discussed whether the South would carry out its threat tosecede and set up a separate government, the corner-stone of whichshould be, protection to the 'Divine' institution of slavery.  For therewere people who believed in the 'divinity' of human slavery, as thereare now people who believe Mormonism and Polygamy to be ordained by theMost High.  We forgive them for entertaining such notions, but forbidtheir practice.  It was generally believed that there would be a flurry;that some of the extreme Southern States would go so far as to passordinances of secession.  But the common impression was that this stepwas so plainly suicidal for the South, that the movement would notspread over much of the territory and would not last long.Doubtless the founders of our government, the majority of them at least,regarded the confederation of the colonies as an experiment.  Eachcolony considered itself a separate government; that the confederationwas for mutual protection against a foreign foe, and the prevention ofstrife and war among themselves.  If there had been a desire on the partof any single State to withdraw from the compact at any time while thenumber of States was limited to the original thirteen, I do not supposethere would have been any to contest the right, no matter how much thedetermination might have been regretted. The problem changed on theratification of the Constitution by all the colonies; it changed stillmore when amendments were added; and if the right of any one State towithdraw continued to exist at all after the ratification of theConstitution, it certainly ceased on the formation of new States, atleast so far as the new States themselves were concerned.  It was neverpossessed at all by Florida or the States west of the Mississippi, allof which were purchased by the treasury of the entire nation. Texas andthe territory brought into the Union in consequence of annexation, werepurchased with both blood and treasure; and Texas, with a domain greaterthan that of any European state except Russia, was permitted to retainas state property all the public lands within its borders.  It wouldhave been ingratitude and injustice of the most flagrant sort for thisState to withdraw from the Union after all that had been spent and doneto introduce her; yet, if separation had actually occurred, Texas mustnecessarily have gone with the South, both on account of herinstitutions and her geographical position. Secession was illogical aswell as impracticable; it was revolution.Now, the right of revolution is an inherent one.  When people areoppressed by their government, it is a natural right they enjoy torelieve themselves of the oppression, if they are strong enough, eitherby withdrawal from it, or by overthrowing it and substituting agovernment more acceptable.  But any people or part of a people whoresort to this remedy, stake their lives, their property, and everyclaim for protection given by citizenship--on the issue.  Victory, orthe conditions imposed by the conqueror--must be the result.In the case of the war between the States it would have been the exacttruth if the South had said,--'We do not want to live with you Northernpeople any longer; we know our institution of slavery is obnoxious toyou, and, as you are growing numerically stronger than we, it may atsome time in the future be endangered.  So long as you permitted us tocontrol the government, and with the aid of a few friends at the Northto enact laws constituting your section a guard against the escape ofour property, we were willing to live with you.  You have beensubmissive to our rule heretofore; but it looks now as if you did notintend to continue so, and we will remain in the Union no longer.'Instead of this the seceding States cried lustily,--'Let us alone; youhave no constitutional power to interfere with us.'  Newspapers andpeople at the North reiterated the cry.  Individuals might ignore theconstitution; but the Nation itself must not only obey it, but mustenforce the strictest construction of that instrument; the constructionput upon it by the Southerners themselves.  The fact is the constitutiondid not apply to any such contingency as the one existing from 1861 to1865.  Its framers never dreamed of such a contingency occurring.  Ifthey had foreseen it, the probabilities are they would have sanctionedthe right of a State or States to withdraw rather than that there shouldbe war between brothers.The framers were wise in their generation and wanted to do the very bESTJossible to secure their own liberty and independence, and that also oftheir descendants to the latest days.  It is preposterous to supposethat the people of one generation can lay down the best and only rulesof government for all who are to come after them, and under unforeseencontingencies.  At the time of the framing of our constitution the onlyphysical forces that had been subdued and made to serve man and do hislabor, were the currents in the streams and in the air we breathe. Rudemachinery, propelled by water power, had been invented; sails to propelships upon the waters had been set to catch the passing breeze--but theapplication of stream to propel vessels against both wind and current,and machinery to do all manner of work had not been thought of.  Theinstantaneous transmission of messages around the world by means ofelectricity would probably at that day have been attributed towitchcraft or a league with the Devil.  Immaterial circumstances hadchanged as greatly as material ones.  We could not and ought not to berigidly bound by the rules laid down under circumstances so differentfor emergencies so utterly unanticipated.  The fathers themselves wouldhave been the first to declare that their prerogatives were notirrevocable.  They would surely have resisted secession could they havelived to see the shape it assumed.I travelled through the Northwest considerably during the winter of1860-1.  We had customers in all the little towns in south-westWisconsin, south-east Minnesota and north-east Iowa.  These generallyknew I had been a captain in the regular army and had served through theMexican war.  Consequently wherever I stopped at night, some of thepeople would come to the public-house where I was, and sit till a latehour discussing the probabilities of the future.  My own views at thattime were like those officially expressed by Mr. Seward at a later day,that 'the war would be over in ninety days.'  I continued to entertainthese views until after the battle of Shiloh.  I believe now that therewould have been no more battles at the West after the capture of FortDonelson if all the troops in that region had been under a singlecommander who would have followed up that victory.There is little doubt in my mind now that the prevailing sentiment ofthe South would have been opposed to secession in 1860 and 1861, ifthere had been a fair and calm expression of opinion, unbiased bythreats, and if the ballot of one legal voter had counted for as much asthat of any other.  But there was no calm discussion of the question.Demagogues who were too old to enter the army if there should be a war,others who entertained so high an opinion of their own ability that theydid not believe they could be spared from the direction of the affairsof state in such an event, declaimed vehemently and unceasingly againstthe North; against its aggressions upon the South; its interference withSouthern rights, etc., etc.  They denounced the Northerners as cowards,poltroons, negro-worshippers; claimed that one Southern man was equal tofive Northern men in battle; that if the South would stand up for itsrights the North would back down.  Mr. Jefferson Davis said in a speech,delivered at La Grange, Mississippi, before the secession of that State,that he would agree to drink all the blood spilled south of Mason andDixon's line if there should be a war.  The young men who would have thefighting to do in case of war, believed all these statements, both inregard to the aggressiveness of the North and its cowardice.  They, too,cried out for a separation from such people.  The great bulk of thelegal voters of the South were men who owned no slaves; their homes weregenerally in the hills and poor country; their facilities for educatingtheir children, even up to the point of reading and writing, were verylimited; their interest in the contest was very meagre--what there was,if they had been capable of seeing it, was with the North; they tooneeded emancipation.  Under the old regime they were looked down upon bythose who controlled all the affairs in the interest of slave-owners, aspoor white trash who were allowed the ballot so long as they cast itaccording to direction.I am aware that this last statement may be disputed and individualtestimony perhaps adduced to show that in ante-bellum days the ballotwas as untrammelled in the south as in any section of the country; butin the face of any such contradiction I reassert the statement.  Theshot-gun was not resorted to.  Masked men did not ride over the countryat night intimidating voters; but there was a firm feeling that a classexisted in every State with a sort of divine right to control publicaffairs.  If they could not get this control by one means they must byanother.  The end justified the means.  The coercion, if mild, wascomplete.There were two political parties, it is true, in all the States, bothstrong in numbers and respectability, but both equally loyal to theinstitution which stood paramount in Southern eyes to all otherinstitutions in state or nation.  The slave-owners were the minority,but governed both parties.  Had politics ever divided the slave-holdersand the non-slave-holders, the majority would have been obliged toyield, or internecine war would have been the consequence.  I do notknow that the Southern people were to blame for this condition ofaffairs. There was a time when slavery was not profitable, and thediscussion of the merits of the institution was confined almostexclusively to the territory where it existed.  The States of Virginiaand Kentucky came near abolishing slavery by their own acts, one Statedefeating the measure by a tie vote and the other only lacking one.  Butwhen the institution became profitable, all talk of its abolition ceasedwhere it existed; and naturally, as human nature is constituted,arguments were adduced in its support.  The cotton-gin probably had muchto do with the justification of slavery.The winter of 1860-1 will be remembered by middle-aged people of to-dayas one of great excitement.  South Carolina promptly seceded after theresult of the Presidential election was known.  Other Southern Statesproposed to follow.  In some of them the Union sentiment was so strongthat it had to be suppressed by force.  Maryland, Delaware, Kentucky andMissouri, all Slave States, failed to pass ordinances of secession; butthey were all represented in the so-called congress of the so-calledConfederate States.  The Governor and Lieutenant-Governor of Missouri,in 1861, Jackson and Reynolds, were both supporters of the rebellion andtook refuge with the enemy.  The governor soon died, and thelieutenant-governor assumed his office; issued proclamations as governorof the State; was recognized as such by the Confederate Government, andcontinued his pretensions until the collapse of the rebellion. The Southclaimed the sovereignty of States, but claimed the right to coerce intotheir confederation such States as they wanted, that is, all the Stateswhere slavery existed.  They did not seem to think this courseinconsistent.  The fact is, the Southern slave-owners believed that, insome way, the ownership of slaves conferred a sort of patent ofnobility--a right to govern independent of the interest or wishes ofthose who did not hold such property.  They convinced themselves, first,of the divine origin of the institution and, next, that that particularinstitution was not safe in the hands of any body of legislators butthemselves.Meanwhile the Administration of President Buchanan looked helplessly onand proclaimed that the general government had no power to interfere;that the Nation had no power to save its own life.  Mr. Buchanan had inhis cabinet two members at least, who were as earnest--to use a mildterm--in the cause of secession as Mr. Davis or any Southern statesman.One of them, Floyd, the Secretary of War, scattered the army so thatmuch of it could be captured when hostilities should commence, anddistributed the cannon and small arms from Northern arsenals throughoutthe South so as to be on hand when treason wanted them.  The navy wasscattered in like manner.  The President did not prevent his cabinetpreparing for war upon their government, either by destroying itsresources or storing them in the South until a de facto government wasestablished with Jefferson Davis as its President, and Montgomery,Alabama, as the Capital.  The secessionists had then to leave thecabinet.  In their own estimation they were aliens in the country whichhad given them birth.  Loyal men were put into their places.  Treason inthe executive branch of the government was estopped.  But the harm hadalready been done.  The stable door was locked after the horse had beenstolen.During all of the trying winter of 1860-1, when the Southerners were sodefiant that they would not allow within their borders the expression ofa sentiment hostile to their views, it was a brave man indeed who couldstand up and proclaim his loyalty to the Union.  On the other hand menat the North--prominent men--proclaimed that the government had no powerto coerce the South into submission to the laws of the land; that if theNorth undertook to raise armies to go south, these armies would have tomarch over the dead bodies of the speakers.  A portion of the press ofthe North was constantly proclaiming similar views. When the timearrived for the President-elect to go to the capital of the Nation to besworn into office, it was deemed unsafe for him to travel, not only as aPresident-elect, but as any private citizen should be allowed to do.Instead of going in a special car, receiving the good wishes of hisconstituents at all the stations along the road, he was obliged to stopon the way and to be smuggled into the capital.  He disappeared frompublic view on his journey, and the next the country knew, his arrivalwas announced at the capital.  There is little doubt that he would havebeen assassinated if he had attempted to travel openly throughout hisjourney.
ISFP	 XVII.OUTBREAK OF THE REBELLION--PRESIDING AT A UNION MEETING--MUSTERINGOFFICER OF STATE TROOPS--LYON AT CAMP JACKSON--SERVICES TENDERED TO THEGOVERNMENT.The 4th of March, 1861, came, and Abraham Lincoln was sworn to maintainthe Union against all its enemies.  The secession of one State afteranother followed, until eleven had gone out.  On the 11th of April FortSumter, a National fort in the harbor of Charleston, South Carolina, wasfired upon by the Southerners and a few days after was captured.  TheConfederates proclaimed themselves aliens, and thereby debarredthemselves of all right to claim protection under the Constitution ofthe United States.  We did not admit the fact that they were aliens, butall the same, they debarred themselves of the right to expect bettertreatment than people of any other foreign state who make war upon anindependent nation.  Upon the firing on Sumter President Lincoln issuedhis first call for troops and soon after a proclamation conveningCongress in extra session.  The call was for 75,000 volunteers forninety days' service.  If the shot fired at Fort Sumter 'was heardaround the world,' the call of the President for 75,000 men was heardthroughout the Northern States.  There was not a state in the North of amillion of inhabitants that would not have furnished the entire numberfaster than arms could have been supplied to them, if it had beennecessary.As soon as the news of the call for volunteers reached Galena, posterswere stuck up calling for a meeting of the citizens at the court-housein the evening.  Business ceased entirely; all was excitement; for atime there were no party distinctions; all were Union men, determined toavenge the insult to the national flag.  In the evening the court-housewas packed.  Although a comparative stranger I was called upon topreside; the sole reason, possibly, was that I had been in the army andhad seen service.  With much embarrassment and some prompting I made outto announce the object of the meeting.  Speeches were in order, but itis doubtful whether it would have been safe just then to make other thanpatriotic ones.  There was probably no one in the house, however, whofelt like making any other.  The two principal speeches were by B. B.Howard, the post-master and a Breckinridge Democrat at the Novemberelection the fall before, and John A. Rawlins, an elector on the Douglasticket.  E. B. Washburne, with whom I was not acquainted at that time,came in after the meeting had been organized, and expressed, Iunderstood afterwards, a little surprise that Galena could not furnish apresiding officer for such an occasion without taking a stranger.  Hecame forward and was introduced, and made a speech appealing to thepatriotism of the meeting.After the speaking was over volunteers were called for to form acompany.  The quota of Illinois had been fixed at six regiments; and itwas supposed that one company would be as much as would be accepted fromGalena.  The company was raised and the officers and non-commissionedofficers elected before the meeting adjourned.  I declined the captaincybefore the balloting, but announced that I would aid the company inevery way I could and would be found in the service in some position ifthere should be a war.  I never went into our leather store after thatmeeting, to put up a package or do other business.The ladies of Galena were quite as patriotic as the men.  They could notenlist, but they conceived the idea of sending their first company tothe field uniformed.  They came to me to get a description of the UnitedStates uniform for infantry; subscribed and bought the material;procured tailors to cut out the garments, and the ladies made them up.In a few days the company was in uniform and ready to report at theState capital for assignment.  The men all turned out the morning aftertheir enlistment, and I took charge, divided them into squads andsuperintended their drill.  When they were ready to go to Springfield Iwent with them and remained there until they were assigned to aregiment.There were so many more volunteers than had been called for that thequestion whom to accept was quite embarrassing to the governor, RichardYates.  The legislature was in session at the time, however, and came tohis relief.  A law was enacted authorizing the governor to accept theservices of ten additional regiments, one from each congressionaldistrict, for one month, to be paid by the State, but pledged to go intothe service of the United States if there should be a further callduring their term.  Even with this relief the governor was still verymuch embarrassed.  Before the war was over he was like the Presidentwhen he was taken with the varioloid:  'at last he had something hecould give to all who wanted it.'In time the Galena company was mustered into the United States service,forming a part of the 11th Illinois volunteer infantry.  My duties, Ithought, had ended at Springfield, and I was prepared to start home bythe evening train, leaving at nine o'clock.  Up to that time I do notthink I had been introduced to Governor Yates, or had ever spoken tohim.  I knew him by sight, however, because he was living at the samehotel and I often saw him at table.  The evening I was to quit thecapital I left the supper room before the governor and was standing atthe front door when he came out.  He spoke to me, calling me by my oldarmy title 'Captain,' and said he understood that I was about leavingthe city.  I answered that I was.  He said he would be glad if I wouldremain over-night and call at the Executive office the next morning.I complied with his request, and was asked to go into theAdjutant-General's office and render such assistance as I could, thegovernor saying that my army experience would be of great service there.I accepted the proposition.My old army experience I found indeed of very great service.  I was noclerk, nor had I any capacity to become one.  The only place I everfound in my life to put a paper so as to find it again was either a sidecoat-pocket or the hands of a clerk or secretary more careful thanmyself.  But I had been quartermaster, commissary and adjutant in thefield.  The army forms were familiar to me and I could direct how theyshould be made out.  There was a clerk in the office of theAdjutant-General who supplied my deficiencies.  The ease with which theState of Illinois settled its accounts with the government at the closeof the war is evidence of the efficiency of Mr. Loomis as an accountanton a large scale.  He remained in the office until that time.As I have stated, the legislature authorized the governor to accept theservices of ten additional regiments.  I had charge of mustering theseregiments into the State service.  They were assembled at the mostconvenient railroad centres in their respective congressional districts.I detailed officers to muster in a portion of them, but mustered threein the southern part of the State myself.  One of these was to assembleat Belleville, some eighteen miles south-east of St. Louis.  When I gotthere I found that only one or two companies had arrived. There was noprobability of the regiment coming together under five days.  This gaveme a few idle days which I concluded to spend in St. Louis.There was a considerable force of State militia at Camp Jackson, on theoutskirts of St. Louis, at the time.  There is but little doubt that itwas the design of Governor Claiborn Jackson to have these troops readyto seize the United States arsenal and the city of St. Louis.  Why theydid not do so I do not know. There was but a small garrison, twocompanies I think, under Captain N. Lyon at the arsenal, and but for thetimely services of the Hon. F. P. Blair, I have little doubt that St.Louis would have gone into rebel hands, and with it the arsenal with allits arms and ammunition.Blair was a leader among the Union men of St. Louis in 1861. There wasno State government in Missouri at the time that would sanction theraising of troops or commissioned officers to protect United Statesproperty, but Blair had probably procured some form of authority fromthe President to raise troops in Missouri and to muster them into theservice of the United States.  At all events, he did raise a regimentand took command himself as Colonel.  With this force he reported toCaptain Lyon and placed himself and regiment under his orders.  It waswhispered that Lyon thus reinforced intended to break up Camp Jacksonand capture the militia.  I went down to the arsenal in the morning tosee the troops start out.  I had known Lyon for two years at West Pointand in the old army afterwards.  Blair I knew very well by sight.  I hadheard him speak in the canvass of 1858, possibly several times, but Ihad never spoken to him.  As the troops marched out of the enclosurearound the arsenal, Blair was on his horse outside forming them intoline preparatory to their march.  I introduced myself to him and had afew moments' conversation and expressed my sympathy with his purpose.This was my first personal acquaintance with the Honorable--afterwardsMajor-General F. P. Blair.  Camp Jackson surrendered without a fight andthe garrison was marched down to the arsenal as prisoners of war.Up to this time the enemies of the government in St. Louis had been boldand defiant, while Union men were quiet but determined.  The enemies hadtheir head-quarters in a central and public position on Pine Street,near Fifth--from which the rebel flag was flaunted boldly.  The Unionmen had a place of meeting somewhere in the city, I did not know where,and I doubt whether they dared to enrage the enemies of the governmentby placing the national flag outside their head-quarters.  As soon asthe news of the capture of Camp Jackson reached the city the conditionof affairs was changed.  Union men became rampant, aggressive, and, ifyou will, intolerant.  They proclaimed their sentiments boldly, and wereimpatient at anything like disrespect for the Union.  The secessionistsbecame quiet but were filled with suppressed rage.  They had beenplaying the bully.  The Union men ordered the rebel flag taken down fromthe building on Pine Street.  The command was given in tones ofauthority and it was taken down, never to be raised again in St. Louis.I witnessed the scene.  I had heard of the surrender of the camp andthat the garrison was on its way to the arsenal.  I had seen the troopsstart out in the morning and had wished them success.  I now determinedto go to the arsenal and await their arrival and congratulate them.  Istepped on a car standing at the corner of 4th and Pine streets, and sawa crowd of people standing quietly in front of the head-quarters, whowere there for the purpose of hauling down the flag.  There were squadsof other people at intervals down the street.  They too were quiet butfilled with suppressed rage, and muttered their resentment at the insultto, what they called, 'their' flag.  Before the car I was in hadstarted, a dapper little fellow--he would be called a dude at this day--stepped in.  He was in a great state of excitement and used adjectivesfreely to express his contempt for the Union and for those who had justperpetrated such an outrage upon the rights of a free people.  There wasonly one other passenger in the car besides myself when this young manentered.  He evidently expected to find nothing but sympathy when he gotaway from the 'mud sills' engaged in compelling a 'free people' to pulldown a flag they adored.  He turned to me saying:  'Things have come toa ---- pretty pass when a free people can't choose their own flag.Where I came from if a man dares to say a word in favor of the Union wehang him to a limb of the first tree we come to.'  I replied that 'afterall we were not so intolerant in St. Louis as we might be; I had notseen a single rebel hung yet, nor heard of one; there were plenty ofthem who ought to be, however.'  The young man subsided.  He was socrestfallen that I believe if I had ordered him to leave the car hewould have gone quietly out, saying to himself:  'More Yankeeoppression.'By nightfall the late defenders of Camp Jackson were all within thewalls of the St. Louis arsenal, prisoners of war.  The next day I leftSt. Louis for Mattoon, Illinois, where I was to muster in the regimentfrom that congressional district.  This was the 21st Illinois infantry,the regiment of which I subsequently became colonel.  I mustered oneregiment afterwards, when my services for the State were about closed.Brigadier-General John Pope was stationed at Springfield, as UnitedStates mustering officer, all the time I was in the State service.  Hewas a native of Illinois and well acquainted with most of the prominentmen in the State.  I was a carpet-bagger and knew but few of them.While I was on duty at Springfield the senators, representatives inCongress, ax-governors and the State legislators were nearly all at theState capital.  The only acquaintance I made among them was with thegovernor, whom I was serving, and, by chance, with Senator S. A.Douglas.  The only members of Congress I knew were Washburne and PhilipFoulk.  With the former, though he represented my district and we werecitizens of the same town, I only became acquainted at the meeting whenthe first company of Galena volunteers was raised.  Foulk I had known inSt. Louis when I was a citizen of that city.  I had been three years atWest Point with Pope and had served with him a short time during theMexican war, under General Taylor.  I saw a good deal of him during myservice with the State.  On one occasion he said to me that I ought togo into the United States service.  I told him I intended to do so ifthere was a war.  He spoke of his acquaintance with the public men ofthe State, and said he could get them to recommend me for a position andthat he would do all he could for me.  I declined to receive endorsementfor permission to fight for my country.Going home for a day or two soon after this conversation with GeneralPope, I wrote from Galena the following letter to the Adjutant-Generalof the Army.GALENA, ILLINOIS, May 24, 1861.COL. L. THOMAS Adjt.  Gen.  U. S. A., Washington, D. C.SIR:--Having served for fifteen years in the regular army, includingfour years at West Point, and feeling it the duty of every one who hasbeen educated at the Government expense to offer their services for thesupport of that Government, I have the honor, very respectfully, totender my services, until the close of the war, in such capacity as maybe offered.  I would say, in view of my present age and length ofservice, I feel myself competent to command a regiment, if thePresident, in his judgment, should see fit to intrust one to me.Since the first call of the President I have been serving on the staffof the Governor of this State, rendering such aid as I could in theorganization of our State militia, and am still engaged in thatcapacity.  A letter addressed to me at Springfield, Illinois, will reachme.I am very respectfully, Your obt. svt., U. S. GRANT.This letter failed to elicit an answer from the Adjutant-General of theArmy.  I presume it was hardly read by him, and certainly it could nothave been submitted to higher authority. Subsequent to the war GeneralBadeau having heard of this letter applied to the War Department for acopy of it.  The letter could not be found and no one recollected everhaving seen it.  I took no copy when it was written.  Long after theapplication of General Badeau, General Townsend, who had becomeAdjutant-General of the Army, while packing up papers preparatory to theremoval of his office, found this letter in some out-of-the-way place.It had not been destroyed, but it had not been regularly filed away.I felt some hesitation in suggesting rank as high as the colonelcy of aregiment, feeling somewhat doubtful whether I would be equal to theposition.  But I had seen nearly every colonel who had been mustered infrom the State of Illinois, and some from Indiana, and felt that if theycould command a regiment properly, and with credit, I could also.Having but little to do after the muster of the last of the regimentsauthorized by the State legislature, I asked and obtained of thegovernor leave of absence for a week to visit my parents in Covington,Kentucky, immediately opposite Cincinnati.  General McClellan had beenmade a major-general and had his headquarters at Cincinnati.  In realityI wanted to see him.  I had known him slightly at West Point, where weserved one year together, and in the Mexican war.  I was in hopes thatwhen he saw me he would offer me a position on his staff.  I called ontwo successive days at his office but failed to see him on eitheroccasion, and returned to Springfield.
ISFP	 XVIII.APPOINTED COLONEL OF THE 21ST ILLINOIS--PERSONNEL OF THE REGIMENT--GENERAL LOGAN--MARCH TO MISSOURI--MOVEMENT AGAINST HARRIS AT FLORIDA,MO.--GENERAL POPE IN COMMAND--STATIONED AT MEXICO, MO.While I was absent from the State capital on this occasion thePresident's second call for troops was issued.  This time it was for300,000 men, for three years or the war.  This brought into the UnitedStates service all the regiments then in the State service.  These hadelected their officers from highest to lowest and were accepted withtheir organizations as they were, except in two instances.  A Chicagoregiment, the 19th infantry, had elected a very young man to thecolonelcy.  When it came to taking the field the regiment asked to haveanother appointed colonel and the one they had previously chosen madelieutenant-colonel.  The 21st regiment of infantry, mustered in by me atMattoon, refused to go into the service with the colonel of theirselection in any position.  While I was still absent Governor Yatesappointed me colonel of this latter regiment.  A few days after I was incharge of it and in camp on the fair grounds near Springfield.My regiment was composed in large part of young men of as good socialposition as any in their section of the State.  It embraced the sons offarmers, lawyers, physicians, politicians, merchants, bankers andministers, and some men of maturer years who had filled such positionsthemselves.  There were also men in it who could be led astray; and thecolonel, elected by the votes of the regiment, had proved to be fullycapable of developing all there was in his men of recklessness.  It wassaid that he even went so far at times as to take the guard from theirposts and go with them to the village near by and make a night of it.When there came a prospect of battle the regiment wanted to have someone else to lead them.  I found it very hard work for a few days tobring all the men into anything like subordination; but the greatmajority favored discipline, and by the application of a little regulararmy punishment all were reduced to as good discipline as one could ask.The ten regiments which had volunteered in the State service for thirtydays, it will be remembered, had done so with a pledge to go into theNational service if called upon within that time. When they volunteeredthe government had only called for ninety days' enlistments.  Men werecalled now for three years or the war.  They felt that this change ofperiod released them from the obligation of re-volunteering.  When I wasappointed colonel, the 21st regiment was still in the State service.About the time they were to be mustered into the United States service,such of them as would go, two members of Congress from the State,McClernand and Logan, appeared at the capital and I was introduced tothem.  I had never seen either of them before, but I had read a greatdeal about them, and particularly about Logan, in the newspapers.  Bothwere democratic members of Congress, and Logan had been elected from thesouthern district of the State, where he had a majority of eighteenthousand over his Republican competitor.  His district had been settledoriginally by people from the Southern States, and at the breaking outof secession they sympathized with the South.  At the first outbreak ofwar some of them joined the Southern army; many others were preparing todo so; others rode over the country at night denouncing the Union, andmade it as necessary to guard railroad bridges over which Nationaltroops had to pass in southern Illinois, as it was in Kentucky or any ofthe border slave states.  Logan's popularity in this district wasunbounded.  He knew almost enough of the people in it by their Christiannames, to form an ordinary congressional district.  As he went inpolitics, so his district was sure to go.  The Republican papers hadbeen demanding that he should announce where he stood on the questionswhich at that time engrossed the whole of public thought.  Some werevery bitter in their denunciations of his silence.  Logan was not a manto be coerced into an utterance by threats.  He did, however, come outin a speech before the adjournment of the special session of Congresswhich was convened by the President soon after his inauguration, andannounced his undying loyalty and devotion to the Union. But I had nothappened to see that speech, so that when I first met Logan myimpressions were those formed from reading denunciations of him.McClernand, on the other hand, had early taken strong grounds for themaintenance of the Union and had been praised accordingly by theRepublican papers.  The gentlemen who presented these two members ofCongress asked me if I would have any objections to their addressing myregiment.  I hesitated a little before answering.  It was but a few daysbefore the time set for mustering into the United States service such ofthe men as were willing to volunteer for three years or the war.  I hadsome doubt as to the effect a speech from Logan might have; but as hewas with McClernand, whose sentiments on the all-absorbing questions ofthe day were well known, I gave my consent.  McClernand spoke first; andLogan followed in a speech which he has hardly equalled since for forceand eloquence.  It breathed a loyalty and devotion to the Union whichinspired my men to such a point that they would have volunteered toremain in the army as long as an enemy of the country continued to beararms against it.  They entered the United States service almost to aman.General Logan went to his part of the State and gave his attention toraising troops.  The very men who at first made it necessary to guardthe roads in southern Illinois became the defenders of the Union.  Loganentered the service himself as colonel of a regiment and rapidly rose tothe rank of major-general.  His district, which had promised at first togive much trouble to the government, filled every call made upon it fortroops, without resorting to the draft.  There was no call made whenthere were not more volunteers than were asked for. That congressionaldistrict stands credited at the War Department to-day with furnishingmore men for the army than it was called on to supply.I remained in Springfield with my regiment until the 3d of July, when Iwas ordered to Quincy, Illinois.  By that time the regiment was in agood state of discipline and the officers and men were well up in thecompany drill.  There was direct railroad communication betweenSpringfield and Quincy, but I thought it would be good preparation forthe troops to march there.  We had no transportation for our camp andgarrison equipage, so wagons were hired for the occasion and on the 3dof July we started.  There was no hurry, but fair marches were madeevery day until the Illinois River was crossed.  There I was overtakenby a dispatch saying that the destination of the regiment had beenchanged to Ironton, Missouri, and ordering me to halt where I was andawait the arrival of a steamer which had been dispatched up the IllinoisRiver to take the regiment to St. Louis.  The boat, when it did come,grounded on a sand-bar a few miles below where we were in camp.  Weremained there several days waiting to have the boat get off the bar,but before this occurred news came that an Illinois regiment wassurrounded by rebels at a point on the Hannibal and St. Joe Railroadsome miles west of Palmyra, in Missouri, and I was ordered to proceedwith all dispatch to their relief.  We took the cars and reached Quincyin a few hours.When I left Galena for the last time to take command of the 21stregiment I took with me my oldest son, Frederick D. Grant, then a lad ofeleven years of age.  On receiving the order to take rail for Quincy Iwrote to Mrs. Grant, to relieve what I supposed would be her greatanxiety for one so young going into danger, that I would send Fred homefrom Quincy by river.  I received a prompt letter in reply decidedlydisapproving my proposition, and urging that the lad should be allowedto accompany me.  It came too late.  Fred was already on his way up theMississippi bound for Dubuque, Iowa, from which place there was arailroad to Galena.My sensations as we approached what I supposed might be 'a field ofbattle' were anything but agreeable.  I had been in all the engagementsin Mexico that it was possible for one person to be in; but not incommand.  If some one else had been colonel and I had beenlieutenant-colonel I do not think I would have felt any trepidation.Before we were prepared to cross the Mississippi River at Quincy myanxiety was relieved; for the men of the besieged regiment camestraggling into town.  I am inclined to think both sides got frightenedand ran away.I took my regiment to Palmyra and remained there for a few days, untilrelieved by the 19th Illinois infantry.  From Palmyra I proceeded toSalt River, the railroad bridge over which had been destroyed by theenemy.  Colonel John M. Palmer at that time commanded the 13th Illinois,which was acting as a guard to workmen who were engaged in rebuildingthis bridge.  Palmer was my senior and commanded the two regiments aslong as we remained together.  The bridge was finished in about twoweeks, and I received orders to move against Colonel Thomas Harris, whowas said to be encamped at the little town of Florida, some twenty-fivemiles south of where we then were.At the time of which I now write we had no transportation and thecountry about Salt River was sparsely settled, so that it took some daysto collect teams and drivers enough to move the camp and garrisonequipage of a regiment nearly a thousand strong, together with a week'ssupply of provision and some ammunition.  While preparations for themove were going on I felt quite comfortable; but when we got on the roadand found every house deserted I was anything but easy.  In thetwenty-five miles we had to march we did not see a person, old or young,male or female, except two horsemen who were on a road that crossedours.  As soon as they saw us they decamped as fast as their horsescould carry them.  I kept my men in the ranks and forbade their enteringany of the deserted houses or taking anything from them.  We halted atnight on the road and proceeded the next morning at an early hour.Harris had been encamped in a creek bottom for the sake of being nearwater. The hills on either side of the creek extend to a considerableheight, possibly more than a hundred feet.  As we approached the brow ofthe hill from which it was expected we could see Harris' camp, andpossibly find his men ready formed to meet us, my heart kept gettinghigher and higher until it felt to me as though it was in my throat.  Iwould have given anything then to have been back in Illinois, but I hadnot the moral courage to halt and consider what to do; I kept right on.When we reached a point from which the valley below was in full view Ihalted. The place where Harris had been encamped a few days before wasstill there and the marks of a recent encampment were plainly visible,but the troops were gone.  My heart resumed its place.  It occurred tome at once that Harris had been as much afraid of me as I had been ofhim. This was a view of the question I had never taken before; but itwas one I never forgot afterwards.  From that event to the close of thewar, I never experienced trepidation upon confronting an enemy, though Ialways felt more or less anxiety.  I never forgot that he had as muchreason to fear my forces as I had his.  The lesson was valuable.Inquiries at the village of Florida divulged the fact that ColonelHarris, learning of my intended movement, while my transportation wasbeing collected took time by the forelock and left Florida before I hadstarted from Salt River.  He had increased the distance between us byforty miles.  The next day I started back to my old camp at Salt Riverbridge.  The citizens living on the line of our march had returned totheir houses after we passed, and finding everything in good order,nothing carried away, they were at their front doors ready to greet usnow.  They had evidently been led to believe that the National troopscarried death and devastation with them wherever they went.In a short time after our return to Salt River bridge I was ordered withmy regiment to the town of Mexico.  General Pope was then commanding thedistrict embracing all of the State of Missouri between the Mississippiand Missouri rivers, with his headquarters in the village of Mexico.  Iwas assigned to the command of a sub-district embracing the troops inthe immediate neighborhood, some three regiments of infantry and asection of artillery.  There was one regiment encamped by the side ofmine.  I assumed command of the whole and the first night sent thecommander of the other regiment the parole and countersign.  Not wishingto be outdone in courtesy, he immediately sent me the countersign forhis regiment for the night.  When he was informed that the countersignsent to him was for use with his regiment as well as mine, it wasdifficult to make him understand that this was not an unwarrantedinterference of one colonel over another.  No doubt he attributed it forthe time to the presumption of a graduate of West Point over a volunteerpure and simple.  But the question was soon settled and we had nofurther trouble.My arrival in Mexico had been preceded by that of two or three regimentsin which proper discipline had not been maintained, and the men had beenin the habit of visiting houses without invitation and helpingthemselves to food and drink, or demanding them from the occupants.They carried their muskets while out of camp and made every man theyfound take the oath of allegiance to the government.  I at oncepublished orders prohibiting the soldiers from going into private housesunless invited by the inhabitants, and from appropriating privateproperty to their own or to government uses.  The people were no longermolested or made afraid.  I received the most marked courtesy from thecitizens of Mexico as long as I remained there.Up to this time my regiment had not been carried in the school of thesoldier beyond the company drill, except that it had received sometraining on the march from Springfield to the Illinois River.  There wasnow a good opportunity of exercising it in the battalion drill.  While Iwas at West Point the tactics used in the army had been Scott's and themusket the flint lock.  I had never looked at a copy of tactics from thetime of my graduation.  My standing in that branch of studies had beennear the foot of the class.  In the Mexican war in the summer of 1846, Ihad been appointed regimental quartermaster and commissary and had notbeen at a battalion drill since.  The arms had been changed since thenand Hardee's tactics had been adopted.  I got a copy of tactics andstudied one lesson, intending to confine the exercise of the first dayto the commands I had thus learned.  By pursuing this course from day today I thought I would soon get through the volume.We were encamped just outside of town on the common, among scatteringsuburban houses with enclosed gardens, and when I got my regiment inline and rode to the front I soon saw that if I attempted to follow thelesson I had studied I would have to clear away some of the houses andgarden fences to make room.  I perceived at once, however, that Hardee'stactics--a mere translation from the French with Hardee's name attached--was nothing more than common sense and the progress of the age appliedto Scott's system.  The commands were abbreviated and the movementexpedited.  Under the old tactics almost every change in the order ofmarch was preceded by a 'halt,' then came the change, and then the'forward march.'  With the new tactics all these changes could be madewhile in motion.  I found no trouble in giving commands that would takemy regiment where I wanted it to go and carry it around all obstacles.I do not believe that the officers of the regiment ever discovered thatI had never studied the tactics that I used.
ISFP	 XIX.COMMISSIONED BRIGADIER-GENERAL--COMMAND AT IRONTON, MO.--JEFFERSON CITY--CAPE GIRARDEAU--GENERAL PRENTISS--SEIZURE OF PADUCAH--HEADQUARTERS ATCAIRO.I had not been in Mexico many weeks when, reading a St. Louis paper,I found the President had asked the Illinois delegation in Congressto recommend some citizens of the State for the position ofbrigadier-general, and that they had unanimously recommended me as firston a list of seven.  I was very much surprised because, as I have said,my acquaintance with the Congressmen was very limited and I did not knowof anything I had done to inspire such confidence.  The papers of thenext day announced that my name, with three others, had been sent to theSenate, and a few days after our confirmation was announced.When appointed brigadier-general I at once thought it proper that one ofmy aides should come from the regiment I had been commanding, and soselected Lieutenant C. B. Lagow.  While living in St. Louis, I had had adesk in the law office of McClellan, Moody and Hillyer.  Difference inviews between the members of the firm on the questions of the day, andgeneral hard times in the border cities, had broken up this firm.Hillyer was quite a young man, then in his twenties, and very brilliant.I asked him to accept a place on my staff.  I also wanted to take oneman from my new home, Galena.  The canvass in the Presidential campaignthe fall before had brought out a young lawyer by the name of John A.Rawlins, who proved himself one of the ablest speakers in the State.  Hewas also a candidate for elector on the Douglas ticket.  When Sumter wasfired upon and the integrity of the Union threatened, there was no manmore ready to serve his country than he.  I wrote at once asking him toaccept the position of assistant adjutant-general with the rank ofcaptain, on my staff.  He was about entering the service as major of anew regiment then organizing in the north-western part of the State; buthe threw this up and accepted my offer.Neither Hillyer nor Lagow proved to have any particular taste or specialqualifications for the duties of the soldier, and the former resignedduring the Vicksburg campaign; the latter I relieved after the battle ofChattanooga.  Rawlins remained with me as long as he lived, and rose tothe rank of brigadier general and chief-of-staff to the General of theArmy--an office created for him--before the war closed.  He was an ableman, possessed of great firmness, and could say 'no' so emphatically toa request which he thought should not be granted that the person he wasaddressing would understand at once that there was no use of pressingthe matter.  General Rawlins was a very useful officer in other waysthan this.  I became very much attached to him.Shortly after my promotion I was ordered to Ironton, Missouri, tocommand a district in that part of the State, and took the 21stIllinois, my old regiment, with me.  Several other regiments wereordered to the same destination about the same time.  Ironton is on theIron Mountain railroad, about seventy miles south of St. Louis, andsituated among hills rising almost to the dignity of mountains.  When Ireached there, about the 8th of August, Colonel B. Gratz Brown--afterwards Governor of Missouri and in 1872 Vice-Presidential candidate--was in command.  Some of his troops were ninety days' men and theirtime had expired some time before.  The men had no clothing but whatthey had volunteered in, and much of this was so worn that it wouldhardly stay on.  General Hardee--the author of the tactics I did notstudy--was at Greenville some twenty-five miles further south, it wassaid, with five thousand Confederate troops.  Under these circumstancesColonel Brown's command was very much demoralized.  A squadron ofcavalry could have ridden into the valley and captured the entire force.Brown himself was gladder to see me on that occasion than he ever hasbeen since.  I relieved him and sent all his men home within a day ortwo, to be mustered out of service.Within ten days after reading Ironton I was prepared to take theoffensive against the enemy at Greenville.  I sent a column east out ofthe valley we were in, with orders to swing around to the south and westand come into the Greenville road ten miles south of Ironton.  Anothercolumn marched on the direct road and went into camp at the pointdesignated for the two columns to meet. I was to ride out the nextmorning and take personal command of the movement.  My experienceagainst Harris, in northern Missouri, had inspired me with confidence.But when the evening train came in, it brought General B. M. Prentisswith orders to take command of the district.  His orders did not relieveme, but I knew that by law I was senior, and at that time even thePresident did not have the authority to assign a junior to command asenior of the same grade.  I therefore gave General Prentiss thesituation of the troops and the general condition of affairs, andstarted for St. Louis the same day.  The movement against the rebels atGreenville went no further.From St. Louis I was ordered to Jefferson City, the capital of theState, to take command.  General Sterling Price, of the Confederatearmy, was thought to be threatening the capital, Lexington, Chillicotheand other comparatively large towns in the central part of Missouri.  Ifound a good many troops in Jefferson City, but in the greatestconfusion, and no one person knew where they all were.  ColonelMulligan, a gallant man, was in command, but he had not been educated asyet to his new profession and did not know how to maintain discipline.I found that volunteers had obtained permission from the departmentcommander, or claimed they had, to raise, some of them, regiments; somebattalions; some companies--the officers to be commissioned according tothe number of men they brought into the service.  There were recruitingstations all over town, with notices, rudely lettered on boards over thedoors, announcing the arm of service and length of time for whichrecruits at that station would be received.  The law required allvolunteers to serve for three years or the war.  But in Jefferson Cityin August, 1861, they were recruited for different periods and ondifferent conditions; some were enlisted for six months, some for ayear, some without any condition as to where they were to serve, otherswere not to be sent out of the State.  The recruits were principally menfrom regiments stationed there and already in the service, bound forthree years if the war lasted that long.The city was filled with Union fugitives who had been driven by guerillabands to take refuge with the National troops.  They were in adeplorable condition and must have starved but for the support thegovernment gave them.  They had generally made their escape with a teamor two, sometimes a yoke of oxen with a mule or a horse in the lead.  Alittle bedding besides their clothing and some food had been thrown intothe wagon.  All else of their worldly goods were abandoned andappropriated by their former neighbors; for the Union man in Missouriwho staid at home during the rebellion, if he was not immediately underthe protection of the National troops, was at perpetual war with hisneighbors.  I stopped the recruiting service, and disposed the troopsabout the outskirts of the city so as to guard all approaches.  Orderwas soon restored.I had been at Jefferson City but a few days when I was directed fromdepartment headquarters to fit out an expedition to Lexington,Booneville and Chillicothe, in order to take from the banks in thosecities all the funds they had and send them to St. Louis.  The westernarmy had not yet been supplied with transportation.  It became necessarytherefore to press into the service teams belonging to sympathizers withthe rebellion or to hire those of Union men.  This afforded anopportunity of giving employment to such of the refugees within ourlines as had teams suitable for our purposes.  They accepted the servicewith alacrity.  As fast as troops could be got off they were moved westsome twenty miles or more.  In seven or eight days from my assumingcommand at Jefferson City, I had all the troops, except a smallgarrison, at an advanced position and expected to join them myself thenext day.But my campaigns had not yet begun, for while seated at my office door,with nothing further to do until it was time to start for the front, Isaw an officer of rank approaching, who proved to be Colonel JeffersonC. Davis.  I had never met him before, but he introduced himself byhanding me an order for him to proceed to Jefferson City and relieve meof the command.  The orders directed that I should report at departmentheadquarters at St. Louis without delay, to receive important specialinstructions.  It was about an hour before the only regular train of theday would start.  I therefore turned over to Colonel Davis my orders,and hurriedly stated to him the progress that had been made to carry outthe department instructions already described.  I had at that time butone staff officer, doing myself all the detail work usually performed byan adjutant-general.  In an hour after being relieved from the command Iwas on my way to St. Louis, leaving my single staff officer(*6) tofollow the next day with our horses and baggage.The 'important special instructions' which I received the next day,assigned me to the command of the district of south-east Missouri,embracing all the territory south of St. Louis, in Missouri, as well asall southern Illinois.  At first I was to take personal command of acombined expedition that had been ordered for the capture of ColonelJeff. Thompson, a sort of independent or partisan commander who wasdisputing with us the possession of south-east Missouri.  Troops hadbeen ordered to move from Ironton to Cape Girardeau, sixty or seventymiles to the south-east, on the Mississippi River; while the forces atCape Girardeau had been ordered to move to Jacksonville, ten miles outtowards Ironton; and troops at Cairo and Bird's Point, at the junctionof the Ohio and Mississippi rivers, were to hold themselves in readinessto go down the Mississippi to Belmont, eighteen miles below, to be movedwest from there when an officer should come to command them.  I was theofficer who had been selected for this purpose.  Cairo was to become myheadquarters when the expedition terminated.In pursuance of my orders I established my temporary headquarters atCape Girardeau and sent instructions to the commanding officer atJackson, to inform me of the approach of General Prentiss from Ironton.Hired wagons were kept moving night and day to take additional rationsto Jackson, to supply the troops when they started from there.  NeitherGeneral Prentiss nor Colonel Marsh, who commanded at Jackson, knew theirdestination.  I drew up all the instructions for the contemplated move,and kept them in my pocket until I should hear of the junction of ourtroops at Jackson.  Two or three days after my arrival at CapeGirardeau, word came that General Prentiss was approaching that place(Jackson).  I started at once to meet him there and to give him hisorders.  As I turned the first corner of a street after starting, I sawa column of cavalry passing the next street in front of me.  I turnedand rode around the block the other way, so as to meet the head of thecolumn.  I found there General Prentiss himself, with a large escort.He had halted his troops at Jackson for the night, and had come onhimself to Cape Girardeau, leaving orders for his command to follow himin the morning.  I gave the General his orders--which stopped him atJackson--but he was very much aggrieved at being placed under anotherbrigadier-general, particularly as he believed himself to be the senior.He had been a brigadier, in command at Cairo, while I was musteringofficer at Springfield without any rank.  But we were nominated at thesame time for the United States service, and both our commissions boredate May 17th, 1861.  By virtue of my former army rank I was, by law,the senior.  General Prentiss failed to get orders to his troops toremain at Jackson, and the next morning early they were reported asapproaching Cape Girardeau.  I then ordered the General veryperemptorily to countermarch his command and take it back to Jackson.He obeyed the order, but bade his command adieu when he got them toJackson, and went to St. Louis and reported himself.  This broke up theexpedition.  But little harm was done, as Jeff. Thompson moved light andhad no fixed place for even nominal headquarters.  He was as much athome in Arkansas as he was in Missouri and would keep out of the way ofa superior force.  Prentiss was sent to another part of the State.General Prentiss made a great mistake on the above occasion, one that hewould not have committed later in the war.  When I came to know himbetter, I regretted it much.  In consequence of this occurrence he wasoff duty in the field when the principal campaign at the West was goingon, and his juniors received promotion while he was where none could beobtained.  He would have been next to myself in rank in the district ofsouth-east Missouri, by virtue of his services in the Mexican war.  Hewas a brave and very earnest soldier.  No man in the service was moresincere in his devotion to the cause for which we were battling; nonemore ready to make sacrifices or risk life in it.On the 4th of September I removed my headquarters to Cairo and foundColonel Richard Oglesby in command of the post.  We had never met, atleast not to my knowledge.  After my promotion I had ordered mybrigadier-general's uniform from New York, but it had not yet arrived,so that I was in citizen's dress.  The Colonel had his office full ofpeople, mostly from the neighboring States of Missouri and Kentucky,making complaints or asking favors.  He evidently did not catch my namewhen I was presented, for on my taking a piece of paper from the tablewhere he was seated and writing the order assuming command of thedistrict of south-east Missouri, Colonel Richard J. Oglesby to commandthe post at Bird's Point, and handing it to him, he put on an expressionof surprise that looked a little as if he would like to have some oneidentify me.  But he surrendered the office without question.The day after I assumed command at Cairo a man came to me who said hewas a scout of General Fremont.  He reported that he had just come fromColumbus, a point on the Mississippi twenty miles below on the Kentuckyside, and that troops had started from there, or were about to start, toseize Paducah, at the mouth of the Tennessee.  There was no time fordelay; I reported by telegraph to the department commander theinformation I had received, and added that I was taking steps to get offthat night to be in advance of the enemy in securing that importantpoint.  There was a large number of steamers lying at Cairo and a goodmany boatmen were staying in the town.  It was the work of only a fewhours to get the boats manned, with coal aboard and steam up.  Troopswere also designated to go aboard.  The distance from Cairo to Paducahis about forty-five miles.  I did not wish to get there before daylightof the 6th, and directed therefore that the boats should lie at anchorout in the stream until the time to start.  Not having received ananswer to my first dispatch, I again telegraphed to departmentheadquarters that I should start for Paducah that night unless Ireceived further orders.  Hearing nothing, we started before midnightand arrived early the following morning, anticipating the enemy byprobably not over six or eight hours.  It proved very fortunate that theexpedition against Jeff. Thompson had been broken up. Had it not been,the enemy would have seized Paducah and fortified it, to our very greatannoyance.When the National troops entered the town the citizens were taken bysurprise.  I never after saw such consternation depicted on the faces ofthe people.  Men, women and children came out of their doors lookingpale and frightened at the presence of the invader.  They were expectingrebel troops that day.  In fact, nearly four thousand men from Columbuswere at that time within ten or fifteen miles of Paducah on their way tooccupy the place.  I had but two regiments and one battery with me, butthe enemy did not know this and returned to Columbus.  I stationed mytroops at the best points to guard the roads leading into the city, leftgunboats to guard the river fronts and by noon was ready to start on myreturn to Cairo.  Before leaving, however, I addressed a short printedproclamation to the citizens of Paducah assuring them of our peacefulintentions, that we had come among them to protect them against theenemies of our country, and that all who chose could continue theirusual avocations with assurance of the protection of the government.This was evidently a relief to them; but the majority would have muchpreferred the presence of the other army.  I reinforced Paducah rapidlyfrom the troops at Cape Girardeau; and a day or two later General C. F.Smith, a most accomplished soldier, reported at Cairo and was assignedto the command of the post at the mouth of the Tennessee.  In a shorttime it was well fortified and a detachment was sent to occupySmithland, at the mouth of the Cumberland.The State government of Kentucky at that time was rebel in sentiment,but wanted to preserve an armed neutrality between the North and theSouth, and the governor really seemed to think the State had a perfectright to maintain a neutral position. The rebels already occupied twotowns in the State, Columbus and Hickman, on the Mississippi; and at thevery moment the National troops were entering Paducah from the Ohiofront, General Lloyd Tilghman--a Confederate--with his staff and a smalldetachment of men, were getting out in the other direction, while, as Ihave already said, nearly four thousand Confederate troops were onKentucky soil on their way to take possession of the town. But, in theestimation of the governor and of those who thought with him, this didnot justify the National authorities in invading the soil of Kentucky.I informed the legislature of the State of what I was doing, and myaction was approved by the majority of that body.  On my return to CairoI found authority from department headquarters for me to take Paducah'if I felt strong enough,' but very soon after I was reprimanded fromthe same quarters for my correspondence with the legislature and warnedagainst a repetition of the offence.Soon after I took command at Cairo, General Fremont entered intoarrangements for the exchange of the prisoners captured at Camp Jacksonin the month of May.  I received orders to pass them through my lines toColumbus as they presented themselves with proper credentials.  Quite anumber of these prisoners I had been personally acquainted with beforethe war.  Such of them as I had so known were received at myheadquarters as old acquaintances, and ordinary routine business was notdisturbed by their presence.  On one occasion when several were presentin my office my intention to visit Cape Girardeau the next day, toinspect the troops at that point, was mentioned.  Something transpiredwhich postponed my trip; but a steamer employed by the government waspassing a point some twenty or more miles above Cairo, the next day,when a section of rebel artillery with proper escort brought her to.  Amajor, one of those who had been at my headquarters the day before, cameat once aboard and after some search made a direct demand for mydelivery.  It was hard to persuade him that I was not there.  Thisofficer was Major Barrett, of St. Louis.  I had been acquainted with hisfamily before the war.
ISFP	 XX.GENERAL FREMONT IN COMMAND--MOVEMENT AGAINST BELMONT--BATTLE OF BELMONT--A NARROW ESCAPE--AFTER THE BATTLE.From the occupation of Paducah up to the early part of November nothingimportant occurred with the troops under my command.  I was reinforcedfrom time to time and the men were drilled and disciplined preparatoryfor the service which was sure to come.  By the 1st of November I hadnot fewer than 20,000 men, most of them under good drill and ready tomeet any equal body of men who, like themselves, had not yet been in anengagement.  They were growing impatient at lying idle so long, almostin hearing of the guns of the enemy they had volunteered to fightagainst.  I asked on one or two occasions to be allowed to move againstColumbus.  It could have been taken soon after the occupation ofPaducah; but before November it was so strongly fortified that it wouldhave required a large force and a long siege to capture it.In the latter part of October General Fremont took the field in personand moved from Jefferson City against General Sterling Price, who wasthen in the State of Missouri with a considerable command.  About thefirst of November I was directed from department headquarters to make ademonstration on both sides of the Mississippi River with the view ofdetaining the rebels at Columbus within their lines.  Before my troopscould be got off, I was notified from the same quarter that there weresome 3,000 of the enemy on the St. Francis River about fifty miles west,or south-west, from Cairo, and was ordered to send another force againstthem.  I dispatched Colonel Oglesby at once with troops sufficient tocompete with the reported number of the enemy.  On the 5th word camefrom the same source that the rebels were about to detach a large forcefrom Columbus to be moved by boats down the Mississippi and up the WhiteRiver, in Arkansas, in order to reinforce Price, and I was directed toprevent this movement if possible.  I accordingly sent a regiment fromBird's Point under Colonel W. H. L. Wallace to overtake and reinforceOglesby, with orders to march to New Madrid, a point some distance belowColumbus, on the Missouri side.  At the same time I directed General C.F. Smith to move all the troops he could spare from Paducah directlyagainst Columbus, halting them, however, a few miles from the town toawait further orders from me.  Then I gathered up all the troops atCairo and Fort Holt, except suitable guards, and moved them down theriver on steamers convoyed by two gunboats, accompanying them myself.My force consisted of a little over 3,000 men and embraced fiveregiments of infantry, two guns and two companies of cavalry.  Wedropped down the river on the 6th to within about six miles of Columbus,debarked a few men on the Kentucky side and established pickets toconnect with the troops from Paducah.I had no orders which contemplated an attack by the National troops, nordid I intend anything of the kind when I started out from Cairo; butafter we started I saw that the officers and men were elated at theprospect of at last having the opportunity of doing what they hadvolunteered to do--fight the enemies of their country.  I did not seehow I could maintain discipline, or retain the confidence of my command,if we should return to Cairo without an effort to do something.Columbus, besides being strongly fortified, contained a garrison muchmore numerous than the force I had with me.  It would not do, therefore,to attack that point.  About two o'clock on the morning of the 7th, Ilearned that the enemy was crossing troops from Columbus to the westbank to be dispatched, presumably, after Oglesby.  I knew there was asmall camp of Confederates at Belmont, immediately opposite Columbus,and I speedily resolved to push down the river, land on the Missouriside, capture Belmont, break up the camp and return.  Accordingly, thepickets above Columbus were drawn in at once, and about daylight theboats moved out from shore.  In an hour we were debarking on the westbank of the Mississippi, just out of range of the batteries at Columbus.The ground on the west shore of the river, opposite Columbus, is low andin places marshy and cut up with sloughs.  The soil is rich and thetimber large and heavy.  There were some small clearings between Belmontand the point where we landed, but most of the country was covered withthe native forests.  We landed in front of a cornfield.  When thedebarkation commenced, I took a regiment down the river to post it as aguard against surprise.  At that time I had no staff officer who couldbe trusted with that duty.  In the woods, at a short distance below theclearing, I found a depression, dry at the time, but which at high waterbecame a slough or bayou.  I placed the men in the hollow, gave themtheir instructions and ordered them to remain there until they wereproperly relieved.  These troops, with the gunboats, were to protect ourtransports.Up to this time the enemy had evidently failed to divine our intentions.From Columbus they could, of course, see our gunboats and transportsloaded with troops.  But the force from Paducah was threatening themfrom the land side, and it was hardly to be expected that if Columbuswas our object we would separate our troops by a wide river.  Theydoubtless thought we meant to draw a large force from the east bank,then embark ourselves, land on the east bank and make a sudden assaulton Columbus before their divided command could be united.About eight o'clock we started from the point of debarkation, marchingby the flank.  After moving in this way for a mile or a mile and a half,I halted where there was marshy ground covered with a heavy growth oftimber in our front, and deployed a large part of my force asskirmishers.  By this time the enemy discovered that we were moving uponBelmont and sent out troops to meet us.  Soon after we had started inline, his skirmishers were encountered and fighting commenced.  Thiscontinued, growing fiercer and fiercer, for about four hours, the enemybeing forced back gradually until he was driven into his camp. Early inthis engagement my horse was shot under me, but I got another from oneof my staff and kept well up with the advance until the river wasreached.The officers and men engaged at Belmont were then under fire for thefirst time.  Veterans could not have behaved better than they did up tothe moment of reaching the rebel camp.  At this point they becamedemoralized from their victory and failed to reap its full reward.  Theenemy had been followed so closely that when he reached the clear groundon which his camp was pitched he beat a hasty retreat over the riverbank, which protected him from our shots and from view.  Thisprecipitate retreat at the last moment enabled the National forces topick their way without hinderance through the abatis--the onlyartificial defence the enemy had.  The moment the camp was reached ourmen laid down their arms and commenced rummaging the tents to pick uptrophies.  Some of the higher officers were little better than theprivates.  They galloped about from one cluster of men to another and atevery halt delivered a short eulogy upon the Union cause and theachievements of the command.All this time the troops we had been engaged with for four hours, laycrouched under cover of the river bank, ready to come up and surrenderif summoned to do so; but finding that they were not pursued, theyworked their way up the river and came up on the bank between us and ourtransports.  I saw at the same time two steamers coming from theColumbus side towards the west shore, above us, black--or gray--withsoldiers from boiler-deck to roof.  Some of my men were engaged infiring from captured guns at empty steamers down the river, out ofrange, cheering at every shot.  I tried to get them to turn their gunsupon the loaded steamers above and not so far away.  My efforts were invain.  At last I directed my staff officers to set fire to the camps.This drew the fire of the enemy's guns located on the heights ofColumbus.  They had abstained from firing before, probably because theywere afraid of hitting their own men; or they may have supposed, untilthe camp was on fire, that it was still in the possession of theirfriends.  About this time, too, the men we had driven over the bank wereseen in line up the river between us and our transports.  The alarm'surrounded' was given.  The guns of the enemy and the report of beingsurrounded, brought officers and men completely under control.  At firstsome of the officers seemed to think that to be surrounded was to beplaced in a hopeless position, where there was nothing to do butsurrender.  But when I announced that we had cut our way in and couldcut our way out just as well, it seemed a new revelation to officers andsoldiers.  They formed line rapidly and we started back to our boats,with the men deployed as skirmishers as they had been on entering camp.The enemy was soon encountered, but his resistance this time was feeble.Again the Confederates sought shelter under the river banks.  We couldnot stop, however, to pick them up, because the troops we had seencrossing the river had debarked by this time and were nearer ourtransports than we were.  It would be prudent to get them behind us; butwe were not again molested on our way to the boats.From the beginning of the fighting our wounded had been carried to thehouses at the rear, near the place of debarkation.  I now set the troopsto bringing their wounded to the boats.  After this had gone on for somelittle time I rode down the road, without even a staff officer, to visitthe guard I had stationed over the approach to our transports.  I knewthe enemy had crossed over from Columbus in considerable numbers andmight be expected to attack us as we were embarking.  This guard wouldbe encountered first and, as they were in a natural intrenchment, wouldbe able to hold the enemy for a considerable time.  My surprise wasgreat to find there was not a single man in the trench.  Riding back tothe boat I found the officer who had commanded the guard and learnedthat he had withdrawn his force when the main body fell back.  At firstI ordered the guard to return, but finding that it would take some timeto get the men together and march them back to their position, Icountermanded the order.  Then fearing that the enemy we had seencrossing the river below might be coming upon us unawares, I rode out inthe field to our front, still entirely alone, to observe whether theenemy was passing.  The field was grown up with corn so tall and thickas to cut off the view of even a person on horseback, except directlyalong the rows.  Even in that direction, owing to the overhanging bladesof corn, the view was not extensive. I had not gone more than a fewhundred yards when I saw a body of troops marching past me not fiftyyards away.  I looked at them for a moment and then turned my horsetowards the river and started back, first in a walk, and when I thoughtmyself concealed from the view of the enemy, as fast as my horse couldcarry me.  When at the river bank I still had to ride a few hundredyards to the point where the nearest transport lay.The cornfield in front of our transports terminated at the edge of adense forest.  Before I got back the enemy had entered this forest andhad opened a brisk fire upon the boats.  Our men, with the exception ofdetails that had gone to the front after the wounded, were now eitheraboard the transports or very near them.  Those who were not aboard soongot there, and the boats pushed off.  I was the only man of the Nationalarmy between the rebels and our transports.  The captain of a boat thathad just pushed out but had not started, recognized me and ordered theengineer not to start the engine; he then had a plank run out for me.My horse seemed to take in the situation.  There was no path down thebank and every one acquainted with the Mississippi River knows that itsbanks, in a natural state, do not vary at any great angle from theperpendicular.  My horse put his fore feet over the bank withouthesitation or urging, and with his hind feet well under him, slid downthe bank and trotted aboard the boat, twelve or fifteen feet away, overa single gang plank.  I dismounted and went at once to the upper deck.The Mississippi River was low on the 7th of November, 1861, so that thebanks were higher than the heads of men standing on the upper decks ofthe steamers.  The rebels were some distance back from the river, sothat their fire was high and did us but little harm.  Our smoke-stackwas riddled with bullets, but there were only three men wounded on theboats, two of whom were soldiers.  When I first went on deck I enteredthe captain's room adjoining the pilot-house, and threw myself on asofa.  I did not keep that position a moment, but rose to go out on thedeck to observe what was going on.  I had scarcely left when a musketball entered the room, struck the head of the sofa, passed through itand lodged in the foot.When the enemy opened fire on the transports our gunboats returned itwith vigor.  They were well out in the stream and some distance down, sothat they had to give but very little elevation to their guns to clearthe banks of the river.  Their position very nearly enfiladed the lineof the enemy while he was marching through the cornfield.  The executionwas very great, as we could see at the time and as I afterwards learnedmore positively.  We were very soon out of range and went peacefully onour way to Cairo, every man feeling that Belmont was a great victory andthat he had contributed his share to it.Our loss at Belmont was 485 in killed, wounded and missing. About 125 ofour wounded fell into the hands of the enemy.  We returned with 175prisoners and two guns, and spiked four other pieces.  The loss of theenemy, as officially reported, was 642 men, killed, wounded and missing.We had engaged about 2,500 men, exclusive of the guard left with thetransports.  The enemy had about 7,000; but this includes the troopsbrought over from Columbus who were not engaged in the first defence ofBelmont.The two objects for which the battle of Belmont was fought were fullyaccomplished.  The enemy gave up all idea of detaching troops fromColumbus.  His losses were very heavy for that period of the war.Columbus was beset by people looking for their wounded or dead kin, totake them home for medical treatment or burial.  I learned later, when Ihad moved further south, that Belmont had caused more mourning thanalmost any other battle up to that time.  The National troops acquired aconfidence in themselves at Belmont that did not desert them through thewar.The day after the battle I met some officers from General Polk'scommand, arranged for permission to bury our dead at Belmont and alsocommenced negotiations for the exchange of prisoners.  When our men wentto bury their dead, before they were allowed to land they were conductedbelow the point where the enemy had engaged our transports.  Some of theofficers expressed a desire to see the field; but the request wasrefused with the statement that we had no dead there.While on the truce-boat I mentioned to an officer, whom I had known bothat West Point and in the Mexican war, that I was in the cornfield neartheir troops when they passed; that I had been on horseback and had worna soldier's overcoat at the time.  This officer was on General Polk'sstaff.  He said both he and the general had seen me and that Polk hadsaid to his men, 'There is a Yankee; you may try your marksmanship onhim if you wish,' but nobody fired at me.Belmont was severely criticised in the North as a wholly unnecessarybattle, barren of results, or the possibility of them from thebeginning.  If it had not been fought, Colonel Oglesby would probablyhave been captured or destroyed with his three thousand men.  Then Ishould have been culpable indeed.
ISFP	 XXI.GENERAL HALLECK IN COMMAND--COMMANDING THE DISTRICT OF CAIRO--MOVEMENTON FORT HENRY--CAPTURE OF FORT HENRY.While at Cairo I had frequent opportunities of meeting the rebelofficers of the Columbus garrison.  They seemed to be very fond ofcoming up on steamers under flags of truce.  On two or three occasions Iwent down in like manner.  When one of their boats was seen coming upcarrying a white flag, a gun would be fired from the lower battery atFort Holt, throwing a shot across the bow as a signal to come nofarther.  I would then take a steamer and, with my staff andoccasionally a few other officers, go down to receive the party.  Therewere several officers among them whom I had known before, both at WESTJoint and in Mexico. Seeing these officers who had been educated for theprofession of arms, both at school and in actual war, which is a farmore efficient training, impressed me with the great advantage the Southpossessed over the North at the beginning of the rebellion.  They hadfrom thirty to forty per cent. of the educated soldiers of the Nation.They had no standing army and, consequently, these trained soldiers hadto find employment with the troops from their own States.  In this waywhat there was of military education and training was distributedthroughout their whole army.  The whole loaf was leavened.The North had a great number of educated and trained soldiers, but thebulk of them were still in the army and were retained, generally withtheir old commands and rank, until the war had lasted many months.  Inthe Army of the Potomac there was what was known as the 'regularbrigade,' in which, from the commanding officer down to the youngestsecond lieutenant, every one was educated to his profession.  So, too,with many of the batteries; all the officers, generally four in numberto each, were men educated for their profession.  Some of these wentinto battle at the beginning under division commanders who were entirelywithout military training.  This state of affairs gave me an idea whichI expressed while at Cairo; that the government ought to disband theregular army, with the exception of the staff corps, and notify thedisbanded officers that they would receive no compensation while the warlasted except as volunteers.  The register should be kept up, but thenames of all officers who were not in the volunteer service at theclose, should be stricken from it.On the 9th of November, two days after the battle of Belmont,Major-General H. W. Halleck superseded General Fremont in command of theDepartment of the Missouri.  The limits of his command took in Arkansasand west Kentucky east to the Cumberland River.  From the battle ofBelmont until early in February, 1862, the troops under my command didlittle except prepare for the long struggle which proved to be beforethem.The enemy at this time occupied a line running from the MississippiRiver at Columbus to Bowling Green and Mill Springs, Kentucky.  Each ofthese positions was strongly fortified, as were also points on theTennessee and Cumberland rivers near the Tennessee state line.  Theworks on the Tennessee were called Fort Heiman and Fort Henry, and thaton the Cumberland was Fort Donelson.  At these points the two riversapproached within eleven miles of each other.  The lines of rifle pitsat each place extended back from the water at least two miles, so thatthe garrisons were in reality only seven miles apart.  These positionswere of immense importance to the enemy; and of course correspondinglyimportant for us to possess ourselves of.  With Fort Henry in our handswe had a navigable stream open to us up to Muscle Shoals, in Alabama.The Memphis and Charleston Railroad strikes the Tennessee at Eastport,Mississippi, and follows close to the banks of the river up to theshoals.  This road, of vast importance to the enemy, would cease to beof use to them for through traffic the moment Fort Henry became ours.Fort Donelson was the gate to Nashville--a place of great military andpolitical importance--and to a rich country extending far east inKentucky.  These two points in our possession the enemy wouldnecessarily be thrown back to the Memphis and Charleston road, or to theboundary of the cotton states, and, as before stated, that road would belost to them for through communication.The designation of my command had been changed after Halleck's arrival,from the District of South-east Missouri to the District of Cairo, andthe small district commanded by General C. F. Smith, embracing themouths of the Tennessee and Cumberland rivers, had been added to myjurisdiction.  Early in January, 1862, I was directed by GeneralMcClellan, through my department commander, to make a reconnoissance infavor of Brigadier-General Don Carlos Buell, who commanded theDepartment of the Ohio, with headquarters at Louisville, and who wasconfronting General S. B. Buckner with a larger Confederate force atBowling Green.  It was supposed that Buell was about to make some moveagainst the enemy, and my demonstration was intended to prevent thesending of troops from Columbus, Fort Henry or Donelson to Buckner.  Iat once ordered General Smith to send a force up the west bank of theTennessee to threaten forts Heiman and Henry; McClernand at the sametime with a force of 6,000 men was sent out into west Kentucky,threatening Columbus with one column and the Tennessee River withanother. I went with McClernand's command.  The weather was very bad;snow and rain fell; the roads, never good in that section, wereintolerable.  We were out more than a week splashing through the mud,snow and rain, the men suffering very much.  The object of theexpedition was accomplished.  The enemy did not send reinforcements toBowling Green, and General George H. Thomas fought and won the battle ofMill Springs before we returned.As a result of this expedition General Smith reported that he thought itpracticable to capture Fort Heiman.  This fort stood on high ground,completely commanding Fort Henry on the opposite side of the river, andits possession by us, with the aid of our gunboats, would insure thecapture of Fort Henry.  This report of Smith's confirmed views I hadpreviously held, that the true line of operations for us was up theTennessee and Cumberland rivers.  With us there, the enemy would becompelled to fall back on the east and west entirely out of the State ofKentucky.  On the 6th of January, before receiving orders for thisexpedition, I had asked permission of the general commanding thedepartment to go to see him at St. Louis.  My object was to lay thisplan of campaign before him.  Now that my views had been confirmed by soable a general as Smith, I renewed my request to go to St. Louis on whatI deemed important military business.  The leave was granted, but notgraciously.  I had known General Halleck but very slightly in the oldarmy, not having met him either at West Point or during the Mexican war.I was received with so little cordiality that I perhaps stated theobject of my visit with less clearness than I might have done, and I hadnot uttered many sentences before I was cut short as if my plan waspreposterous.  I returned to Cairo very much crestfallen.Flag-officer Foote commanded the little fleet of gunboats then in theneighborhood of Cairo and, though in another branch of the service, wassubject to the command of General Halleck.  He and I consulted freelyupon military matters and he agreed with me perfectly as to thefeasibility of the campaign up the Tennessee.  Notwithstanding therebuff I had received from my immediate chief, I therefore, on the 28thof January, renewed the suggestion by telegraph that 'if permitted, Icould take and hold Fort Henry on the Tennessee.'  This time I wasbacked by Flag-officer Foote, who sent a similar dispatch.  On the 29thI wrote fully in support of the proposition.  On the 1st of February Ireceived full instructions from department headquarters to move uponFort Henry.  On the 2d the expedition started.In February, 1862, there were quite a good many steamers laid up atCairo for want of employment, the Mississippi River being closed againstnavigation below that point.  There were also many men in the town whoseoccupation had been following the river in various capacities, fromcaptain down to deck hand But there were not enough of either boats ormen to move at one time the 17,000 men I proposed to take with me up theTennessee.  I loaded the boats with more than half the force, however,and sent General McClernand in command.  I followed with one of thelater boats and found McClernand had stopped, very properly, nine milesbelow Fort Henry.  Seven gunboats under Flag-officer Foote hadaccompanied the advance.  The transports we had with us had to return toPaducah to bring up a division from there, with General C. F. Smith incommand.Before sending the boats back I wanted to get the troops as near to theenemy as I could without coming within range of their guns.  There was astream emptying into the Tennessee on the east side, apparently at aboutlong range distance below the fort.  On account of the narrow water-shedseparating the Tennessee and Cumberland rivers at that point, the streammust be insignificant at ordinary stages, but when we were there, inFebruary, it was a torrent.  It would facilitate the investment of FortHenry materially if the troops could be landed south of that stream.  Totest whether this could be done I boarded the gunboat Essex andrequested Captain Wm. Porter commanding it, to approach the fort to drawits fire.  After we had gone some distance past the mouth of the streamwe drew the fire of the fort, which fell much short of us.  Inconsequence I had made up my mind to return and bring the troops to theupper side of the creek, when the enemy opened upon us with a rifled gunthat sent shot far beyond us and beyond the stream.  One shot passedvery near where Captain Porter and I were standing, struck the deck nearthe stern, penetrated and passed through the cabin and so out into theriver.  We immediately turned back, and the troops were debarked belowthe mouth of the creek.When the landing was completed I returned with the transports to Paducahto hasten up the balance of the troops.  I got back on the 5th with theadvance the remainder following as rapidly as the steamers could carrythem.  At ten o'clock at night, on the 5th, the whole command was notyet up.  Being anxious to commence operations as soon as possible beforethe enemy could reinforce heavily, I issued my orders for an advance at11 A.M. on the 6th.  I felt sure that all the troops would be up by thattime.Fort Henry occupies a bend in the river which gave the guns in the waterbattery a direct fire down the stream.  The camp outside the fort wasintrenched, with rifle pits and outworks two miles back on the road toDonelson and Dover.  The garrison of the fort and camp was about 2,800,with strong reinforcements from Donelson halted some miles out.  Therewere seventeen heavy guns in the fort.  The river was very high, thebanks being overflowed except where the bluffs come to the water's edge.A portion of the ground on which Fort Henry stood was two feet deep inwater.  Below, the water extended into the woods several hundred yardsback from the bank on the east side.  On the west bank Fort Heiman stoodon high ground, completely commanding Fort Henry.  The distance fromFort Henry to Donelson is but eleven miles.  The two positions were soimportant to the enemy, AS HE SAW HIS INTEREST, that it was natural tosuppose that reinforcements would come from every quarter from whichthey could be got.  Prompt action on our part was imperative.The plan was for the troops and gunboats to start at the same moment.The troops were to invest the garrison and the gunboats to attack thefort at close quarters.  General Smith was to land a brigade of hisdivision on the west bank during the night of the 5th and get it in rearof Heiman.At the hour designated the troops and gunboats started.  General Smithfound Fort Heiman had been evacuated before his men arrived.  Thegunboats soon engaged the water batteries at very close quarters, butthe troops which were to invest Fort Henry were delayed for want ofroads, as well as by the dense forest and the high water in what wouldin dry weather have been unimportant beds of streams.  This delay madeno difference in the result.  On our first appearance Tilghman had senthis entire command, with the exception of about one hundred men left toman the guns in the fort, to the outworks on the road to Dover andDonelson, so as to have them out of range of the guns of our navy; andbefore any attack on the 6th he had ordered them to retreat on Donelson.He stated in his subsequent report that the defence was intended solelyto give his troops time to make their escape.Tilghman was captured with his staff and ninety men, as well as thearmament of the fort, the ammunition and whatever stores were there.Our cavalry pursued the retreating column towards Donelson and picked uptwo guns and a few stragglers; but the enemy had so much the start, thatthe pursuing force did not get in sight of any except the stragglers.All the gunboats engaged were hit many times.  The damage, however,beyond what could be repaired by a small expenditure of money, wasslight, except to the Essex.  A shell penetrated the boiler of thatvessel and exploded it, killing and wounding forty-eight men, nineteenof whom were soldiers who had been detailed to act with the navy.  Onseveral occasions during the war such details were made when thecomplement of men with the navy was insufficient for the duty beforethem.  After the fall of Fort Henry Captain Phelps, commanding theiron-clad Carondelet, at my request ascended the Tennessee River andthoroughly destroyed the bridge of the Memphis and Ohio Railroad.
ISFP	 XXII.INVESTMENT OF FORT DONELSON--THE NAVAL OPERATIONS--ATTACK OF THE ENEMY--ASSAULTING THE WORKS--SURRENDER OF THE FORT.I informed the department commander of our success at Fort Henry andthat on the 8th I would take Fort Donelson.  But the rain continued tofall so heavily that the roads became impassable for artillery and wagontrains.  Then, too, it would not have been prudent to proceed withoutthe gunboats.  At least it would have been leaving behind a valuablepart of our available force.On the 7th, the day after the fall of Fort Henry, I took my staff andthe cavalry--a part of one regiment--and made a reconnoissance to withinabout a mile of the outer line of works at Donelson.  I had knownGeneral Pillow in Mexico, and judged that with any force, no matter howsmall, I could march up to within gunshot of any intrenchments he wasgiven to hold.  I said this to the officers of my staff at the time.  Iknew that Floyd was in command, but he was no soldier, and I judged thathe would yield to Pillow's pretensions.  I met, as I expected, noopposition in making the reconnoissance and, besides learning thetopography of the country on the way and around Fort Donelson, foundthat there were two roads available for marching; one leading to thevillage of Dover, the other to Donelson.Fort Donelson is two miles north, or down the river, from Dover.  Thefort, as it stood in 1861, embraced about one hundred acres of land.  Onthe east it fronted the Cumberland; to the north it faced Hickman'screek, a small stream which at that time was deep and wide because ofthe back-water from the river; on the south was another small stream, orrather a ravine, opening into the Cumberland.  This also was filled withback-water from the river.  The fort stood on high ground, some of it asmuch as a hundred feet above the Cumberland.  Strong protection to theheavy guns in the water batteries had been obtained by cutting awayplaces for them in the bluff.  To the west there was a line of riflepits some two miles back from the river at the farthest point.  Thisline ran generally along the crest of high ground, but in one placecrossed a ravine which opens into the river between the village and thefort.  The ground inside and outside of this intrenched line was verybroken and generally wooded.  The trees outside of the rifle-pits hadbeen cut down for a considerable way out, and had been felled so thattheir tops lay outwards from the intrenchments.  The limbs had beentrimmed and pointed, and thus formed an abatis in front of the greaterpart of the line. Outside of this intrenched line, and extending abouthalf the entire length of it, is a ravine running north and south andopening into Hickman creek at a point north of the fort.  The entireside of this ravine next to the works was one long abatis.General Halleck commenced his efforts in all quarters to getreinforcements to forward to me immediately on my departure from Cairo.General Hunter sent men freely from Kansas, and a large division underGeneral Nelson, from Buell's army, was also dispatched.  Orders went outfrom the War Department to consolidate fragments of companies that werebeing recruited in the Western States so as to make full companies, andto consolidate companies into regiments.  General Halleck did notapprove or disapprove of my going to Fort Donelson.  He said nothingwhatever to me on the subject.  He informed Buell on the 7th that Iwould march against Fort Donelson the next day; but on the 10th hedirected me to fortify Fort Henry strongly, particularly to the landside, saying that he forwarded me intrenching tools for that purpose.  Ireceived this dispatch in front of Fort Donelson.I was very impatient to get to Fort Donelson because I knew theimportance of the place to the enemy and supposed he would reinforce itrapidly.  I felt that 15,000 men on the 8th would be more effective than50,000 a month later.  I asked Flag-officer Foote, therefore, to orderhis gunboats still about Cairo to proceed up the Cumberland River andnot to wait for those gone to Eastport and  Florence; but the others gotback in time and we started on the 12th.  I had moved McClernand out afew miles the night before so as to leave the road as free as possible.Just as we were about to start the first reinforcement reached me ontransports.  It was a brigade composed of six full regiments commandedby Colonel Thayer, of Nebraska.  As the gunboats were going around toDonelson by the Tennessee, Ohio and Cumberland rivers, I directed Thayerto turn about and go under their convoy.I started from Fort Henry with 15,000 men, including eight batteries andpart of a regiment of cavalry, and, meeting with no obstruction todetain us, the advance arrived in front of the enemy by noon.  Thatafternoon and the next day were spent in taking up ground to make theinvestment as complete as possible.  General Smith had been directed toleave a portion of his division behind to guard forts Henry and Heiman.He left General Lew. Wallace with 2,500 men.  With the remainder of hisdivision he occupied our left, extending to Hickman creek. McClernandwas on the right and covered the roads running south and south-west fromDover.  His right extended to the back-water up the ravine opening intothe Cumberland south of the village. The troops were not intrenched, butthe nature of the ground was such that they were just as well protectedfrom the fire of the enemy as if rifle-pits had been thrown up.  Ourline was generally along the crest of ridges.  The artillery wasprotected by being sunk in the ground.  The men who were not serving theguns were perfectly covered from fire on taking position a little backfrom the crest.  The greatest suffering was from want of shelter.  Itwas midwinter and during the siege we had rain and snow, thawing andfreezing alternately.  It would not do to allow camp-fires except fardown the hill out of sight of the enemy, and it would not do to allowmany of the troops to remain there at the same time.  In the march overfrom Fort Henry numbers of the men had thrown away their blankets andovercoats.  There was therefore much discomfort and absolute suffering.During the 12th and 13th, and until the arrival of Wallace and Thayer onthe 14th, the National forces, composed of but 15,000 men, withoutintrenchments, confronted an intrenched army of 21,000, without conflictfurther than what was brought on by ourselves.  Only one gunboat hadarrived.  There was a little skirmishing each day, brought on by themovement of our troops in securing commanding positions; but there wasno actual fighting during this time except once, on the 13th, in frontof McClernand's command.  That general had undertaken to capture abattery of the enemy which was annoying his men.  Without orders orauthority he sent three regiments to make the assault.  The battery wasin the main line of the enemy, which was defended by his whole armypresent.  Of course the assault was a failure, and of course the loss onour side was great for the number of men engaged.  In this assaultColonel William Morrison fell badly wounded.  Up to this time thesurgeons with the army had no difficulty in finding room in the housesnear our line for all the sick and wounded; but now hospitals wereovercrowded. Owing, however, to the energy and skill of the surgeons thesuffering was not so great as it might have been.  The hospitalarrangements at Fort Donelson were as complete as it was possible tomake them, considering the inclemency of the weather and the lack oftents, in a sparsely settled country where the houses were generally ofbut one or two rooms.On the return of Captain Walke to Fort Henry on the 10th, I hadrequested him to take the vessels that had accompanied him on hisexpedition up the Tennessee, and get possession of the Cumberland as farup towards Donelson as possible.  He started without delay, taking,however, only his own gunboat, the Carondelet, towed by the steamerAlps.  Captain Walke arrived a few miles below Donelson on the 12th, alittle after noon. About the time the advance of troops reached a pointwithin gunshot of the fort on the land side, he engaged the waterbatteries at long range.  On the 13th I informed him of my arrival theday before and of the establishment of most of our batteries, requestinghim at the same time to attack again that day so that I might takeadvantage of any diversion.  The attack was made and many shots fellwithin the fort, creating some consternation, as we now know.  Theinvestment on the land side was made as complete as the number of troopsengaged would admit of.During the night of the 13th Flag-officer Foote arrived with theiron-clads St. Louis, Louisville and Pittsburg and the wooden gunboatsTyler and Conestoga, convoying Thayer's brigade.  On the morning of the14th Thayer was landed.  Wallace, whom I had ordered over from FortHenry, also arrived about the same time.  Up to this time he had beencommanding a brigade belonging to the division of General C. F. Smith.These troops were now restored to the division they belonged to, andGeneral Lew. Wallace was assigned to the command of a division composedof the brigade of Colonel Thayer and other reinforcements that arrivedthe same day.  This new division was assigned to the centre, giving thetwo flanking divisions an opportunity to close up and form a strongerline.The plan was for the troops to hold the enemy within his lines, whilethe gunboats should attack the water batteries at close quarters andsilence his guns if possible.  Some of the gunboats were to run thebatteries, get above the fort and above the village of Dover.  I hadordered a reconnoissance made with the view of getting troops to theriver above Dover in case they should be needed there.  That positionattained by the gunboats it would have been but a question of time--anda very short time, too--when the garrison would have been compelled tosurrender.By three in the afternoon of the 14th Flag-officer Foote was ready, andadvanced upon the water batteries with his entire fleet.  After comingin range of the batteries of the enemy the advance was slow, but aconstant fire was delivered from every gun that could be brought to bearupon the fort.  I occupied a position on shore from which I could seethe advancing navy. The leading boat got within a very short distance ofthe water battery, not further off I think than two hundred yards, and Isoon saw one and then another of them dropping down the river, visiblydisabled.  Then the whole fleet followed and the engagement closed forthe day.  The gunboat which Flag-officer Foote was on, besides havingbeen hit about sixty times, several of the shots passing through nearthe waterline, had a shot enter the pilot-house which killed the pilot,carried away the wheel and wounded the flag-officer himself.  Thetiller-ropes of another vessel were carried away and she, too, droppedhelplessly back.  Two others had their pilot-houses so injured that theyscarcely formed a protection to the men at the wheel.The enemy had evidently been much demoralized by the assault, but theywere jubilant when they saw the disabled vessels dropping down the riverentirely out of the control of the men on board.  Of course I onlywitnessed the falling back of our gunboats and felt sad enough at thetime over the repulse. Subsequent reports, now published, show that theenemy telegraphed a great victory to Richmond.  The sun went down on thenight of the 14th of February, 1862, leaving the army confronting FortDonelson anything but comforted over the prospects.  The weather hadturned intensely cold; the men were without tents and could not keep upfires where most of them had to stay, and, as previously stated, manyhad thrown away their overcoats and blankets.  Two of the strongest ofour gunboats had been disabled, presumably beyond the possibility ofrendering any present assistance.  I retired this night not knowing butthat I would have to intrench my position, and bring up tents for themen or build huts under the cover of the hills.On the morning of the 15th, before it was yet broad day, a messengerfrom Flag-officer Foote handed me a note, expressing a desire to see meon the flag-ship and saying that he had been injured the day before somuch that he could not come himself to me.  I at once made mypreparations for starting.  I directed my adjutant-general to notifyeach of the division commanders of my absence and instruct them to donothing to bring on an engagement until they received further orders,but to hold their positions.  From the heavy rains that had fallen fordays and weeks preceding and from the constant use of the roads betweenthe troops and the landing four to seven miles below, these roads hadbecome cut up so as to be hardly passable.  The intense cold of thenight of the 14th-15th had frozen the ground solid.  This made travel onhorseback even slower than through the mud; but I went as fast as theroads would allow.When I reached the fleet I found the flag-ship was anchored out in thestream.  A small boat, however, awaited my arrival and I was soon onboard with the flag-officer.  He explained to me in short the conditionin which he was left by the engagement of the evening before, andsuggested that I should intrench while he returned to Mound City withhis disabled boats, expressing at the time the belief that he could havethe necessary repairs made and be back in ten days.  I saw the absolutenecessity of his gunboats going into hospital and did not know but Ishould be forced to the alternative of going through a siege.  But theenemy relieved me from this necessity.When I left the National line to visit Flag-officer Foote I had no ideathat there would be any engagement on land unless I brought it onmyself.  The conditions for battle were much more favorable to us thanthey had been for the first two days of the investment.  From the 12thto the 14th we had but 15,000 men of all arms and no gunboats.  Now wehad been reinforced by a fleet of six naval vessels, a large division oftroops under General L. Wallace and 2,500 men brought over from FortHenry belonging to the division of C. F. Smith.  The enemy, however, hadtaken the initiative.  Just as I landed I met Captain Hillyer of mystaff, white with fear, not for his personal safety, but for the safetyof the National troops.  He said the enemy had come out of his lines infull force and attacked and scattered McClernand's division, which wasin full retreat.  The roads, as I have said, were unfit for making fasttime, but I got to my command as soon as possible.  The attack had beenmade on the National right.  I was some four or five miles north of ourleft.  The line was about three miles long.  In reaching the point wherethe disaster had occurred I had to pass the divisions of Smith andWallace.  I saw no sign of excitement on the portion of the line held bySmith; Wallace was nearer the scene of conflict and had taken part init.  He had, at an opportune time, sent Thayer's brigade to the supportof McClernand and thereby contributed to hold the enemy within hislines.I saw everything favorable for us along the line of our left and centre.When I came to the right appearances were different. The enemy had comeout in full force to cut his way out and make his escape.  McClernand'sdivision had to bear the brunt of the attack from this combined force.His men had stood up gallantly until the ammunition in theircartridge-boxes gave out.  There was abundance of ammunition near bylying on the ground in boxes, but at that stage of the war it was notall of our commanders of regiments, brigades, or even divisions, who hadbeen educated up to the point of seeing that their men were constantlysupplied with ammunition during an engagement.  When the men foundthemselves without ammunition they could not stand up against troops whoseemed to have plenty of it.  The division broke and a portion fled, butmost of the men, as they were not pursued, only fell back out of rangeof the fire of the enemy. It must have been about this time that Thayerpushed his brigade in between the enemy and those of our troops thatwere without ammunition.  At all events the enemy fell back within hisintrenchments and was there when I got on the field.I saw the men standing in knots talking in the most excited manner.  Noofficer seemed to be giving any directions.  The soldiers had theirmuskets, but no ammunition, while there were tons of it close at hand.I heard some of the men say that the enemy had come out with knapsacks,and haversacks filled with rations.  They seemed to think this indicateda determination on his part to stay out and fight just as long as theprovisions held out.  I turned to Colonel J. D. Webster, of my staff,who was with me, and said:  'Some of our men are pretty badlydemoralized, but the enemy must be more so, for he has attempted toforce his way out, but has fallen back:  the one who attacks first nowwill be victorious and the enemy will have to be in a hurry if he getsahead of me.'  I determined to make the assault at once on our left.  Itwas clear to my mind that the enemy had started to march out with hisentire force, except a few pickets, and if our attack could be made onthe left before the enemy could redistribute his forces along the line,we would find but little opposition except from the intervening abatis.I directed Colonel Webster to ride with me and call out to the men as wepassed:  'Fill your cartridge-boxes, quick, and get into line; the enemyis trying to escape and he must not be permitted to do so.'  This actedlike a charm.  The men only wanted some one to give them a command.  Werode rapidly to Smith's quarters, when I explained the situation to himand directed him to charge the enemy's works in his front with his wholedivision, saying at the same time that he would find nothing but a verythin line to contend with.  The general was off in an incredibly shorttime, going in advance himself to keep his men from firing while theywere working their way through the abatis intervening between them andthe enemy.  The outer line of rifle-pits was passed, and the night ofthe 15th General Smith, with much of his division, bivouacked within thelines of the enemy.  There was now no doubt but that the Confederatesmust surrender or be captured the next day.There seems from subsequent accounts to have been much consternation,particularly among the officers of high rank, in Dover during the nightof the 15th.  General Floyd, the commanding officer, who was a man oftalent enough for any civil position, was no soldier and, possibly, didnot possess the elements of one.  He was further unfitted for command,for the reason that his conscience must have troubled him and made himafraid.  As Secretary of War he had taken a solemn oath to maintain theConstitution of the United States and to uphold the same against all itsenemies.  He had betrayed that trust.  As Secretary of War he wasreported through the northern press to have scattered the little armythe country had so that the most of it could be picked up in detail whensecession occurred. About a year before leaving the Cabinet he hadremoved arms from northern to southern arsenals.  He continued in theCabinet of President Buchanan until about the 1st of January, 1861,while he was working vigilantly for the establishment of a confederacymade out of United States territory.  Well may he have been afraid tofall into the hands of National troops.  He would no doubt have beentried for misappropriating public property, if not for treason, had hebeen captured.  General Pillow, next in command, was conceited, andprided himself much on his services in the Mexican war.  He telegraphedto General Johnston, at Nashville, after our men were within the rebelrifle-pits, and almost on the eve of his making his escape, that theSouthern troops had had great success all day.  Johnston forwarded thedispatch to Richmond.  While the authorities at the capital were readingit Floyd and Pillow were fugitives.A council of war was held by the enemy at which all agreed that it wouldbe impossible to hold out longer.  General Buckner, who was third inrank in the garrison but much the most capable soldier, seems to haveregarded it a duty to hold the fort until the general commanding thedepartment, A. S. Johnston, should get back to his headquarters atNashville.  Buckner's report shows, however, that he considered Donelsonlost and that any attempt to hold the place longer would be at thesacrifice of the command.  Being assured that Johnston was already inNashville, Buckner too agreed that surrender was the proper thing.Floyd turned over the command to Pillow, who declined it.  It thendevolved upon Buckner, who accepted the responsibility of the position.Floyd and Pillow took possession of all the river transports at Doverand before morning both were on their way to Nashville, with the brigadeformerly commanded by Floyd and some other troops, in all about 3,000.Some marched up the east bank of the Cumberland; others went on thesteamers.  During the night Forrest also, with his cavalry and someother troops about a thousand in all, made their way out, passingbetween our right and the river.  They had to ford or swim over theback-water in the little creek just south of Dover.Before daylight General Smith brought to me the following letter fromGeneral Buckner:HEADQUARTERS, FORT DONELSON, February 16, 1862.SIR:--In consideration of all the circumstances governing the presentsituation of affairs at this station, I propose to the CommandingOfficer of the Federal forces the appointment of Commissioners to agreeupon terms of capitulation of the forces and fort under my command, andin that view suggest an armistice until 12 o'clock to-day.I am, sir, very respectfully, Your ob't se'v't, S. B. BUCKNER, Brig.Gen. C. S. A.To Brigadier-General U. S. Grant, Com'ding U. S. Forces, Near FortDonelson.To this I responded as follows:HEADQUARTERS ARMY IN THE FIELD, Camp near Donelson, February 16, 1862.General S. B. BUCKNER, Confederate Army.SIR:--Yours of this date, proposing armistice and appointment ofCommissioners to settle terms of capitulation, is just received.  Noterms except an unconditional and immediate surrender can be accepted.I propose to move immediately upon your works.I am, sir, very respectfully, Your ob't se'v't, U. S. GRANT, Brig. Gen.To this I received the following reply:HEADQUARTERS, DOVER, TENNESSEE, February 16, 1862.To Brig. Gen'l U. S. GRANT, U. S. Army.SIR:--The distribution of the forces under my command, incident to anunexpected change of commanders, and the overwhelming force under yourcommand, compel me, notwithstanding the brilliant success of theConfederate arms yesterday, to accept the ungenerous and unchivalrousterms which you propose.I am, sir, Your very ob't se'v't, S. B. BUCKNER, Brig. Gen. C. S. A.General Buckner, as soon as he had dispatched the first of the aboveletters, sent word to his different commanders on the line ofrifle-pits, notifying them that he had made a proposition looking to thesurrender of the garrison, and directing them to notify National troopsin their front so that all fighting might be prevented.  White flagswere stuck at intervals along the line of rifle-pits, but none over thefort.  As soon as the last letter from Buckner was received I mounted myhorse and rode to Dover.  General Wallace, I found, had preceded me anhour or more.  I presume that, seeing white flags exposed in his front,he rode up to see what they meant and, not being fired upon or halted,he kept on until he found himself at the headquarters of GeneralBuckner.I had been at West Point three years with Buckner and afterwards servedwith him in the army, so that we were quite well acquainted.  In thecourse of our conversation, which was very friendly, he said to me thatif he had been in command I would not have got up to Donelson as easilyas I did.  I told him that if he had been in command I should not havetried in the way I did:  I had invested their lines with a smaller forcethan they had to defend them, and at the same time had sent a brigadefull 5,000 strong, around by water; I had relied very much upon theircommander to allow me to come safely up to the outside of their works.I asked General Buckner about what force he had to surrender.  Hereplied that he could not tell with any degree of accuracy; that all thesick and weak had been sent to Nashville while we were about Fort Henry;that Floyd and Pillow had left during the night, taking many men withthem; and that Forrest, and probably others, had also escaped during thepreceding night:  the number of casualties he could not tell; but hesaid I would not find fewer than 12,000, nor more than 15,000.He asked permission to send parties outside of the lines to bury hisdead, who had fallen on the 15th when they tried to get out.  I gavedirections that his permit to pass our limits should be recognized.  Ihave no reason to believe that this privilege was abused, but itfamiliarized our guards so much with the sight of Confederates passingto and fro that I have no doubt many got beyond our pickets unobservedand went on.  The most of the men who went in that way no doubt thoughtthey had had war enough, and left with the intention of remaining out ofthe army.  Some came to me and asked permission to go, saying that theywere tired of the war and would not be caught in the ranks again, and Ibade them go.The actual number of Confederates at Fort Donelson can never be givenwith entire accuracy.  The largest number admitted by any writer on theSouthern side, is by Colonel Preston Johnston.  He gives the number at17,000.  But this must be an underestimate. The commissary general ofprisoners reported having issued rations to 14,623 Fort Donelsonprisoners at Cairo, as they passed that point.  General Pillow reportedthe killed and wounded at 2,000; but he had less opportunity of knowingthe actual numbers than the officers of McClernand's division, for mostof the killed and wounded fell outside their works, in front of thatdivision, and were buried or cared for by Buckner after the surrenderand when Pillow was a fugitive.  It is known that Floyd and Pillowescaped during the night of the 15th, taking with them not less than3,000 men.  Forrest escaped with about 1,000 and others were leavingsingly and in squads all night.  It is probable that the Confederateforce at Donelson, on the 15th of February, 1862, was 21,000 in roundnumbers.On the day Fort Donelson fell I had 27,000 men to confront theConfederate lines and guard the road four or five miles to the left,over which all our supplies had to be drawn on wagons. During the 16th,after the surrender, additional reinforcements arrived.During the siege General Sherman had been sent to Smithland, at themouth of the Cumberland River, to forward reinforcements and supplies tome.  At that time he was my senior in rank and there was no authority oflaw to assign a junior to command a senior of the same grade.  But everyboat that came up with supplies or reinforcements brought a note ofencouragement from Sherman, asking me to call upon him for anyassistance he could render and saying that if he could be of service atthe front I might send for him and he would waive rank.
ISFP	 XXIII.PROMOTED MAJOR-GENERAL OF VOLUNTEERS--UNOCCUPIED TERRITORY--ADVANCE UPONNASHVILLE--SITUATION OF THE TROOPS--CONFEDERATE RETREAT--RELIEVED OF THECOMMAND--RESTORED TO THE COMMAND--GENERAL SMITH.The news of the fall of Fort Donelson caused great delight all over theNorth.  At the South, particularly in Richmond, the effect wascorrespondingly depressing.  I was promptly promoted to the grade ofMajor-General of Volunteers, and confirmed by the Senate.  All three ofmy division commanders were promoted to the same grade and the colonelswho commanded brigades were made brigadier-generals in the volunteerservice.  My chief, who was in St. Louis, telegraphed hiscongratulations to General Hunter in Kansas for the services he hadrendered in securing the fall of Fort Donelson by sending reinforcementsso rapidly.  To Washington he telegraphed that the victory was due toGeneral C. F. Smith; 'promote him,' he said, 'and the whole country willapplaud.'  On the 19th there was published at St. Louis a formal orderthanking Flag-officer Foote and myself, and the forces under ourcommand, for the victories on the Tennessee and the Cumberland.  Ireceived no other recognition whatever from General Halleck.  ButGeneral Cullum, his chief of staff, who was at Cairo, wrote me a warmcongratulatory letter on his own behalf.  I approved of General Smith'spromotion highly, as I did all the promotions that were made.My opinion was and still is that immediately after the fall of FortDonelson the way was opened to the National forces all over theSouth-west without much resistance.  If one general who would have takenthe responsibility had been in command of all the troops west of theAlleghanies, he could have marched to Chattanooga, Corinth, Memphis andVicksburg with the troops we then had, and as volunteering was going onrapidly over the North there would soon have been force enough at allthese centres to operate offensively against any body of the enemy thatmight be found near them.  Rapid movements and the acquisition ofrebellious territory would have promoted volunteering, so thatreinforcements could have been had as fast as transportation could havebeen obtained to carry them to their destination.  On the other handthere were tens of thousands of strong able-bodied young men still attheir homes in the South-western States, who had not gone into theConfederate army in February, 1862, and who had no particular desire togo.  If our lines had been extended to protect their homes, many of themnever would have gone.  Providence ruled differently.  Time was giventhe enemy to collect armies and fortify his new positions; and twiceafterwards he came near forcing his north-western front up to the OhioRiver.I promptly informed the department commander of our success at FortDonelson and that the way was open now to Clarksville and Nashville; andthat unless I received orders to the contrary I should take Clarksvilleon the 21st and Nashville about the 1st of March.  Both these places areon the Cumberland River above Fort Donelson.  As I heard nothing fromheadquarters on the subject, General C. F. Smith was sent to Clarksvilleat the time designated and found the place evacuated.  The capture offorts Henry and Donelson had broken the line the enemy had taken fromColumbus to Bowling Green, and it was known that he was falling backfrom the eastern point of this line and that Buell was following, or atleast advancing.  I should have sent troops to Nashville at the time Isent to Clarksville, but my transportation was limited and there weremany prisoners to be forwarded north.None of the reinforcements from Buell's army arrived until the 24th ofFebruary.  Then General Nelson came up, with orders to report to me withtwo brigades, he having sent one brigade to Cairo.  I knew General Buellwas advancing on Nashville from the north, and I was advised by scoutsthat the rebels were leaving that place, and trying to get out all thesupplies they could. Nashville was, at that time, one of the bESTJrovisioned posts in the South.  I had no use for reinforcements now,and thinking Buell would like to have his troops again, I ordered Nelsonto proceed to Nashville without debarking at Fort Donelson.  I sent agunboat also as a convoy.  The Cumberland River was very high at thetime; the railroad bridge at Nashville had been burned, and all rivercraft had been destroyed, or would be before the enemy left.  Nashvilleis on the west bank of the Cumberland, and Buell was approaching fromthe east.  I thought the steamers carrying Nelson's division would beuseful in ferrying the balance of Buell's forces across.  I orderedNelson to put himself in communication with Buell as soon as possible,and if he found him more than two days off from Nashville to returnbelow the city and await orders.  Buell, however, had already arrived inperson at Edgefield, opposite Nashville, and Mitchell's division of hiscommand reached there the same day. Nelson immediately took possessionof the city.After Nelson had gone and before I had learned of Buell's arrival, Isent word to department headquarters that I should go to Nashvillemyself on the 28th if I received no orders to the contrary.  Hearingnothing, I went as I had informed my superior officer I would do.  Onarriving at Clarksville I saw a fleet of steamers at the shore--the samethat had taken Nelson's division--and troops going aboard.  I landed andcalled on the commanding officer, General C. F. Smith.  As soon as hesaw me he showed an order he had just received from Buell in thesewords:NASHVILLE, February 25, 1862.GENERAL C. F. SMITH, Commanding U. S. Forces, Clarksville.GENERAL:--The landing of a portion of our troops, contrary to myintentions, on the south side of the river has compelled me to hold thisside at every hazard.  If the enemy should assume the offensive, and Iam assured by reliable persons that in view of my position such is hisintention, my force present is altogether inadequate, consisting of only15,000 men.  I have to request you, therefore, to come forward with allthe available force under your command.  So important do I consider theoccasion that I think it necessary to give this communication all theforce of orders, and I send four boats, the Diana, Woodford, John Rain,and Autocrat, to bring you up.  In five or six days my force willprobably be sufficient to relieve you.Very respectfully, your ob't srv't, D. C. BUELL, Brigadier-GeneralComd'g.P. S.--The steamers will leave here at 12 o'clock to-night.General Smith said this order was nonsense.  But I told him it wasbetter to obey it.  The General replied, 'of course I must obey,' andsaid his men were embarking as fast as they could.  I went on up toNashville and inspected the position taken by Nelson's troops.  I didnot see Buell during the day, and wrote him a note saying that I hadbeen in Nashville since early morning and had hoped to meet him.  On myreturn to the boat we met.  His troops were still east of the river, andthe steamers that had carried Nelson's division up were mostly atClarksville to bring Smith's division.  I said to General Buell myinformation was that the enemy was retreating as fast as possible.General Buell said there was fighting going on then only ten or twelvemiles away.  I said:  'Quite probably; Nashville contained valuablestores of arms, ammunition and provisions, and the enemy is probablytrying to carry away all he can.  The fighting is doubtless with therear-guard who are trying to protect the trains they are getting awaywith.'  Buell spoke very positively of the danger Nashville was in of anattack from the enemy.  I said, in the absence of positive information,I believed my information was correct.  He responded that he 'knew.''Well,' I said, 'I do not know; but as I came by Clarksville GeneralSmith's troops were embarking to join you.'Smith's troops were returned the same day.  The enemy were trying to getaway from Nashville and not to return to it.At this time General Albert Sidney Johnston commanded all theConfederate troops west of the Alleghany Mountains, with the exceptionof those in the extreme south.  On the National side the forcesconfronting him were divided into, at first three, then four separatedepartments.  Johnston had greatly the advantage in having supremecommand over all troops that could possibly be brought to bear upon onepoint, while the forces similarly situated on the National side, dividedinto independent commands, could not be brought into harmonious actionexcept by orders from Washington.At the beginning of 1862 Johnston's troops east of the Mississippioccupied a line extending from Columbus, on his left, to Mill Springs,on his right.  As we have seen, Columbus, both banks of the TennesseeRiver, the west bank of the Cumberland and Bowling Green, all werestrongly fortified.  Mill Springs was intrenched.  The National troopsoccupied no territory south of the Ohio, except three small garrisonsalong its bank and a force thrown out from Louisville to confront thatat Bowling Green.  Johnston's strength was no doubt numerically inferiorto that of the National troops; but this was compensated for by theadvantage of being sole commander of all the Confederate forces at theWest, and of operating in a country where his friends would take care ofhis rear without any detail of soldiers.  But when General George H.Thomas moved upon the enemy at Mill Springs and totally routed him,inflicting a loss of some 300 killed and wounded, and forts Henry andHeiman fell into the hands of the National forces, with their armamentsand about 100 prisoners, those losses seemed to dishearten theConfederate commander so much that he immediately commenced a retreatfrom Bowling Green on Nashville.  He reached this latter place on the14th of February, while Donelson was still besieged.  Buell followedwith a portion of the Army of the Ohio, but he had to march and did notreach the east bank of the Cumberland opposite Nashville until the 24thof the month, and then with only one division of his army.The bridge at Nashville had been destroyed and all boats removed ordisabled, so that a small garrison could have held the place against anyNational troops that could have been brought against it within ten daysafter the arrival of the force from Bowling Green.  Johnston seemed tolie quietly at Nashville to await the result at Fort Donelson, on whichhe had staked the possession of most of the territory embraced in theStates of Kentucky and Tennessee.  It is true, the two generals seniorin rank at Fort Donelson were sending him encouraging dispatches, evenclaiming great Confederate victories up to the night of the 16th whenthey must have been preparing for their individual escape. Johnston madea fatal mistake in intrusting so important a command to Floyd, who hemust have known was no soldier even if he possessed the elements of one.Pillow's presence as second was also a mistake.  If these officers hadbeen forced upon him and designated for that particular command, then heshould have left Nashville with a small garrison under a trusty officer,and with the remainder of his force gone to Donelson himself.  If he hadbeen captured the result could not have been worse than it was.Johnston's heart failed him upon the first advance of National troops.He wrote to Richmond on the 8th of February, 'I think the gunboats ofthe enemy will probably take Fort Donelson without the necessity ofemploying their land force in cooperation.'  After the fall of thatplace he abandoned Nashville and Chattanooga without an effort to saveeither, and fell back into northern Mississippi, where, six weeks later,he was destined to end his career.From the time of leaving Cairo I was singularly unfortunate in notreceiving dispatches from General Halleck.  The order of the 10th ofFebruary directing me to fortify Fort Henry strongly, particularly tothe land side, and saying that intrenching tools had been sent for thatpurpose, reached me after Donelson was invested.  I received nothingdirect which indicated that the department commander knew we were inpossession of Donelson.  I was reporting regularly to the chief ofstaff, who had been sent to Cairo, soon after the troops left there, toreceive all reports from the front and to telegraph the substance to theSt. Louis headquarters.  Cairo was at the southern end of the telegraphwire.  Another line was started at once from Cairo to Paducah andSmithland, at the mouths of the Tennessee and Cumberland respectively.My dispatches were all sent to Cairo by boat, but many of thoseaddressed to me were sent to the operator at the end of the advancingwire and he failed to forward them.  This operator afterwards proved tobe a rebel; he deserted his post after a short time and went southtaking his dispatches with him.  A telegram from General McClellan to meof February 16th, the day of the surrender, directing me to report infull the situation, was not received at my headquarters until the 3d ofMarch.On the 2d of March I received orders dated March 1st to move my commandback to Fort Henry, leaving only a small garrison at Donelson.  FromFort Henry expeditions were to be sent against Eastport, Mississippi,and Paris, Tennessee.  We started from Donelson on the 4th, and the sameday I was back on the Tennessee River.  On March 4th I also received thefollowing dispatch from General Halleck:MAJ.-GEN. U. S. GRANT, Fort Henry:You will place Maj.-Gen. C. F. Smith in command of expedition, andremain yourself at Fort Henry.  Why do you not obey my orders to reportstrength and positions of your command?H. W. HALLECK, Major-General.I was surprised.  This was the first intimation I had received thatGeneral Halleck had called for information as to the strength of mycommand.  On the 6th he wrote to me again.  'Your going to Nashvillewithout authority, and when your presence with your troops was of theutmost importance, was a matter of very serious complaint at Washington,so much so that I was advised to arrest you on your return.'  This wasthe first I knew of his objecting to my going to Nashville.  That placewas not beyond the limits of my command, which, it had been expresslydeclared in orders, were 'not defined.'  Nashville is west of theCumberland River, and I had sent troops that had reported to me for dutyto occupy the place.  I turned over the command as directed and thenreplied to General Halleck courteously, but asked to be relieved fromfurther duty under him.Later I learned that General Halleck had been calling lustily for moretroops, promising that he would do something important if he could onlybe sufficiently reinforced.  McClellan asked him what force he then had.Halleck telegraphed me to supply the information so far as my commandwas concerned, but I received none of his dispatches.  At last Halleckreported to Washington that he had repeatedly ordered me to give thestrength of my force, but could get nothing out of me; that I had goneto Nashville, beyond the limits of my command, without his authority,and that my army was more demoralized by victory than the army at BullRun had been by defeat.  General McClellan, on this information, orderedthat I should be relieved from duty and that an investigation should bemade into any charges against me.  He even authorized my arrest.  Thusin less than two weeks after the victory at Donelson, the two leadinggenerals in the army were in correspondence as to what dispositionshould be made of me, and in less than three weeks I was virtually inarrest and without a command.On the 13th of March I was restored to command, and on the 17th Hallecksent me a copy of an order from the War Department which stated thataccounts of my misbehavior had reached Washington and directed him toinvestigate and report the facts.  He forwarded also a copy of adetailed dispatch from himself to Washington entirely exonerating me;but he did not inform me that it was his own reports that had createdall the trouble.  On the contrary, he wrote to me, 'Instead of relievingyou, I wish you, as soon as your new army is in the field, to assumeimmediate command, and lead it to new victories.'  In consequence I feltvery grateful to him, and supposed it was his interposition that had setme right with the government.  I never knew the truth until GeneralBadeau unearthed the facts in his researches for his history of mycampaigns.General Halleck unquestionably deemed General C. F. Smith a much fitterofficer for the command of all the forces in the military district thanI was, and, to render him available for such command, desired hispromotion to antedate mine and those of the other division commanders.It is probable that the general opinion was that Smith's long servicesin the army and distinguished deeds rendered him the more proper personfor such command.  Indeed I was rather inclined to this opinion myselfat that time, and would have served as faithfully under Smith as he haddone under me.  But this did not justify the dispatches which GeneralHalleck sent to Washington, or his subsequent concealment of them fromme when pretending to explain the action of my superiors.On receipt of the order restoring me to command I proceeded to Savannahon the Tennessee, to which point my troops had advanced.  General Smithwas delighted to see me and was unhesitating in his denunciation of thetreatment I had received.  He was on a sick bed at the time, from whichhe never came away alive.  His death was a severe loss to our westernarmy.  His personal courage was unquestioned, his judgment andprofessional acquirements were unsurpassed, and he had the confidenceof those he commanded as well as of those over him.
ISFP	 XXIV.THE ARMY AT PITTSBURG LANDING--INJURED BY A FALL--THE CONFEDERATE ATTACKAT SHILOH--THE FIRST DAY'S FIGHT AT SHILOH--GENERAL SHERMAN--CONDITIONOF THE ARMY--CLOSE OF THE FIRST DAY'S FIGHT--THE SECOND DAY'S FIGHT--RETREAT AND DEFEAT OF THE CONFEDERATES.When I reassumed command on the 17th of March I found the army divided,about half being on the east bank of the Tennessee at Savannah, whileone division was at Crump's landing on the west bank about four mileshigher up, and the remainder at Pittsburg landing, five miles aboveCrump's.  The enemy was in force at Corinth, the junction of the twomost important railroads in the Mississippi valley--one connectingMemphis and the Mississippi River with the East, and the other leadingsouth to all the cotton states.  Still another railroad connects Corinthwith Jackson, in west Tennessee.  If we obtained possession of Corinththe enemy would have no railroad for the transportation of armies orsupplies until that running east from Vicksburg was reached.  It was thegreat strategic position at the West between the Tennessee and theMississippi rivers and between Nashville and Vicksburg.I at once put all the troops at Savannah in motion for Pittsburglanding, knowing that the enemy was fortifying at Corinth and collectingan army there under Johnston.  It was my expectation to march againstthat army as soon as Buell, who had been ordered to reinforce me withthe Army of the Ohio, should arrive; and the west bank of the river wasthe place to start from.  Pittsburg is only about twenty miles fromCorinth, and Hamburg landing, four miles further up the river, is a mileor two nearer.  I had not been in command long before I selected Hamburgas the place to put the Army of the Ohio when it arrived.  The roadsfrom Pittsburg and Hamburg to Corinth converge some eight miles out.This disposition of the troops would have given additional roads tomarch over when the advance commenced, within supporting distance ofeach other.Before I arrived at Savannah, Sherman, who had joined the Army of theTennessee and been placed in command of a division, had made anexpedition on steamers convoyed by gunboats to the neighborhood ofEastport, thirty miles south, for the purpose of destroying the railroadeast of Corinth.  The rains had been so heavy for some time before thatthe low-lands had become impassable swamps.  Sherman debarked his troopsand started out to accomplish the object of the expedition; but theriver was rising so rapidly that the back-water up the small tributariesthreatened to cut off the possibility of getting back to the boats, andthe expedition had to return without reaching the railroad.  The gunshad to be hauled by hand through the water to get back to the boats.On the 17th of March the army on the Tennessee River consisted of fivedivisions, commanded respectively by Generals C. F. Smith, McClernand,L. Wallace, Hurlbut and Sherman.  General W. H. L. Wallace wastemporarily in command of Smith's division, General Smith, as I havesaid, being confined to his bed. Reinforcements were arriving daily andas they came up they were organized, first into brigades, then into adivision, and the command given to General Prentiss, who had beenordered to report to me.  General Buell was on his way from Nashvillewith 40,000 veterans.  On the 19th of March he was at Columbia,Tennessee, eighty-five miles from Pittsburg.  When all reinforcementsshould have arrived I expected to take the initiative by marching onCorinth, and had no expectation of needing fortifications, though thissubject was taken into consideration.  McPherson, my only militaryengineer, was directed to lay out a line to intrench.  He did so, butreported that it would have to be made in rear of the line of encampmentas it then ran.  The new line, while it would be nearer the river, wasyet too far away from the Tennessee, or even from the creeks, to beeasily supplied with water, and in case of attack these creeks would bein the hands of the enemy.  The fact is, I regarded the campaign we wereengaged in as an offensive one and had no idea that the enemy wouldleave strong intrenchments to take the initiative when he knew he wouldbe attacked where he was if he remained.  This view, however, did notprevent every precaution being taken and every effort made to keepadvised of all movements of the enemy.Johnston's cavalry meanwhile had been well out towards our front, andoccasional encounters occurred between it and our outposts.  On the 1stof April this cavalry became bold and approached our lines, showing thatan advance of some kind was contemplated.  On the 2d Johnston leftCorinth in force to attack my army.  On the 4th his cavalry dashed downand captured a small picket guard of six or seven men, stationed somefive miles out from Pittsburg on the Corinth road.  Colonel Bucklandsent relief to the guard at once and soon followed in person with anentire regiment, and General Sherman followed Buckland taking theremainder of a brigade.  The pursuit was kept up for some three milesbeyond the point where the picket guard had been captured, and afternightfall Sherman returned to camp and reported to me by letter what hadoccurred.At this time a large body of the enemy was hovering to the west of us,along the line of the Mobile and Ohio railroad.  My apprehension wasmuch greater for the safety of Crump's landing than it was forPittsburg.  I had no apprehension that the enemy could really captureeither place.  But I feared it was possible that he might make a rapiddash upon Crump's and destroy our transports and stores, most of whichwere kept at that point, and then retreat before Wallace could bereinforced.  Lew. Wallace's position I regarded as so well chosen thathe was not removed.At this time I generally spent the day at Pittsburg and returned toSavannah in the evening.  I was intending to remove my headquarters toPittsburg, but Buell was expected daily and would come in at Savannah.I remained at this point, therefore, a few days longer than I otherwiseshould have done, in order to meet him on his arrival.  The skirmishingin our front, however, had been so continuous from about the 3d of Aprilthat I did not leave Pittsburg each night until an hour when I feltthere would be no further danger before the morning.On Friday the 4th, the day of Buckland's advance, I was very muchinjured by my horse falling with me, and on me, while I was trying toget to the front where firing had been heard.  The night was one ofimpenetrable darkness, with rain pouring down in torrents; nothing wasvisible to the eye except as revealed by the frequent flashes oflightning.  Under these circumstances I had to trust to the horse,without guidance, to keep the road.  I had not gone far, however, when Imet General W. H. L. Wallace and Colonel (afterwards General) McPhersoncoming from the direction of the front.  They said all was quiet so faras the enemy was concerned.  On the way back to the boat my horse's feetslipped from under him, and he fell with my leg under his body.  Theextreme softness of the ground, from the excessive rains of the fewpreceding days, no doubt saved me from a severe injury and protractedlameness.  As it was, my ankle was very much injured, so much so that myboot had to be cut off.  For two or three days after I was unable towalk except with crutches.On the 5th General Nelson, with a division of Buell's army, arrived atSavannah and I ordered him to move up the east bank of the river, to bein a position where he could be ferried over to Crump's landing orPittsburg as occasion required.  I had learned that General Buellhimself would be at Savannah the next day, and desired to meet me on hisarrival.  Affairs at Pittsburg landing had been such for several daysthat I did not want to be away during the day.  I determined, therefore,to take a very early breakfast and ride out to meet Buell, and thus savetime.  He had arrived on the evening of the 5th, but had not advised meof the fact and I was not aware of it until some time after.  While Iwas at breakfast, however, heavy firing was heard in the direction ofPittsburg landing, and I hastened there, sending a hurried note to Buellinforming him of the reason why I could not meet him at Savannah.  Onthe way up the river I directed the dispatch-boat to run in close toCrump's landing, so that I could communicate with General Lew. Wallace.I found him waiting on a boat apparently expecting to see me, and Idirected him to get his troops in line ready to execute any orders hemight receive.  He replied that his troops were already under arms andprepared to move.Up to that time I had felt by no means certain that Crump's landingmight not be the point of attack.  On reaching the front, however, abouteight A.M., I found that the attack on Pittsburg was unmistakable, andthat nothing more than a small guard, to protect our transports andstores, was needed at Crump's.  Captain Baxter, a quartermaster on mystaff, was accordingly directed to go back and order General Wallace tomarch immediately to Pittsburg by the road nearest the river. CaptainBaxter made a memorandum of this order.  About one P.M., not hearingfrom Wallace and being much in need of reinforcements, I sent two moreof my staff, Colonel McPherson and Captain Rowley, to bring him up withhis division.  They reported finding him marching towards Purdy, Bethel,or some point west from the river, and farther from Pittsburg by severalmiles than when he started.  The road from his first position toPittsburg landing was direct and near the river.  Between the two pointsa bridge had been built across Snake Creek by our troops, at whichWallace's command had assisted, expressly to enable the troops at thetwo places to support each other in case of need.  Wallace did notarrive in time to take part in the first day's fight.  General Wallacehas since claimed that the order delivered to him by Captain Baxter wassimply to join the right of the army, and that the road over which hemarched would have taken him to the road from Pittsburg to Purdy whereit crosses Owl Creek on the right of Sherman; but this is not where Ihad ordered him nor where I wanted him to go.I never could see and do not now see why any order was necessary furtherthan to direct him to come to Pittsburg landing, without specifying bywhat route.  His was one of three veteran divisions that had been inbattle, and its absence was severely felt.  Later in the war GeneralWallace would not have made the mistake that he committed on the 6th ofApril, 1862.  I presume his idea was that by taking the route he did hewould be able to come around on the flank or rear of the enemy, and thusperform an act of heroism that would redound to the credit of hiscommand, as well as to the benefit of his country.Some two or three miles from Pittsburg landing was a log meeting-housecalled Shiloh.  It stood on the ridge which divides the waters of Snakeand Lick creeks, the former emptying into the Tennessee just north ofPittsburg landing, and the latter south.  This point was the key to ourposition and was held by Sherman.  His division was at that time whollyraw, no part of it ever having been in an engagement; but I thought thisdeficiency was more than made up by the superiority of the commander.McClernand was on Sherman's left, with troops that had been engaged atforts Henry and Donelson and were therefore veterans so far as westerntroops had become such at that stage of the war.  Next to McClernandcame Prentiss with a raw division, and on the extreme left, Stuart withone brigade of Sherman's division.  Hurlbut was in rear of Prentiss,massed, and in reserve at the time of the onset.  The division ofGeneral C. F. Smith was on the right, also in reserve.  General Smithwas still sick in bed at Savannah, but within hearing of our guns.  Hisservices would no doubt have been of inestimable value had his healthpermitted his presence.  The command of his division devolved uponBrigadier-General W. H. L. Wallace, a most estimable and able officer; aveteran too, for he had served a year in the Mexican war and had beenwith his command at Henry and Donelson.  Wallace was mortally wounded inthe first day's engagement, and with the change of commanders thusnecessarily effected in the heat of battle the efficiency of hisdivision was much weakened.The position of our troops made a continuous line from Lick Creek on theleft to Owl Creek, a branch of Snake Creek, on the right, facing nearlysouth and possibly a little west.  The water in all these streams wasvery high at the time and contributed to protect our flanks.  The enemywas compelled, therefore, to attack directly in front.  This he did withgreat vigor, inflicting heavy losses on the National side, but sufferingmuch heavier on his own.The Confederate assaults were made with such a disregard of losses ontheir own side that our line of tents soon fell into their hands.  Theground on which the battle was fought was undulating, heavily timberedwith scattered clearings, the woods giving some protection to the troopson both sides.  There was also considerable underbrush.  A number ofattempts were made by the enemy to turn our right flank, where Shermanwas posted, but every effort was repulsed with heavy loss.  But thefront attack was kept up so vigorously that, to prevent the success ofthese attempts to get on our flanks, the National troops were compelled,several times, to take positions to the rear nearer Pittsburg landing.When the firing ceased at night the National line was all of a mile inrear of the position it had occupied in the morning.In one of the backward moves, on the 6th, the division commanded byGeneral Prentiss did not fall back with the others.  This left hisflanks exposed and enabled the enemy to capture him with about 2,200 ofhis officers and men.  General Badeau gives four o'clock of the 6th asabout the time this capture took place. He may be right as to the time,but my recollection is that the hour was later.  General Prentisshimself gave the hour as half-past five.  I was with him, as I was witheach of the division commanders that day, several times, and myrecollection is that the last time I was with him was about half-pastfour, when his division was standing up firmly and the General was ascool as if expecting victory.  But no matter whether it was four orlater, the story that he and his command were surprised and captured intheir camps is without any foundation whatever.  If it had been true, ascurrently reported at the time and yet believed by thousands of people,that Prentiss and his division had been captured in their beds, therewould not have been an all-day struggle, with the loss of thousandskilled and wounded on the Confederate side.With the single exception of a few minutes after the capture ofPrentiss, a continuous and unbroken line was maintained all day fromSnake Creek or its tributaries on the right to Lick Creek or theTennessee on the left above Pittsburg.There was no hour during the day when there was not heavy firing andgenerally hard fighting at some point on the line, but seldom at allpoints at the same time.  It was a case of Southern dash againstNorthern pluck and endurance.  Three of the five divisions engaged onSunday were entirely raw, and many of the men had only received theirarms on the way from their States to the field.  Many of them hadarrived but a day or two before and were hardly able to load theirmuskets according to the manual.  Their officers were equally ignorantof their duties. Under these circumstances it is not astonishing thatmany of the regiments broke at the first fire.  In two cases, as I nowremember, colonels led their regiments from the field on first hearingthe whistle of the enemy's bullets.  In these cases the colonels wereconstitutional cowards, unfit for any military position; but not so theofficers and men led out of danger by them.  Better troops never wentupon a battle-field than many of these, officers and men, afterwardsproved themselves to be, who fled panic stricken at the first whistle ofbullets and shell at Shiloh.During the whole of Sunday I was continuously engaged in passing fromone part of the field to another, giving directions to divisioncommanders.  In thus moving along the line, however, I never deemed itimportant to stay long with Sherman.  Although his troops were thenunder fire for the first time, their commander, by his constant presencewith them, inspired a confidence in officers and men that enabled themto render services on that bloody battle-field worthy of the best ofveterans.  McClernand was next to Sherman, and the hardest fighting wasin front of these two divisions.  McClernand told me on that day, the6th, that he profited much by having so able a commander supporting him.A casualty to Sherman that would have taken him from the field that daywould have been a sad one for the troops engaged at Shiloh.  And hownear we came to this! On the 6th Sherman was shot twice, once in thehand, once in the shoulder, the ball cutting his coat and making aslight wound, and a third ball passed through his hat.  In addition tothis he had several horses shot during the day.The nature of this battle was such that cavalry could not be used infront; I therefore formed ours into line in rear, to stop stragglers--ofwhom there were many.  When there would be enough of them to make ashow, and after they had recovered from their fright, they would be sentto reinforce some part of the line which needed support, without regardto their companies, regiments or brigades.On one occasion during the day I rode back as far as the river and metGeneral Buell, who had just arrived; I do not remember the hour, but atthat time there probably were as many as four or five thousandstragglers lying under cover of the river bluff, panic-stricken, most ofwhom would have been shot where they lay, without resistance, beforethey would have taken muskets and marched to the front to protectthemselves.  This meeting between General Buell and myself was on thedispatch-boat used to run between the landing and Savannah.  It wasbrief, and related specially to his getting his troops over the river.As we left the boat together, Buell's attention was attracted by the menlying under cover of the river bank.  I saw him berating them and tryingto shame them into joining their regiments.  He even threatened themwith shells from the gunboats near by.  But it was all to no effect.Most of these men afterward proved themselves as gallant as any of thosewho saved the battle from which they had deserted.  I have no doubt thatthis sight impressed General Buell with the idea that a line of retreatwould be a good thing just then.  If he had come in by the front insteadof through the stragglers in the rear, he would have thought and feltdifferently.  Could he have come through the Confederate rear, he wouldhave witnessed there a scene similar to that at our own.  The distantrear of an army engaged in battle is not the best place from which tojudge correctly what is going on in front.  Later in the war, whileoccupying the country between the Tennessee and the Mississippi, Ilearned that the panic in the Confederate lines had not differed muchfrom that within our own.  Some of the country people estimated thestragglers from Johnston's army as high as 20,000.  Of course this wasan exaggeration.The situation at the close of Sunday was as follows:  along the top ofthe bluff just south of the log-house which stood at Pittsburg landing,Colonel J. D. Webster, of my staff, had arranged twenty or more piecesof artillery facing south or up the river.  This line of artillery wason the crest of a hill overlooking a deep ravine opening into theTennessee.  Hurlbut with his division intact was on the right of thisartillery, extending west and possibly a little north.  McClernand camenext in the general line, looking more to the west.  His division wascomplete in its organization and ready for any duty.  Sherman came next,his right extending to Snake Creek. His command, like the other two, wascomplete in its organization and ready, like its chief, for any serviceit might be called upon to render.  All three divisions were, as amatter of course, more or less shattered and depleted in numbers fromthe terrible battle of the day.  The division of W. H. L. Wallace, asmuch from the disorder arising from changes of division and brigadecommanders, under heavy fire, as from any other cause, had lost itsorganization and did not occupy a place in the line as a division.Prentiss' command was gone as a division, many of its members havingbeen killed, wounded or captured, but it had rendered valiant servicesbefore its final dispersal, and had contributed a good share to thedefence of Shiloh.The right of my line rested near the bank of Snake Creek, a shortdistance above the bridge which had been built by the troops for thepurpose of connecting Crump's landing and Pittsburg landing.  Shermanhad posted some troops in a log-house and out-buildings which overlookedboth the bridge over which Wallace was expected and the creek above thatpoint.  In this last position Sherman was frequently attacked beforenight, but held the point until he voluntarily abandoned it to advancein order to make room for Lew. Wallace, who came up after dark.There was, as I have said, a deep ravine in front of our left. TheTennessee River was very high and there was water to a considerabledepth in the ravine.  Here the enemy made a last desperate effort toturn our flank, but was repelled.  The gunboats Tyler and Lexington,Gwin and Shirk commanding, with the artillery under Webster, aided thearmy and effectually checked their further progress.  Before any ofBuell's troops had reached the west bank of the Tennessee, firing hadalmost entirely ceased; anything like an attempt on the part of theenemy to advance had absolutely ceased.  There was some artillery firingfrom an unseen enemy, some of his shells passing beyond us; but I do notremember that there was the whistle of a single musket-ball heard.  Ashis troops arrived in the dusk General Buell marched several of hisregiments part way down the face of the hill where they fired brisklyfor some minutes, but I do not think a single man engaged in this firingreceived an injury.  The attack had spent its force.General Lew. Wallace, with 5,000 effective men, arrived after firing hadceased for the day, and was placed on the right. Thus night came,Wallace came, and the advance of Nelson's division came; but none--unless night--in time to be of material service to the gallant men whosaved Shiloh on that first day against large odds.  Buell's loss on the6th of April was two men killed and one wounded, all members of the 36thIndiana infantry.  The Army of the Tennessee lost on that day at least7,000 men.  The presence of two or three regiments of Buell's army onthe west bank before firing ceased had not the slightest effect inpreventing the capture of Pittsburg landing.So confident was I before firing had ceased on the 6th that the next daywould bring victory to our arms if we could only take the initiative,that I visited each division commander in person before anyreinforcements had reached the field.  I directed them to throw outheavy lines of skirmishers in the morning as soon as they could see, andpush them forward until they found the enemy, following with theirentire divisions in supporting distance, and to engage the enemy as soonas found.  To Sherman I told the story of the assault at Fort Donelson,and said that the same tactics would win at Shiloh.  Victory was assuredwhen Wallace arrived, even if there had been no other support.  I wasglad, however, to see the reinforcements of Buell and credit them withdoing all there was for them to do.During the night of the 6th the remainder of Nelson's division, Buell'sarmy crossed the river and were ready to advance in the morning, formingthe left wing.  Two other divisions, Crittenden's and McCook's, came upthe river from Savannah in the transports and were on the west bankearly on the 7th. Buell commanded them in person.  My command was thusnearly doubled in numbers and efficiency.During the night rain fell in torrents and our troops were exposed tothe storm without shelter.  I made my headquarters under a tree a fewhundred yards back from the river bank.  My ankle was so much swollenfrom the fall of my horse the Friday night preceding, and the bruise wasso painful, that I could get no rest.The drenching rain would have precluded the possibility of sleep withoutthis additional cause.  Some time after midnight, growing restive underthe storm and the continuous pain, I moved back to the log-house underthe bank.  This had been taken as a hospital, and all night wounded menwere being brought in, their wounds dressed, a leg or an arm amputatedas the case might require, and everything being done to save life oralleviate suffering.  The sight was more unendurable than encounteringthe enemy's fire, and I returned to my tree in the rain.The advance on the morning of the 7th developed the enemy in the campsoccupied by our troops before the battle began, more than a mile backfrom the most advanced position of the Confederates on the day before.It is known now that they had not yet learned of the arrival of Buell'scommand.  Possibly they fell back so far to get the shelter of our tentsduring the rain, and also to get away from the shells that were droppedupon them by the gunboats every fifteen minutes during the night.The position of the Union troops on the morning of the 7th was asfollows:  General Lew. Wallace on the right; Sherman on his left; thenMcClernand and then Hurlbut.  Nelson, of Buell's army, was on ourextreme left, next to the river.Crittenden was next in line after Nelson and on his right, McCookfollowed and formed the extreme right of Buell's command.  My oldcommand thus formed the right wing, while the troops directly underBuell constituted the left wing of the army.  These relative positionswere retained during the entire day, or until the enemy was driven fromthe field.In a very short time the battle became general all along the line.  Thisday everything was favorable to the Union side.  We had now become theattacking party.  The enemy was driven back all day, as we had been theday before, until finally he beat a precipitate retreat.  The last pointheld by him was near the road leading from the landing to Corinth, onthe left of Sherman and right of McClernand.  About three o'clock, beingnear that point and seeing that the enemy was giving way everywhereelse, I gathered up a couple of regiments, or parts of regiments, fromtroops near by, formed them in line of battle and marched them forward,going in front myself to prevent premature or long-range firing.  Atthis point there was a clearing between us and the enemy favorable forcharging, although exposed.  I knew the enemy were ready to break andonly wanted a little encouragement from us to go quickly and join theirfriends who had started earlier.  After marching to within musket-rangeI stopped and let the troops pass.  The command, CHARGE, was given, andwas executed with loud cheers and with a run; when the last of the enemybroke. (*7)
ISFP	 XXV.STRUCK BY A BULLET--PRECIPITATE RETREAT OF THE CONFEDERATES--INTRENCHMENTS AT SHILOH--GENERAL BUELL--GENERAL JOHNSTON--REMARKS ONSHILOH.During this second day of the battle I had been moving from right toleft and back, to see for myself the progress made.  In the early partof the afternoon, while riding with Colonel McPherson and Major Hawkins,then my chief commissary, we got beyond the left of our troops.  We weremoving along the northern edge of a clearing, very leisurely, toward theriver above the landing.  There did not appear to be an enemy to ourright, until suddenly a battery with musketry opened upon us from theedge of the woods on the other side of the clearing. The shells andballs whistled about our ears very fast for about a minute.  I do notthink it took us longer than that to get out of range and out of sight.In the sudden start we made, Major Hawkins lost his hat.  He did notstop to pick it up.  When we arrived at a perfectly safe position wehalted to take an account of damages.  McPherson's horse was panting asif ready to drop.  On examination it was found that a ball had struckhim forward of the flank just back of the saddle, and had gone entirelythrough.  In a few minutes the poor beast dropped dead; he had given nosign of injury until we came to a stop.  A ball had struck the metalscabbard of my sword, just below the hilt, and broken it nearly off;before the battle was over it had broken off entirely.  There werethree of us:  one had lost a horse, killed; one a hat and one asword-scabbard.  All were thankful that it was no worse.After the rain of the night before and the frequent and heavy rains forsome days previous, the roads were almost impassable.  The enemycarrying his artillery and supply trains over them in his retreat, madethem still worse for troops following.  I wanted to pursue, but had notthe heart to order the men who had fought desperately for two days,lying in the mud and rain whenever not fighting, and I did (*8) not feeldisposed to positively order Buell, or any part of his command, topursue.  Although the senior in rank at the time I had been so only afew weeks.  Buell was, and had been for some time past, a departmentcommander, while I commanded only a district.  I did not meet Buell inperson until too late to get troops ready and pursue with effect; buthad I seen him at the moment of the last charge I should have at leastrequested him to follow.I rode forward several miles the day after the battle, and found thatthe enemy had dropped much, if not all, of their provisions, someammunition and the extra wheels of their caissons, lightening theirloads to enable them to get off their guns. About five miles out wefound their field hospital abandoned. An immediate pursuit must haveresulted in the capture of a considerable number of prisoners andprobably some guns.Shiloh was the severest battle fought at the West during the war, andbut few in the East equalled it for hard, determined fighting.  I saw anopen field, in our possession on the second day, over which theConfederates had made repeated charges the day before, so covered withdead that it would have been possible to walk across the clearing, inany direction, stepping on dead bodies, without a foot touching theground.  On our side National and Confederate troops were mingledtogether in about equal proportions; but on the remainder of the fieldnearly all were Confederates.  On one part, which had evidently not beenploughed for several years, probably because the land was poor, busheshad grown up, some to the height of eight or ten feet. There was not oneof these left standing unpierced by bullets. The smaller ones were allcut down.Contrary to all my experience up to that time, and to the experience ofthe army I was then commanding, we were on the defensive.  We werewithout intrenchments or defensive advantages of any sort, and more thanhalf the army engaged the first day was without experience or even drillas soldiers.  The officers with them, except the division commanders andpossibly two or three of the brigade commanders, were equallyinexperienced in war.  The result was a Union victory that gave the menwho achieved it great confidence in themselves ever after.The enemy fought bravely, but they had started out to defeat and destroyan army and capture a position.  They failed in both, with very heavyloss in killed and wounded, and must have gone back discouraged andconvinced that the 'Yankee' was not an enemy to be despised.After the battle I gave verbal instructions to division commanders tolet the regiments send out parties to bury their own dead, and to detailparties, under commissioned officers from each division, to bury theConfederate dead in their respective fronts and to report the numbers soburied.  The latter part of these instructions was not carried out byall; but they were by those sent from Sherman's division, and by some ofthe parties sent out by McClernand.  The heaviest loss sustained by theenemy was in front of these two divisions.The criticism has often been made that the Union troops should have beenintrenched at Shiloh.  Up to that time the pick and spade had been butlittle resorted to at the West.  I had, however, taken this subjectunder consideration soon after re-assuming command in the field, and, asalready stated, my only military engineer reported unfavorably.  Besidesthis, the troops with me, officers and men, needed discipline and drillmore than they did experience with the pick, shovel and axe.Reinforcements were arriving almost daily, composed of troops that hadbeen hastily thrown together into companies and regiments--fragments ofincomplete organizations, the men and officers strangers to each other.Under all these circumstances I concluded that drill and discipline wereworth more to our men than fortifications.General Buell was a brave, intelligent officer, with as muchprofessional pride and ambition of a commendable sort as I ever knew.  Ihad been two years at West Point with him, and had served with himafterwards, in garrison and in the Mexican war, several years more.  Hewas not given in early life or in mature years to forming intimateacquaintances.  He was studious by habit, and commanded the confidenceand respect of all who knew him.  He was a strict disciplinarian, andperhaps did not distinguish sufficiently between the volunteer who'enlisted for the war' and the soldier who serves in time of peace.  Onesystem embraced men who risked life for a principle, and often men ofsocial standing, competence, or wealth and independence of character.The other includes, as a rule, only men who could not do as well in anyother occupation.  General Buell became an object of harsh criticismlater, some going so far as to challenge his loyalty.  No one who knewhim ever believed him capable of a dishonorable act, and nothing couldbe more dishonorable than to accept high rank and command in war andthen betray the trust.  When I came into command of the army in 1864, Irequested the Secretary of War to restore General Buell to duty.After the war, during the summer of 1865, I travelled considerablythrough the North, and was everywhere met by large numbers of people.Every one had his opinion about the manner in which the war had beenconducted:  who among the generals had failed, how, and why.Correspondents of the press were ever on hand to hear every worddropped, and were not always disposed to report correctly what did notconfirm their preconceived notions, either about the conduct of the waror the individuals concerned in it.  The opportunity frequently occurredfor me to defend General Buell against what I believed to be most unjustcharges.  On one occasion a correspondent put in my mouth the verycharge I had so often refuted--of disloyalty.  This brought from GeneralBuell a very severe retort, which I saw in the New York World some timebefore I received the letter itself.  I could very well understand hisgrievance at seeing untrue and disgraceful charges apparently sustainedby an officer who, at the time, was at the head of the army.  I repliedto him, but not through the press.  I kept no copy of my letter, nor didI ever see it in print; neither did I receive an answer.General Albert Sidney Johnston, who commanded the Confederate forces atthe beginning of the battle, was disabled by a wound on the afternoon ofthe first day.  This wound, as I understood afterwards, was notnecessarily fatal, or even dangerous.  But he was a man who would notabandon what he deemed an important trust in the face of danger andconsequently continued in the saddle, commanding, until so exhausted bythe loss of blood that he had to be taken from his horse, and soon afterdied.  The news was not long in reaching our side and I suppose wasquite an encouragement to the National soldiers.I had known Johnston slightly in the Mexican war and later as an officerin the regular army.  He was a man of high character and ability.  Hiscontemporaries at West Point, and officers generally who came to knowhim personally later and who remained on our side, expected him to provethe most formidable man to meet that the Confederacy would produce.I once wrote that nothing occurred in his brief command of an army toprove or disprove the high estimate that had been placed upon hismilitary ability; but after studying the orders and dispatches ofJohnston I am compelled to materially modify my views of that officer'squalifications as a soldier.  My judgment now is that he was vacillatingand undecided in his actions.All the disasters in Kentucky and Tennessee were so discouraging to theauthorities in Richmond that Jefferson Davis wrote an unofficial letterto Johnston expressing his own anxiety and that of the public, andsaying that he had made such defence as was dictated by long friendship,but that in the absence of a report he needed facts.  The letter was nota reprimand in direct terms, but it was evidently as much felt as thoughit had been one.  General Johnston raised another army as rapidly as hecould, and fortified or strongly intrenched at Corinth.  He knew theNational troops were preparing to attack him in his chosen position.But he had evidently become so disturbed at the results of hisoperations that he resolved to strike out in an offensive campaign whichwould restore all that was lost, and if successful accomplish stillmore.  We have the authority of his son and biographer for saying thathis plan was to attack the forces at Shiloh and crush them; then tocross the Tennessee and destroy the army of Buell, and push the waracross the Ohio River.  The design was a bold one; but we have the sameauthority for saying that in the execution Johnston showed vacillationand indecision.  He left Corinth on the 2d of April and was not ready toattack until the 6th.  The distance his army had to march was less thantwenty miles.  Beauregard, his second in command, was opposed to theattack for two reasons: first, he thought, if let alone the Nationaltroops would attack the Confederates in their intrenchments; second, wewere in ground of our own choosing and would necessarily be intrenched.Johnston not only listened to the objection of Beauregard to an attack,but held a council of war on the subject on the morning of the 5th.  Onthe evening of the same day he was in consultation with some of hisgenerals on the same subject, and still again on the morning of the 6th.During this last consultation, and before a decision had been reached,the battle began by the National troops opening fire on the enemy. Thisseemed to settle the question as to whether there was to be any battleof Shiloh.  It also seems to me to settle the question as to whetherthere was a surprise.I do not question the personal courage of General Johnston, or hisability.  But he did not win the distinction predicted for him by manyof his friends.  He did prove that as a general he was over-estimated.General Beauregard was next in rank to Johnston and succeeded to thecommand, which he retained to the close of the battle and during thesubsequent retreat on Corinth, as well as in the siege of that place.His tactics have been severely criticised by Confederate writers, but Ido not believe his fallen chief could have done any better under thecircumstances.  Some of these critics claim that Shiloh was won whenJohnston fell, and that if he had not fallen the army under me wouldhave been annihilated or captured.  IFS defeated the Confederates atShiloh.  There is little doubt that we would have been disgracefullybeaten IF all the shells and bullets fired by us had passed harmlesslyover the enemy and IF all of theirs had taken effect.  Commandinggenerals are liable to be killed during engagements; and the fact thatwhen he was shot Johnston was leading a brigade to induce it to make acharge which had been repeatedly ordered, is evidence that there wasneither the universal demoralization on our side nor the unboundedconfidence on theirs which has been claimed.  There was, in fact, nohour during the day when I doubted the eventual defeat of the enemy,although I was disappointed that reinforcements so near at hand did notarrive at an earlier hour.The description of the battle of Shiloh given by Colonel Wm. PrestonJohnston is very graphic and well told.  The reader will imagine that hecan see each blow struck, a demoralized and broken mob of Unionsoldiers, each blow sending the enemy more demoralized than ever towardsthe Tennessee River, which was a little more than two miles away at thebeginning of the onset. If the reader does not stop to inquire why, withsuch Confederate success for more than twelve hours of hard fighting,the National troops were not all killed, captured or driven into theriver, he will regard the pen picture as perfect.  But I witnessed thefight from the National side from eight o'clock in the morning untilnight closed the contest.  I see but little in the description that Ican recognize.  The Confederate troops fought well and deservecommendation enough for their bravery and endurance on the 6th of April,without detracting from their antagonists or claiming anything more thantheir just dues.The reports of the enemy show that their condition at the end of thefirst day was deplorable; their losses in killed and wounded had beenvery heavy, and their stragglers had been quite as numerous as on theNational side, with the difference that those of the enemy left thefield entirely and were not brought back to their respective commandsfor many days.  On the Union side but few of the stragglers fell backfurther than the landing on the river, and many of these were in linefor duty on the second day.  The admissions of the highest Confederateofficers engaged at Shiloh make the claim of a victory for them absurd.The victory was not to either party until the battle was over.  It wasthen a Union victory, in which the Armies of the Tennessee and the Ohioboth participated.  But the Army of the Tennessee fought the entirerebel army on the 6th and held it at bay until near night; and nightalone closed the conflict and not the three regiments of Nelson'sdivision.The Confederates fought with courage at Shiloh, but the particular skillclaimed I could not and still cannot see; though there is nothing tocriticise except the claims put forward for it since.  But theConfederate claimants for superiority in strategy, superiority ingeneralship and superiority in dash and prowess are not so unjust to theUnion troops engaged at Shiloh as are many Northern writers.  The troopson both sides were American, and united they need not fear any foreignfoe.  It is possible that the Southern man started in with a little moredash than his Northern brother; but he was correspondingly lessenduring.The endeavor of the enemy on the first day was simply to hurl their menagainst ours--first at one point, then at another, sometimes at severalpoints at once.  This they did with daring and energy, until at nightthe rebel troops were worn out.  Our effort during the same time was tobe prepared to resist assaults wherever made.  The object of theConfederates on the second day was to get away with as much of theirarmy and material as possible.  Ours then was to drive them from ourfront, and to capture or destroy as great a part as possible of theirmen and material.  We were successful in driving them back, but not sosuccessful in captures as if farther pursuit could have been made.  Asit was, we captured or recaptured on the second day about as muchartillery as we lost on the first; and, leaving out the one greatcapture of Prentiss, we took more prisoners on Monday than the enemygained from us on Sunday.  On the 6th Sherman lost seven pieces ofartillery, McClernand six, Prentiss eight, and Hurlbut two batteries.On the 7th Sherman captured seven guns, McClernand three and the Army ofthe Ohio twenty.At Shiloh the effective strength of the Union forces on the morning ofthe 6th was 33,000 men.  Lew. Wallace brought 5,000 more afternightfall.  Beauregard reported the enemy's strength at 40,955.According to the custom of enumeration in the South, this numberprobably excluded every man enlisted as musician or detailed as guard ornurse, and all commissioned officers--everybody who did not carry amusket or serve a cannon. With us everybody in the field receiving payfrom the government is counted.  Excluding the troops who fled,panic-stricken, before they had fired a shot, there was not a timeduring the 6th when we had more than 25,000 men in line. On the 7thBuell brought 20,000 more.  Of his remaining two divisions, Thomas's didnot reach the field during the engagement; Wood's arrived before firinghad ceased, but not in time to be of much service.Our loss in the two days' fight was 1,754 killed, 8,408 wounded and2,885 missing.  Of these, 2,103 were in the Army of the Ohio.Beauregard reported a total loss of 10,699, of whom 1,728 were killed,8,012 wounded and 957 missing.  This estimate must be incorrect.  Weburied, by actual count, more of the enemy's dead in front of thedivisions of McClernand and Sherman alone than here reported, and 4,000was the estimate of the burial parties of the whole field.  Beauregardreports the Confederate force on the 6th at over 40,000, and their totalloss during the two days at 10,699; and at the same time declares thathe could put only 20,000 men in battle on the morning of the 7th.The navy gave a hearty support to the army at Shiloh, as indeed italways did both before and subsequently when I was in command.  Thenature of the ground was such, however, that on this occasion it coulddo nothing in aid of the troops until sundown on the first day.  Thecountry was broken and heavily timbered, cutting off all view of thebattle from the river, so that friends would be as much in danger fromfire from the gunboats as the foe.  But about sundown, when the Nationaltroops were back in their last position, the right of the enemy was nearthe river and exposed to the fire of the two gun-boats, which wasdelivered with vigor and effect.  After nightfall, when firing hadentirely ceased on land, the commander of the fleet informed himself,approximately, of the position of our troops and suggested the idea ofdropping a shell within the lines of the enemy every fifteen minutesduring the night.  This was done with effect, as is proved by theConfederate reports.Up to the battle of Shiloh I, as well as thousands of other citizens,believed that the rebellion against the Government would collapsesuddenly and soon, if a decisive victory could be gained over any of itsarmies.  Donelson and Henry were such victories.  An army of more than21,000 men was captured or destroyed.  Bowling Green, Columbus andHickman, Kentucky, fell in consequence, and Clarksville and Nashville,Tennessee, the last two with an immense amount of stores, also fell intoour hands.  The Tennessee and Cumberland rivers, from their mouths tothe head of navigation, were secured.  But when Confederate armies werecollected which not only attempted to hold a line farther south, fromMemphis to Chattanooga, Knoxville and on to the Atlantic, but assumedthe offensive and made such a gallant effort to regain what had beenlost, then, indeed, I gave up all idea of saving the Union except bycomplete conquest.  Up to that time it had been the policy of our army,certainly of that portion commanded by me, to protect the property ofthe citizens whose territory was invaded, without regard to theirsentiments, whether Union or Secession.  After this, however, I regardedit as humane to both sides to protect the persons of those found attheir homes, but to consume everything that could be used to support orsupply armies.  Protection was still continued over such supplies aswere within lines held by us and which we expected to continue to hold;but such supplies within the reach of Confederate armies I regarded asmuch contraband as arms or ordnance stores.  Their destruction wasaccomplished without bloodshed and tended to the same result as thedestruction of armies.  I continued this policy to the close of the war.Promiscuous pillaging, however, was discouraged and punished.Instructions were always given to take provisions and forage under thedirection of commissioned officers who should give receipts to owners,if at home, and turn the property over to officers of the quartermasteror commissary departments to be issued as if furnished from our Northerndepots.  But much was destroyed without receipts to owners, when itcould not be brought within our lines and would otherwise have gone tothe support of secession and rebellion.This policy I believe exercised a material influence in hastening theend.The battle of Shiloh, or Pittsburg landing, has been perhaps lessunderstood, or, to state the case more accurately, more persistentlymisunderstood, than any other engagement between National andConfederate troops during the entire rebellion. Correct reports of thebattle have been published, notably by Sherman, Badeau and, in a speechbefore a meeting of veterans, by General Prentiss; but all of theseappeared long subsequent to the close of the rebellion and after publicopinion had been most erroneously formed.I myself made no report to General Halleck, further than was containedin a letter, written immediately after the battle informing him that anengagement had been fought and announcing the result.  A few daysafterwards General Halleck moved his headquarters to Pittsburg landingand assumed command of the troops in the field.  Although next to him inrank, and nominally in command of my old district and army, I wasignored as much as if I had been at the most distant point of territorywithin my jurisdiction; and although I was in command of all the troopsengaged at Shiloh I was not permitted to see one of the reports ofGeneral Buell or his subordinates in that battle, until they werepublished by the War Department long after the event.  For this reason Inever made a full official report of this engagement.
ISFP	 XXVI.HALLECK ASSUMES COMMAND IN THE FIELD--THE ADVANCE UPON CORINTH--OCCUPATION OF CORINTH--THE ARMY SEPARATED.General Halleck arrived at Pittsburg landing on the 11th of April andimmediately assumed command in the field.  On the 21st General Popearrived with an army 30,000 strong, fresh from the capture of IslandNumber Ten in the Mississippi River.  He went into camp at Hamburglanding five miles above Pittsburg. Halleck had now three armies:  theArmy of the Ohio, Buell commanding; the Army of the Mississippi, Popecommanding; and the Army of the Tennessee.  His orders divided thecombined force into the right wing, reserve, centre and left wing.Major-General George H. Thomas, who had been in Buell's army, wastransferred with his division to the Army of the Tennessee and givencommand of the right wing, composed of all of that army exceptMcClernand's and Lew. Wallace's divisions. McClernand was assigned tothe command of the reserve, composed of his own and Lew. Wallace'sdivisions.  Buell commanded the centre, the Army of the Ohio; and Popethe left wing, the Army of the Mississippi.  I was named second incommand of the whole, and was also supposed to be in command of theright wing and reserve.Orders were given to all the commanders engaged at Shiloh to send intheir reports without delay to department headquarters.  Those fromofficers of the Army of the Tennessee were sent through me; but from theArmy of the Ohio they were sent by General Buell without passing throughmy hands.  General Halleck ordered me, verbally, to send in my report,but I positively declined on the ground that he had received the reportsof a part of the army engaged at Shiloh without their coming through me.He admitted that my refusal was justifiable under the circumstances, butexplained that he had wanted to get the reports off before moving thecommand, and as fast as a report had come to him he had forwarded it toWashington.Preparations were at once made upon the arrival of the new commander foran advance on Corinth.  Owl Creek, on our right, was bridged, andexpeditions were sent to the north-west and west to ascertain if ourposition was being threatened from those quarters; the roads towardsCorinth were corduroyed and new ones made; lateral roads were alsoconstructed, so that in case of necessity troops marching by differentroutes could reinforce each other.  All commanders were cautionedagainst bringing on an engagement and informed in so many words that itwould be better to retreat than to fight.  By the 30th of April allpreparations were complete; the country west to the Mobile and Ohiorailroad had been reconnoitred, as well as the road to Corinth as far asMonterey twelve miles from Pittsburg. Everywhere small bodies of theenemy had been encountered, but they were observers and not in force tofight battles.Corinth, Mississippi, lies in a south-westerly direction from Pittsburglanding and about nineteen miles away as the bird would fly, butprobably twenty-two by the nearest wagon-road. It is about four milessouth of the line dividing the States of Tennessee and Mississippi, andat the junction of the Mississippi and Chattanooga railroad with theMobile and Ohio road which runs from Columbus to Mobile.  From Pittsburgto Corinth the land is rolling, but at no point reaching an elevationthat makes high hills to pass over.  In 1862 the greater part of thecountry was covered with forest with intervening clearings and houses.Underbrush was dense in the low grounds along the creeks and ravines,but generally not so thick on the high land as to prevent men passingthrough with ease.  There are two small creeks running from north of thetown and connecting some four miles south, where they form Bridge Creekwhich empties into the Tuscumbia River.  Corinth is on the ridge betweenthese streams and is a naturally strong defensive position.  The creeksare insignificant in volume of water, but the stream to the east widensout in front of the town into a swamp impassable in the presence of anenemy.  On the crest of the west bank of this stream the enemy wasstrongly intrenched.Corinth was a valuable strategic point for the enemy to hold, andconsequently a valuable one for us to possess ourselves of.  We ought tohave seized it immediately after the fall of Donelson and Nashville,when it could have been taken without a battle, but failing then itshould have been taken, without delay on the concentration of troops atPittsburg landing after the battle of Shiloh.  In fact the arrival ofPope should not have been awaited.  There was no time from the battle ofShiloh up to the evacuation of Corinth when the enemy would not haveleft if pushed.  The demoralization among the Confederates from theirdefeats at Henry and Donelson; their long marches from Bowling Green,Columbus, and Nashville, and their failure at Shiloh; in fact fromhaving been driven out of Kentucky and Tennessee, was so great that astand for the time would have been impossible.  Beauregard madestrenuous efforts to reinforce himself and partially succeeded.  Heappealed to the people of the South-west for new regiments, and receiveda few.  A. S. Johnston had made efforts to reinforce in the samequarter, before the battle of Shiloh, but in a different way.  He hadnegroes sent out to him to take the place of teamsters, company cooksand laborers in every capacity, so as to put all his white men into theranks.  The people, while willing to send their sons to the field, werenot willing to part with their negroes.  It is only fair to state thatthey probably wanted their blacks to raise supplies for the army and forthe families left at home.Beauregard, however, was reinforced by Van Dorn immediately after Shilohwith 17,000 men.  Interior points, less exposed, were also depleted toadd to the strength at Corinth.  With these reinforcements and the newregiments, Beauregard had, during the month of May, 1862, a large forceon paper, but probably not much over 50,000 effective men.  We estimatedhis strength at 70,000.  Our own was, in round numbers, 120,000. Thedefensible nature of the ground at Corinth, and the fortifications, made50,000 then enough to maintain their position against double that numberfor an indefinite time but for the demoralization spoken of.On the 30th of April the grand army commenced its advance from Shilohupon Corinth.  The movement was a siege from the start to the close.The National troops were always behind intrenchments, except of coursethe small reconnoitring parties sent to the front to clear the way foran advance.  Even the commanders of these parties were cautioned, 'notto bring on an engagement.' 'It is better to retreat than to fight.'The enemy were constantly watching our advance, but as they were simplyobservers there were but few engagements that even threatened to becomebattles.  All the engagements fought ought to have served to encouragethe enemy.  Roads were again made in our front, and again corduroyed; aline was intrenched, and the troops were advanced to the new position.Cross roads were constructed to these new positions to enable the troopsto concentrate in case of attack.  The National armies were thoroughlyintrenched all the way from the Tennessee River to Corinth.For myself I was little more than an observer.  Orders were sent directto the right wing or reserve, ignoring me, and advances were made fromone line of intrenchments to another without notifying me.  My positionwas so embarrassing in fact that I made several applications during thesiege to be relieved.General Halleck kept his headquarters generally, if not all the time,with the right wing.  Pope being on the extreme left did not see so muchof his chief, and consequently got loose as it were at times.  On the 3dof May he was at Seven Mile Creek with the main body of his command, butthrew forward a division to Farmington, within four miles of Corinth.His troops had quite a little engagement at Farmington on that day, butcarried the place with considerable loss to the enemy.  There would thenhave been no difficulty in advancing the centre and right so as to forma new line well up to the enemy, but Pope was ordered back to conformwith the general line.  On the 8th of May he moved again, taking hiswhole force to Farmington, and pushed out two divisions close to therebel line.  Again he was ordered back.  By the 4th of May the centreand right wing reached Monterey, twelve miles out.  Their advance wasslow from there, for they intrenched with every forward movement.  Theleft wing moved up again on the 25th of May and intrenched itself closeto the enemy.  The creek with the marsh before described, separated thetwo lines.  Skirmishers thirty feet apart could have maintained eitherline at this point.Our centre and right were, at this time, extended so that the right ofthe right wing was probably five miles from Corinth and four from theworks in their front.  The creek, which was a formidable obstacle foreither side to pass on our left, became a very slight obstacle on ourright.  Here the enemy occupied two positions.  One of them, as much astwo miles out from his main line, was on a commanding elevation anddefended by an intrenched battery with infantry supports.  A heavy woodintervened between this work and the National forces.  In rear to thesouth there was a clearing extending a mile or more, and south of thisclearing a log-house which had been loop-holed and was occupied byinfantry.  Sherman's division carried these two positions with some lossto himself, but with probably greater to the enemy, on the 28th of May,and on that day the investment of Corinth was complete, or as completeas it was ever made. Thomas' right now rested west of the Mobile andOhio railroad. Pope's left commanded the Memphis and Charleston railroadeast of Corinth.Some days before I had suggested to the commanding general that Ithought if he would move the Army of the Mississippi at night, by therear of the centre and right, ready to advance at daylight, Pope wouldfind no natural obstacle in his front and, I believed, no seriousartificial one.  The ground, or works, occupied by our left could beheld by a thin picket line, owing to the stream and swamp in front.  Tothe right the troops would have a dry ridge to march over.  I wassilenced so quickly that I felt that possibly I had suggested anunmilitary movement.Later, probably on the 28th of May, General Logan, whose command wasthen on the Mobile and Ohio railroad, said to me that the enemy had beenevacuating for several days and that if allowed he could go into Corinthwith his brigade.  Trains of cars were heard coming in and going out ofCorinth constantly.  Some of the men who had been engaged in variouscapacities on railroads before the war claimed that they could tell, byputting their ears to the rail, not only which way the trains weremoving but which trains were loaded and which were empty.  They saidloaded trains had been going out for several days and empty ones comingin.  Subsequent events proved the correctness of their judgment.Beauregard published his orders for the evacuation of Corinth on the26th of May and fixed the 29th for the departure of his troops, and onthe 30th of May General Halleck had his whole army drawn up prepared forbattle and announced in orders that there was every indication that ourleft was to be attacked that morning.  Corinth had already beenevacuated and the National troops marched on and took possession withoutopposition.  Everything had been destroyed or carried away.  TheConfederate commander had instructed his soldiers to cheer on thearrival of every train to create the impression among the Yankees thatreinforcements were arriving.  There was not a sick or wounded man leftby the Confederates, nor stores of any kind. Some ammunition had beenblown up--not removed--but the trophies of war were a few Quaker guns,logs of about the diameter of ordinary cannon, mounted on wheels ofwagons and pointed in the most threatening manner towards us.The possession of Corinth by the National troops was of strategicimportance, but the victory was barren in every other particular.  Itwas nearly bloodless.  It is a question whether the MORALE of theConfederate troops engaged at Corinth was not improved by the immunitywith which they were permitted to remove all public property and thenwithdraw themselves.  On our side I know officers and men of the Army ofthe Tennessee--and I presume the same is true of those of the othercommands--were disappointed at the result.  They could not see how themere occupation of places was to close the war while large and effectiverebel armies existed.  They believed that a well-directed attack wouldat least have partially destroyed the army defending Corinth.  Formyself I am satisfied that Corinth could have been captured in a twodays' campaign commenced promptly on the arrival of reinforcements afterthe battle of Shiloh.General Halleck at once commenced erecting fortifications around Corinthon a scale to indicate that this one point must be held if it took thewhole National army to do it.  All commanding points two or three milesto the south, south-east and south-west were strongly fortified.  It wasexpected in case of necessity to connect these forts by rifle-pits.They were laid out on a scale that would have required 100,000 men tofully man them.  It was probably thought that a final battle of the warwould be fought at that point.  These fortifications were never used.Immediately after the occupation of Corinth by the National troops,General Pope was sent in pursuit of the retreating garrison and GeneralBuell soon followed.  Buell was the senior of the two generals andcommanded the entire column.  The pursuit was kept up for some thirtymiles, but did not result in the capture of any material of war orprisoners, unless a few stragglers who had fallen behind and werewilling captives.  On the 10th of June the pursuing column was all backat Corinth.  The Army of the Tennessee was not engaged in any of thesemovements.The Confederates were now driven out of West Tennessee, and on the 6thof June, after a well-contested naval battle, the National forces tookpossession of Memphis and held the Mississippi river from its source tothat point.  The railroad from Columbus to Corinth was at once put ingood condition and held by us.  We had garrisons at Donelson,Clarksville and Nashville, on the Cumberland River, and held theTennessee River from its mouth to Eastport.  New Orleans and Baton Rougehad fallen into the possession of the National forces, so that now theConfederates at the west were narrowed down for all communication withRichmond to the single line of road running east from Vicksburg.  Todispossess them of this, therefore, became a matter of the firstimportance.  The possession of the Mississippi by us from Memphis toBaton Rouge was also a most important object.  It would be equal to theamputation of a limb in its weakening effects upon the enemy.After the capture of Corinth a movable force of 80,000 men, besidesenough to hold all the territory acquired, could have been set in motionfor the accomplishment of any great campaign for the suppression of therebellion.  In addition to this fresh troops were being raised to swellthe effective force.  But the work of depletion commenced.  Buell withthe Army of the Ohio was sent east, following the line of the Memphisand Charleston railroad.  This he was ordered to repair as he advanced--only to have it destroyed by small guerilla bands or other troops assoon as he was out of the way.  If he had been sent directly toChattanooga as rapidly as he could march, leaving two or three divisionsalong the line of the railroad from Nashville forward, he could havearrived with but little fighting, and would have saved much of the lossof life which was afterwards incurred in gaining Chattanooga.  Braggwould then not have had time to raise an army to contest the possessionof middle and east Tennessee and Kentucky; the battles of Stone Riverand Chickamauga would not necessarily have been fought; Burnside wouldnot have been besieged in Knoxville without the power of helping himselfor escaping; the battle of Chattanooga would not have been fought.These are the negative advantages, if the term negative is applicable,which would probably have resulted from prompt movements after Corinthfell into the possession of the National forces.  The positive resultsmight have been:  a bloodless advance to Atlanta, to Vicksburg, or toany other desired point south of Corinth in the interior of Mississippi.
ISFP	 XXVII.HEADQUARTERS MOVED TO MEMPHIS--ON THE ROAD TO MEMPHIS--ESCAPING JACKSON--COMPLAINTS AND REQUESTS--HALLECK APPOINTED COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF--RETURNTO CORINTH--MOVEMENTS OF BRAGG--SURRENDER OF CLARKSVILLE--THE ADVANCEUPON CHATTANOOGA--SHERIDAN COLONEL OF A MICHIGAN REGIMENT.My position at Corinth, with a nominal command and yet no command,became so unbearable that I asked permission of Halleck to remove myheadquarters to Memphis.  I had repeatedly asked, between the fall ofDonelson and the evacuation of Corinth, to be relieved from duty underHalleck; but all my applications were refused until the occupation ofthe town.  I then obtained permission to leave the department, butGeneral Sherman happened to call on me as I was about starting and urgedme so strongly not to think of going, that I concluded to remain.  Myapplication to be permitted to remove my headquarters to Memphis was,however, approved, and on the 21st of June I started for that point withmy staff and a cavalry escort of only a part of one company.  There wasa detachment of two or three companies going some twenty-five miles westto be stationed as a guard to the railroad.  I went under cover of thisescort to the end of their march, and the next morning proceeded to LaGrange with no convoy but the few cavalry men I had with me.From La Grange to Memphis the distance is forty-seven miles. There wereno troops stationed between these two points, except a small forceguarding a working party which was engaged in repairing the railroad.Not knowing where this party would be found I halted at La Grange.General Hurlbut was in command there at the time and had hisheadquarters tents pitched on the lawn of a very commodious countryhouse.  The proprietor was at home and, learning of my arrival, heinvited General Hurlbut and me to dine with him.  I accepted theinvitation and spent a very pleasant afternoon with my host, who was athorough Southern gentleman fully convinced of the justice of secession.After dinner, seated in the capacious porch, he entertained me with arecital of the services he was rendering the cause.  He was too old tobe in the ranks himself--he must have been quite seventy then--but hismeans enabled him to be useful in other ways.  In ordinary times thehomestead where he was now living produced the bread and meat to supplythe slaves on his main plantation, in the low-lands of Mississippi.  Nowhe raised food and forage on both places, and thought he would have thatyear a surplus sufficient to feed three hundred families of poor men whohad gone into the war and left their families dependent upon the'patriotism' of those better off.  The crops around me looked fine, andI had at the moment an idea that about the time they were ready to begathered the 'Yankee' troops would be in the neighborhood and harvestthem for the benefit of those engaged in the suppression of therebellion instead of its support.  I felt, however, the greatest respectfor the candor of my host and for his zeal in a cause he thoroughlybelieved in, though our views were as wide apart as it is possible toconceive.The 23d of June, 1862, on the road from La Grange to Memphis was verywarm, even for that latitude and season.  With my staff and small escortI started at an early hour, and before noon we arrived within twentymiles of Memphis.  At this point I saw a very comfortable-lookingwhite-haired gentleman seated at the front of his house, a littledistance from the road.  I let my staff and escort ride ahead while Ihalted and, for an excuse, asked for a glass of water.  I was invited atonce to dismount and come in.  I found my host very genial andcommunicative, and staid longer than I had intended, until the lady ofthe house announced dinner and asked me to join them.  The host,however, was not pressing, so that I declined the invitation and,mounting my horse, rode on.About a mile west from where I had been stopping a road comes up fromthe southeast, joining that from La Grange to Memphis.  A mile west ofthis junction I found my staff and escort halted and enjoying the shadeof forest trees on the lawn of a house located several hundred feet backfrom the road, their horses hitched to the fence along the line of theroad.  I, too, stopped and we remained there until the cool of theafternoon, and then rode into Memphis.The gentleman with whom I had stopped twenty miles from Memphis was aMr. De Loche, a man loyal to the Union.  He had not pressed me to tarrylonger with him because in the early part of my visit a neighbor, a Dr.Smith, had called and, on being presented to me, backed off the porch asif something had hit him.  Mr. De Loche knew that the rebel GeneralJackson was in that neighborhood with a detachment of cavalry.  Hisneighbor was as earnest in the southern cause as was Mr. De Loche inthat of the Union.  The exact location of Jackson was entirely unknownto Mr. De Loche; but he was sure that his neighbor would know it andwould give information of my presence, and this made my stay unpleasantto him after the call of Dr. Smith.I have stated that a detachment of troops was engaged in guardingworkmen who were repairing the railroad east of Memphis.  On the day Ientered Memphis, Jackson captured a small herd of beef cattle which hadbeen sent east for the troops so engaged.  The drovers were not enlistedmen and he released them.  A day or two after one of these drovers cameto my headquarters and, relating the circumstances of his capture, saidJackson was very much disappointed that he had not captured me; that hewas six or seven miles south of the Memphis and Charleston railroad whenhe learned that I was stopping at the house of Mr. De Loche, and hadridden with his command to the junction of the road he was on with thatfrom La Grange and Memphis, where he learned that I had passedthree-quarters of an hour before.  He thought it would be useless topursue with jaded horses a well-mounted party with so much of a start.Had he gone three-quarters of a mile farther he would have found me withmy party quietly resting under the shade of trees and without even armsin our hands with which to defend ourselves.General Jackson of course did not communicate his disappointment at notcapturing me to a prisoner, a young drover; but from the talk among thesoldiers the facts related were learned.  A day or two later Mr. DeLoche called on me in Memphis to apologize for his apparent incivilityin not insisting on my staying for dinner.  He said that his wifeaccused him of marked discourtesy, but that, after the call of hisneighbor, he had felt restless until I got away.  I never met GeneralJackson before the war, nor during it, but have met him since at hisvery comfortable summer home at Manitou Springs, Colorado.  I remindedhim of the above incident, and this drew from him the response that hewas thankful now he had not captured me.  I certainly was very thankfultoo.My occupation of Memphis as district headquarters did not last long.The period, however, was marked by a few incidents which were novel tome.  Up to that time I had not occupied any place in the South where thecitizens were at home in any great numbers.  Dover was within thefortifications at Fort Donelson, and, as far as I remember, everycitizen was gone.  There were no people living at Pittsburg landing, andbut very few at Corinth.  Memphis, however, was a populous city, andthere were many of the citizens remaining there who were not onlythoroughly impressed with the justice of their cause, but who thoughtthat even the 'Yankee soldiery' must entertain the same views if theycould only be induced to make an honest confession.  It took hours of mytime every day to listen to complaints and requests.  The latter weregenerally reasonable, and if so they were granted; but the complaintswere not always, or even often, well founded.  Two instances will markthe general character.  First:  the officer who commanded at Memphisimmediately after the city fell into the hands of the National troopshad ordered one of the churches of the city to be opened to thesoldiers.  Army chaplains were authorized to occupy the pulpit.  Second:at the beginning of the war the Confederate Congress had passed a lawconfiscating all property of 'alien enemies' at the South, including thedebts of Southerners to Northern men.  In consequence of this law, whenMemphis was occupied the provost-marshal had forcibly collected all theevidences he could obtain of such debts.Almost the first complaints made to me were these two outrages.  Thegentleman who made the complaints informed me first of his own highstanding as a lawyer, a citizen and a Christian.  He was a deacon in thechurch which had been defiled by the occupation of Union troops, and bya Union chaplain filling the pulpit.  He did not use the word 'defile,'but he expressed the idea very clearly.  He asked that the church berestored to the former congregation.  I told him that no order had beenissued prohibiting the congregation attending the church.  He said ofcourse the congregation could not hear a Northern clergyman who differedso radically with them on questions of government.  I told him thetroops would continue to occupy that church for the present, and thatthey would not be called upon to hear disloyal sentiments proclaimedfrom the pulpit.  This closed the argument on the first point.Then came the second.  The complainant said that he wanted the papersrestored to him which had been surrendered to the provost-marshal underprotest; he was a lawyer, and before the establishment of the'Confederate States Government' had been the attorney for a number oflarge business houses at the North; that 'his government' hadconfiscated all debts due 'alien enemies,' and appointed commissioners,or officers, to collect such debts and pay them over to the'government':  but in his case, owing to his high standing, he had beenpermitted to hold these claims for collection, the responsible officialsknowing that he would account to the 'government' for every dollarreceived. He said that his 'government,' when it came in possession ofall its territory, would hold him personally responsible for the claimshe had surrendered to the provost-marshal.  His impudence was so sublimethat I was rather amused than indignant.  I told him, however, that ifhe would remain in Memphis I did not believe the Confederate governmentwould ever molest him.  He left, no doubt, as much amazed at myassurance as I was at the brazenness of his request.On the 11th of July General Halleck received telegraphic ordersappointing him to the command of all the armies, with headquarters inWashington.  His instructions pressed him to proceed to his new field ofduty with as little delay as was consistent with the safety andinterests of his previous command.  I was next in rank, and hetelegraphed me the same day to report at department headquarters atCorinth.  I was not informed by the dispatch that my chief had beenordered to a different field and did not know whether to move myheadquarters or not.  I telegraphed asking if I was to take my staffwith me, and received word in reply:  'This place will be yourheadquarters.  You can judge for yourself.'  I left Memphis for my newfield without delay, and reached Corinth on the 15th of the month.General Halleck remained until the 17th of July; but he was veryuncommunicative, and gave me no information as to what I had been calledto Corinth for.When General Halleck left to assume the duties of general-in-chief Iremained in command of the district of West Tennessee.  Practically Ibecame a department commander, because no one was assigned to thatposition over me and I made my reports direct to the general-in-chief;but I was not assigned to the position of department commander until the25th of October.  General Halleck while commanding the Department of theMississippi had had control as far east as a line drawn from Chattanooganorth.  My district only embraced West Tennessee and Kentucky west ofthe Cumberland River.  Buell, with the Army of the Ohio, had, aspreviously stated, been ordered east towards Chattanooga, withinstructions to repair the Memphis and Charleston railroad as headvanced.  Troops had been sent north by Halleck along the line of theMobile and Ohio railroad to put it in repair as far as Columbus.  Othertroops were stationed on the railroad from Jackson, Tennessee, to GrandJunction, and still others on the road west to Memphis.The remainder of the magnificent army of 120,000 men which enteredCorinth on the 30th of May had now become so scattered that I was putentirely on the defensive in a territory whose population was hostile tothe Union.  One of the first things I had to do was to constructfortifications at Corinth better suited to the garrison that could bespared to man them.  The structures that had been built during themonths of May and June were left as monuments to the skill of theengineer, and others were constructed in a few days, plainer in designbut suited to the command available to defend them.I disposed the troops belonging to the district in conformity with thesituation as rapidly as possible.  The forces at Donelson, Clarksvilleand Nashville, with those at Corinth and along the railroad eastward, Iregarded as sufficient for protection against any attack from the west.The Mobile and Ohio railroad was guarded from Rienzi, south of Corinth,to Columbus; and the Mississippi Central railroad from Jackson,Tennessee, to Bolivar.  Grand Junction and La Grange on the Memphisrailroad were abandoned.South of the Army of the Tennessee, and confronting it, was Van Dorn,with a sufficient force to organize a movable army of thirty-five toforty thousand men, after being reinforced by Price from Missouri.  Thismovable force could be thrown against either Corinth, Bolivar orMemphis; and the best that could be done in such event would be toweaken the points not threatened in order to reinforce the one that was.Nothing could be gained on the National side by attacking elsewhere,because the territory already occupied was as much as the force presentcould guard.  The most anxious period of the war, to me, was during thetime the Army of the Tennessee was guarding the territory acquired bythe fall of Corinth and Memphis and before I was sufficiently reinforcedto take the offensive.  The enemy also had cavalry operating in ourrear, making it necessary to guard every point of the railroad back toColumbus, on the security of which we were dependent for all oursupplies. Headquarters were connected by telegraph with all points ofthe command except Memphis and the Mississippi below Columbus.  Withthese points communication was had by the railroad to Columbus, thendown the river by boat.  To reinforce Memphis would take three or fourdays, and to get an order there for troops to move elsewhere would havetaken at least two days.  Memphis therefore was practically isolatedfrom the balance of the command.  But it was in Sherman's hands.  Thentoo the troops were well intrenched and the gunboats made a valuableauxiliary.During the two months after the departure of General Halleck there wasmuch fighting between small bodies of the contending armies, but theseencounters were dwarfed by the magnitude of the main battles so as to benow almost forgotten except by those engaged in them.  Some of them,however, estimated by the losses on both sides in killed and wounded,were equal in hard fighting to most of the battles of the Mexican warwhich attracted so much of the attention of the public when theyoccurred.  About the 23d of July Colonel Ross, commanding at Bolivar,was threatened by a large force of the enemy so that he had to bereinforced from Jackson and Corinth.  On the 27th there was skirmishingon the Hatchie River, eight miles from Bolivar. On the 30th I learnedfrom Colonel P. H. Sheridan, who had been far to the south, that Braggin person was at Rome, Georgia, with his troops moving by rail (by wayof Mobile) to Chattanooga and his wagon train marching overland to joinhim at Rome.  Price was at this time at Holly Springs, Mississippi, witha large force, and occupied Grand Junction as an outpost.  I proposed tothe general-in-chief to be permitted to drive him away, but was informedthat, while I had to judge for myself, the best use to make of my troopsWAS NOT TO SCATTER THEM, but hold them ready to reinforce Buell.The movement of Bragg himself with his wagon trains to Chattanoogaacross country, while his troops were transported over a longround-about road to the same destination, without need of guards exceptwhen in my immediate front, demonstrates the advantage which troopsenjoy while acting in a country where the people are friendly.  Buellwas marching through a hostile region and had to have his communicationsthoroughly guarded back to a base of supplies.  More men were requiredthe farther the National troops penetrated into the enemy's country.  I,with an army sufficiently powerful to have destroyed Bragg, was purelyon the defensive and accomplishing no more than to hold a force farinferior to my own.On the 2d of August I was ordered from Washington to live upon thecountry, on the resources of citizens hostile to the government, so faras practicable.  I was also directed to 'handle rebels within our lineswithout gloves,' to imprison them, or to expel them from their homes andfrom our lines.  I do not recollect having arrested and confined acitizen (not a soldier) during the entire rebellion.  I am aware that agreat many were sent to northern prisons, particularly to Joliet,Illinois, by some of my subordinates with the statement that it was myorder.  I had all such released the moment I learned of their arrest;and finally sent a staff officer north to release every prisoner who wassaid to be confined by my order.  There were many citizens at home whodeserved punishment because they were soldiers when an opportunity wasafforded to inflict an injury to the National cause.  This class was notof the kind that were apt to get arrested, and I deemed it better that afew guilty men should escape than that a great many innocent ones shouldsuffer.On the 14th of August I was ordered to send two more divisions to Buell.They were sent the same day by way of Decatur.  On the 22d ColonelRodney Mason surrendered Clarksville with six companies of his regiment.Colonel Mason was one of the officers who had led their regiments offthe field at almost the first fire of the rebels at Shiloh.  He was bynature and education a gentleman, and was terribly mortified at hisaction when the battle was over.  He came to me with tears in his eyesand begged to be allowed to have another trial.  I felt great sympathyfor him and sent him, with his regiment, to garrison Clarksville andDonelson.  He selected Clarksville for his headquarters, no doubtbecause he regarded it as the post of danger, it being nearer the enemy.But when he was summoned to surrender by a band of guerillas, hisconstitutional weakness overcame him.  He inquired the number of men theenemy had, and receiving a response indicating a force greater than hisown he said if he could be satisfied of that fact he would surrender.Arrangements were made for him to count the guerillas, and havingsatisfied himself that the enemy had the greater force he surrenderedand informed his subordinate at Donelson of the fact, advising him to dothe same.  The guerillas paroled their prisoners and moved uponDonelson, but the officer in command at that point marched out to meetthem and drove them away.Among other embarrassments, at the time of which I now write, was thefact that the government wanted to get out all the cotton possible fromthe South and directed me to give every facility toward that end.  Payin gold was authorized, and stations on the Mississippi River and on therailroad in our possession had to be designated where cotton would bereceived.  This opened to the enemy not only the means of convertingcotton into money, which had a value all over the world and which theyso much needed, but it afforded them means of obtaining accurate andintelligent information in regard to our position and strength.  It wasalso demoralizing to the troops.  Citizens obtaining permits from thetreasury department had to be protected within our lines and givenfacilities to get out cotton by which they realized enormous profits.Men who had enlisted to fight the battles of their country did not liketo be engaged in protecting a traffic which went to the support of anenemy they had to fight, and the profits of which went to men who sharednone of their dangers.On the 30th of August Colonel M. D. Leggett, near Bolivar, with the 20thand 29th Ohio volunteer infantry, was attacked by a force supposed to beabout 4,000 strong.  The enemy was driven away with a loss of more thanone hundred men.  On the 1st of September the bridge guard at Medon wasattacked by guerillas. The guard held the position until reinforced,when the enemy were routed leaving about fifty of their number on thefield dead or wounded, our loss being only two killed and fifteenwounded.  On the same day Colonel Dennis, with a force of less than 500infantry and two pieces of artillery, met the cavalry of the enemy instrong force, a few miles west of Medon, and drove them away with greatloss.  Our troops buried 179 of the enemy's dead, left upon the field.Afterwards it was found that all the houses in the vicinity of thebattlefield were turned into hospitals for the wounded.  Our loss, asreported at the time, was forty-five killed and wounded.  On the 2d ofSeptember I was ordered to send more reinforcements to Buell.  Jacksonand Bolivar were yet threatened, but I sent the reinforcements.  On the4th I received direct orders to send Granger's division also toLouisville, Kentucky.General Buell had left Corinth about the 10th of June to march uponChattanooga; Bragg, who had superseded Beauregard in command, sent onedivision from Tupelo on the 27th of June for the same place.  This gaveBuell about seventeen days' start. If he had not been required to repairthe railroad as he advanced, the march could have been made in eighteendays at the outside, and Chattanooga must have been reached by theNational forces before the rebels could have possibly got there.  Theroad between Nashville and Chattanooga could easily have been put inrepair by other troops, so that communication with the North would havebeen opened in a short time after the occupation of the place by theNational troops.  If Buell had been permitted to move in the firstinstance, with the whole of the Army of the Ohio and that portion of theArmy of the Mississippi afterwards sent to him, he could have thrownfour divisions from his own command along the line of road to repair andguard it.Granger's division was promptly sent on the 4th of September.  I was atthe station at Corinth when the troops reached that point, and foundGeneral P. H. Sheridan with them.  I expressed surprise at seeing himand said that I had not expected him to go.  He showed decideddisappointment at the prospect of being detained.  I felt a littlenettled at his desire to get away and did not detain him.Sheridan was a first lieutenant in the regiment in which I had servedeleven years, the 4th infantry, and stationed on the Pacific coast whenthe war broke out.  He was promoted to a captaincy in May, 1861, andbefore the close of the year managed in some way, I do not know how, toget East.  He went to Missouri.  Halleck had known him as a verysuccessful young officer in managing campaigns against the Indians onthe Pacific coast, and appointed him acting-quartermaster in south-westMissouri.  There was no difficulty in getting supplies forward whileSheridan served in that capacity; but he got into difficulty with hisimmediate superiors because of his stringent rules for preventing theuse of public transportation for private purposes.  He asked to berelieved from further duty in the capacity in which he was engaged andhis request was granted. When General Halleck took the field in April,1862, Sheridan was assigned to duty on his staff.  During the advance onCorinth a vacancy occurred in the colonelcy of the 2d Michigan cavalry.Governor Blair, of Michigan, telegraphed General Halleck asking him tosuggest the name of a professional soldier for the vacancy, saying hewould appoint a good man without reference to his State.  Sheridan wasnamed; and was so conspicuously efficient that when Corinth was reachedhe was assigned to command a cavalry brigade in the Army of theMississippi.  He was in command at Booneville on the 1st of July withtwo small regiments, when he was attacked by a force full three timesas numerous as his own.  By very skilful manoeuvres and boldness ofattack he completely routed the enemy.  For this he was made abrigadier-general and became a conspicuous figure in the army aboutCorinth.  On this account I was sorry to see him leaving me.  Hisdeparture was probably fortunate, for he rendered distinguished servicesin his new field.Granger and Sheridan reached Louisville before Buell got there, and onthe night of their arrival Sheridan with his command threw up worksaround the railroad station for the defence of troops as they came fromthe front.
ISFP	 XXVIII.ADVANCE OF VAN DORN AND PRICE--PRICE ENTERS IUKA--BATTLE OF IUKA.At this time, September 4th, I had two divisions of the Army of theMississippi stationed at Corinth, Rienzi, Jacinto and Danville.  Therewere at Corinth also Davies' division and two brigades of McArthur's,besides cavalry and artillery.  This force constituted my left wing, ofwhich Rosecrans was in command.  General Ord commanded the centre, fromBethel to Humboldt on the Mobile and Ohio railroad and from Jackson toBolivar where the Mississippi Central is crossed by the Hatchie River.General Sherman commanded on the right at Memphis with two of hisbrigades back at Brownsville, at the crossing of the Hatchie River bythe Memphis and Ohio railroad.  This made the most convenientarrangement I could devise for concentrating all my spare forces uponany threatened point.  All the troops of the command were withintelegraphic communication of each other, except those under Sherman.  Bybringing a portion of his command to Brownsville, from which point therewas a railroad and telegraph back to Memphis, communication could be hadwith that part of my command within a few hours by the use of couriers.In case it became necessary to reinforce Corinth, by this arrangementall the troops at Bolivar, except a small guard, could be sent by railby the way of Jackson in less than twenty-four hours; while the troopsfrom Brownsville could march up to Bolivar to take their place.On the 7th of September I learned of the advance of Van Dorn and Price,apparently upon Corinth.  One division was brought from Memphis toBolivar to meet any emergency that might arise from this move of theenemy.  I was much concerned because my first duty, after holding theterritory acquired within my command, was to prevent further reinforcingof Bragg in Middle Tennessee.  Already the Army of Northern Virginia haddefeated the army under General Pope and was invading Maryland.  In theCentre General Buell was on his way to Louisville and Bragg marchingparallel to him with a large Confederate force for the Ohio River.I had been constantly called upon to reinforce Buell until at this timemy entire force numbered less than 50,000 men, of all arms.  Thisincluded everything from Cairo south within my jurisdiction.  If I tooshould be driven back, the Ohio River would become the line dividing thebelligerents west of the Alleghanies, while at the East the line wasalready farther north than when hostilities commenced at the opening ofthe war.  It is true Nashville was never given up after its firstcapture, but it would have been isolated and the garrison there wouldhave been obliged to beat a hasty retreat if the troops in WestTennessee had been compelled to fall back.  To say at the end of thesecond year of the war the line dividing the contestants at the East waspushed north of Maryland, a State that had not seceded, and at the Westbeyond Kentucky, another State which had been always loyal, would havebeen discouraging indeed.  As it was, many loyal people despaired in thefall of 1862 of ever saving the Union.  The administration at Washingtonwas much concerned for the safety of the cause it held so dear. But Ibelieve there was never a day when the President did not think that, insome way or other, a cause so just as ours would come out triumphant.Up to the 11th of September Rosecrans still had troops on the railroadeast of Corinth, but they had all been ordered in.  By the 12th all werein except a small force under Colonel Murphy of the 8th Wisconsin.  Hehad been detained to guard the remainder of the stores which had not yetbeen brought in to Corinth.On the 13th of September General Sterling Price entered Iuka, a townabout twenty miles east of Corinth on the Memphis and Charlestonrailroad.  Colonel Murphy with a few men was guarding the place.  Hemade no resistance, but evacuated the town on the approach of the enemy.I was apprehensive lest the object of the rebels might be to get troopsinto Tennessee to reinforce Bragg, as it was afterwards ascertained tobe.  The authorities at Washington, including the general-in-chief ofthe army, were very anxious, as I have said, about affairs both in Eastand Middle Tennessee; and my anxiety was quite as great on their accountas for any danger threatening my command.  I had not force enough atCorinth to attack Price even by stripping everything; and there wasdanger that before troops could be got from other points he might be faron his way across the Tennessee.  To prevent this all spare forces atBolivar and Jackson were ordered to Corinth, and cars were concentratedat Jackson for their transportation.  Within twenty-four hours from thetransmission of the order the troops were at their destination, althoughthere had been a delay of four hours resulting from the forward traingetting off the track and stopping all the others.  This gave areinforcement of near 8,000 men, General Ord in command.  GeneralRosecrans commanded the district of Corinth with a movable force ofabout 9,000 independent of the garrison deemed necessary to be leftbehind.  It was known that General Van Dorn was about a four days' marchsouth of us, with a large force.  It might have been part of his plan toattack at Corinth, Price coming from the east while he came up from thesouth.  My desire was to attack Price before Van Dorn could reachCorinth or go to his relief.General Rosecrans had previously had his headquarters at Iuka, where hiscommand was spread out along the Memphis and Charleston railroadeastward.  While there he had a most excellent map prepared showing allthe roads and streams in the surrounding country.  He was alsopersonally familiar with the ground, so that I deferred very much to himin my plans for the approach.  We had cars enough to transport all ofGeneral Ord's command, which was to go by rail to Burnsville, a point onthe road about seven miles west of Iuka.  From there his troops were tomarch by the north side of the railroad and attack Price from thenorth-west, while Rosecrans was to move eastward from his position southof Corinth by way of the Jacinto road.  A small force was to hold theJacinto road where it turns to the north-east, while the main forcemoved on the Fulton road which comes into Iuka further east.  This planwas suggested by Rosecrans.Bear Creek, a few miles to the east of the Fulton road, is a formidableobstacle to the movement of troops in the absence of bridges, all ofwhich, in September, 1862, had been destroyed in that vicinity.  TheTennessee, to the north-east, not many miles away, was also a formidableobstacle for an army followed by a pursuing force.  Ord was on thenorth-west, and even if a rebel movement had been possible in thatdirection it could have brought only temporary relief, for it would havecarried Price's army to the rear of the National forces and isolated itfrom all support.  It looked to me that, if Price would remain in Iukauntil we could get there, his annihilation was inevitable.On the morning of the 18th of September General Ord moved by rail toBurnsville, and there left the cars and moved out to perform his part ofthe programme.  He was to get as near the enemy as possible during theday and intrench himself so as to hold his position until the nextmorning.  Rosecrans was to be up by the morning of the 19th on the tworoads before described, and the attack was to be from all three quarterssimultaneously.  Troops enough were left at Jacinto and Rienzi to detainany cavalry that Van Dorn might send out to make a sudden dash intoCorinth until I could be notified.  There was a telegraph wire along therailroad, so there would be no delay in communication.  I detained carsand locomotives enough at Burnsville to transport the whole of Ord'scommand at once, and if Van Dorn had moved against Corinth instead ofIuka I could have thrown in reinforcements to the number of 7,000 or8,000 before he could have arrived.  I remained at Burnsville with adetachment of about 900 men from Ord's command and communicated with mytwo wings by courier.  Ord met the advance of the enemy soon afterleaving Burnsville.  Quite a sharp engagement ensued, but he drove therebels back with considerable loss, including one general officerkilled.  He maintained his position and was ready to attack by daylightthe next morning.  I was very much disappointed at receiving a dispatchfrom Rosecrans after midnight from Jacinto, twenty-two miles from Iuka,saying that some of his command had been delayed, and that the rear ofhis column was not yet up as far as Jacinto.  He said, however, that hewould still be at Iuka by two o'clock the next day.  I did not believethis possible because of the distance and the condition of the roads,which was bad; besides, troops after a forced march of twenty miles arenot in a good condition for fighting the moment they get through.  Itmight do in marching to relieve a beleaguered garrison, but not to makean assault.  I immediately sent Ord a copy of Rosecrans' dispatch andordered him to be in readiness to attack the moment he heard the soundof guns to the south or south-east.  He was instructed to notify hisofficers to be on the alert for any indications of battle. During the19th the wind blew in the wrong direction to transmit sound eithertowards the point where Ord was, or to Burnsville where I had remained.A couple of hours before dark on the 19th Rosecrans arrived with thehead of his column at garnets, the point where the Jacinto road to Iukaleaves the road going east.  He here turned north without sending anytroops to the Fulton road.  While still moving in column up the Jacintoroad he met a force of the enemy and had his advance badly beaten anddriven back upon the main road.  In this short engagement his loss wasconsiderable for the number engaged, and one battery was taken from him.The wind was still blowing hard and in the wrong direction to transmitsounds towards either Ord or me.  Neither he nor I nor any one in eithercommand heard a gun that was fired upon the battle-field.  After theengagement Rosecrans sent me a dispatch announcing the result.  This wasbrought by a courier.  There was no road between Burnsville and theposition then occupied by Rosecrans and the country was impassable for aman on horseback.  The courier bearing the message was compelled to movewest nearly to Jacinto before he found a road leading to Burnsville.This made it a late hour of the night before I learned of the battlethat had taken place during the afternoon.  I at once notified Ord ofthe fact and ordered him to attack early in the morning.  The nextmorning Rosecrans himself renewed the attack and went into Iuka with butlittle resistance.  Ord also went in according to orders, withouthearing a gun from the south of town but supposing the troops comingfrom the south-west must be up by that time.  Rosecrans, however, hadput no troops upon the Fulton road, and the enemy had taken advantage ofthis neglect and retreated by that road during the night.  Word was soonbrought to me that our troops were in Iuka.  I immediately rode intotown and found that the enemy was not being pursued even by the cavalry.I ordered pursuit by the whole of Rosecrans' command and went on withhim a few miles in person.  He followed only a few miles after I lefthim and then went into camp, and the pursuit was continued no further.I was disappointed at the result of the battle of Iuka--but I had sohigh an opinion of General Rosecrans that I found no fault at the time.
ISFP	 XXIX.VAN DORN'S MOVEMENTS--BATTLE OF CORINTH--COMMAND OF THE DEPARTMENT OFTHE TENNESSEE.On the 19th of September General Geo. H. Thomas was ordered east toreinforce Buell.  This threw the army at my command still more on thedefensive.  The Memphis and Charleston railroad was abandoned, except atCorinth, and small forces were left at Chewalla and Grand Junction.Soon afterwards the latter of these two places was given up and Bolivarbecame our most advanced position on the Mississippi Central railroad.Our cavalry was kept well to the front and frequent expeditions weresent out to watch the movements of the enemy.  We were in a countrywhere nearly all the people, except the negroes, were hostile to us andfriendly to the cause we were trying to suppress.  It was easy,therefore, for the enemy to get early information of our every move.We, on the contrary, had to go after our information in force, and thenoften returned without it.On the 22d Bolivar was threatened by a large force from south of GrandJunction, supposed to be twenty regiments of infantry with cavalry andartillery.  I reinforced Bolivar, and went to Jackson in person tosuperintend the movement of troops to whatever point the attack might bemade upon.  The troops from Corinth were brought up in time to repel thethreatened movement without a battle.  Our cavalry followed the enemysouth of Davis' mills in Mississippi.On the 30th I found that Van Dorn was apparently endeavoring to strikethe Mississippi River above Memphis.  At the same time other pointswithin my command were so threatened that it was impossible toconcentrate a force to drive him away.  There was at this juncture alarge Union force at Helena, Arkansas, which, had it been within mycommand, I could have ordered across the river to attack and break upthe Mississippi Central railroad far to the south.  This would not onlyhave called Van Dorn back, but would have compelled the retention of alarge rebel force far to the south to prevent a repetition of such raidson the enemy's line of supplies.  Geographical lines between thecommands during the rebellion were not always well chosen, or they weretoo rigidly adhered to.Van Dorn did not attempt to get upon the line above Memphis, as hadapparently been his intention.  He was simply covering a deeper design;one much more important to his cause.  By the 1st of October it wasfully apparent that Corinth was to be attacked with great force anddetermination, and that Van Dorn, Lovell, Price, Villepigue and Rust hadjoined their strength for this purpose.  There was some skirmishingoutside of Corinth with the advance of the enemy on the 3d.  The rebelsmassed in the north-west angle of the Memphis and Charleston and theMobile and Ohio railroads, and were thus between the troops at Corinthand all possible reinforcements.  Any fresh troops for us must come by acircuitous route.On the night of the 3d, accordingly, I ordered General McPherson, whowas at Jackson, to join Rosecrans at Corinth with reinforcements pickedup along the line of the railroad equal to a brigade.  Hurlbut had beenordered from Bolivar to march for the same destination; and as Van Dornwas coming upon Corinth from the north-west some of his men fell in withthe advance of Hurlbut's and some skirmishing ensued on the evening ofthe 3d.  On the 4th Van Dorn made a dashing attack, hoping, no doubt, tocapture Rosecrans before his reinforcements could come up.  In that casethe enemy himself could have occupied the defences of Corinth and heldat bay all the Union troops that arrived.  In fact he could have takenthe offensive against the reinforcements with three or four times theirnumber and still left a sufficient garrison in the works about Corinthto hold them.  He came near success, some of his troops penetrating theNational lines at least once, but the works that were built afterHalleck's departure enabled Rosecrans to hold his position until thetroops of both McPherson and Hurlbut approached towards the rebel frontand rear.  The enemy was finally driven back with great slaughter:  alltheir charges, made with great gallantry, were repulsed.  The loss onour side was heavy, but nothing to compare with Van Dorn's.  McPhersoncame up with the train of cars bearing his command as close to the enemyas was prudent, debarked on the rebel flank and got in to the support ofRosecrans just after the repulse.  His approach, as well as that ofHurlbut, was known to the enemy and had a moral effect. GeneralRosecrans, however, failed to follow up the victory, although I hadgiven specific orders in advance of the battle for him to pursue themoment the enemy was repelled.  He did not do so, and I repeated theorder after the battle.  In the first order he was notified that theforce of 4,000 men which was going to his assistance would be in greatperil if the enemy was not pursued.General Ord had joined Hurlbut on the 4th and being senior took commandof his troops.  This force encountered the head of Van Dorn's retreatingcolumn just as it was crossing the Hatchie by a bridge some ten milesout from Corinth.  The bottom land here was swampy and bad for theoperations of troops, making a good place to get an enemy into.  Ordattacked the troops that had crossed the bridge and drove them back in apanic.  Many were killed, and others were drowned by being pushed offthe bridge in their hurried retreat.  Ord followed and met the mainforce.  He was too weak in numbers to assault, but he held the bridgeand compelled the enemy to resume his retreat by another bridge higherup the stream.  Ord was wounded in this engagement and the commanddevolved on Hurlbut.Rosecrans did not start in pursuit till the morning of the 5th and thentook the wrong road.  Moving in the enemy's country he travelled with awagon train to carry his provisions and munitions of war.  His march wastherefore slower than that of the enemy, who was moving towards hissupplies.  Two or three hours of pursuit on the day of battle, withoutanything except what the men carried on their persons, would have beenworth more than any pursuit commenced the next day could have possiblybeen.  Even when he did start, if Rosecrans had followed the route takenby the enemy, he would have come upon Van Dorn in a swamp with a streamin front and Ord holding the only bridge; but he took the road leadingnorth and towards Chewalla instead of west, and, after having marched asfar as the enemy had moved to get to the Hatchie, he was as far frombattle as when he started.  Hurlbut had not the numbers to meet any suchforce as Van Dorn's if they had been in any mood for fighting, and hemight have been in great peril.I now regarded the time to accomplish anything by pursuit as past and,after Rosecrans reached Jonesboro, I ordered him to return.  He kept onto Ripley, however, and was persistent in wanting to go farther.  Ithereupon ordered him to halt and submitted the matter to thegeneral-in-chief, who allowed me to exercise my judgment in the matter,but inquired 'why not pursue?'  Upon this I ordered Rosecrans back.  Hadhe gone much farther he would have met a greater force than Van Dorn hadat Corinth and behind intrenchments or on chosen ground, and theprobabilities are he would have lost his army.The battle of Corinth was bloody, our loss being 315 killed, 1,812wounded and 232 missing.  The enemy lost many more. Rosecrans reported1,423 dead and 2,225 prisoners.  We fought behind breastworks, whichaccounts in some degree for the disparity.  Among the killed on our sidewas General Hackelman.  General Oglesby was badly, it was for some timesupposed mortally, wounded.  I received a congratulatory letter from thePresident, which expressed also his sorrow for the losses.This battle was recognized by me as being a decided victory, though notso complete as I had hoped for, nor nearly so complete as I now thinkwas within the easy grasp of the commanding officer at Corinth.  Sincethe war it is known that the result, as it was, was a crushing blow tothe enemy, and felt by him much more than it was appreciated at theNorth.  The battle relieved me from any further anxiety for the safetyof the territory within my jurisdiction, and soon after receivingreinforcements I suggested to the general-in-chief a forward movementagainst Vicksburg.On the 23d of October I learned of Pemberton's being in command at HollySprings and much reinforced by conscripts and troops from Alabama andTexas.  The same day General Rosecrans was relieved from duty with mycommand, and shortly after he succeeded Buell in the command of the armyin Middle Tennessee.  I was delighted at the promotion of GeneralRosecrans to a separate command, because I still believed that whenindependent of an immediate superior the qualities which I, at thattime, credited him with possessing, would show themselves.  As asubordinate I found that I could not make him do as I wished, and haddetermined to relieve him from duty that very day.At the close of the operations just described my force, in roundnumbers, was 48,500.  Of these 4,800 were in Kentucky and Illinois,7,000 in Memphis, 19,200 from Mound City south, and 17,500 at Corinth.General McClernand had been authorized from Washington to go north andorganize troops to be used in opening the Mississippi.  These new levieswith other reinforcements now began to come in.On the 25th of October I was placed in command of the Department of theTennessee.  Reinforcements continued to come from the north and by the2d of November I was prepared to take the initiative.  This was a greatrelief after the two and a half months of continued defence over a largedistrict of country, and where nearly every citizen was an enemy readyto give information of our every move.  I have described veryimperfectly a few of the battles and skirmishes that took place duringthis time.  To describe all would take more space than I can allot tothe purpose; to make special mention of all the officers and troops whodistinguished themselves, would take a volume. (*9)
ISFP	 XXX.THE CAMPAIGN AGAINST VICKSBURG--EMPLOYING THE FREEDMEN--OCCUPATION OFHOLLY SPRINGS--SHERMAN ORDERED TO MEMPHIS--SHERMAN'S MOVEMENTS DOWN THEMISSISSIPPI--VAN DORN CAPTURES HOLLY SPRINGS--COLLECTING FORAGE ANDFOOD.Vicksburg was important to the enemy because it occupied the first highground coming close to the river below Memphis.  From there a railroadruns east, connecting with other roads leading to all points of theSouthern States.  A railroad also starts from the opposite side of theriver, extending west as far as Shreveport, Louisiana.  Vicksburg wasthe only channel, at the time of the events of which this chaptertreats, connecting the parts of the Confederacy divided by theMississippi.  So long as it was held by the enemy, the free navigationof the river was prevented.  Hence its importance.  Points on the riverbetween Vicksburg and Port Hudson were held as dependencies; but theirfall was sure to follow the capture of the former place.The campaign against Vicksburg commenced on the 2d of November asindicated in a dispatch to the general-in-chief in the following words:'I have commenced a movement on Grand Junction, with three divisionsfrom Corinth and two from Bolivar.  Will leave here [Jackson, Tennessee]to-morrow, and take command in person.  If found practicable, I will goto Holly Springs, and, may be, Grenada, completing railroad andtelegraph as I go.'At this time my command was holding the Mobile and Ohio railroad fromabout twenty-five miles south of Corinth, north to Columbus, Kentucky;the Mississippi Central from Bolivar north to its junction with theMobile and Ohio; the Memphis and Charleston from Corinth east to BearCreek, and the Mississippi River from Cairo to Memphis.  My entirecommand was no more than was necessary to hold these lines, and hardlythat if kept on the defensive.  By moving against the enemy and into hisunsubdued, or not yet captured, territory, driving their army before us,these lines would nearly hold themselves; thus affording a large forcefor field operations.  My moving force at that time was about 30,000men, and I estimated the enemy confronting me, under Pemberton, at aboutthe same number.  General McPherson commanded my left wing and GeneralC. S. Hamilton the centre, while Sherman was at Memphis with the rightwing.  Pemberton was fortified at the Tallahatchie, but occupied HollySprings and Grand Junction on the Mississippi Central railroad.  On the8th we occupied Grand Junction and La Grange, throwing a considerableforce seven or eight miles south, along the line of the railroad.  Theroad from Bolivar forward was repaired and put in running order as thetroops advanced.Up to this time it had been regarded as an axiom in war that largebodies of troops must operate from a base of supplies which they alwayscovered and guarded in all forward movements.  There was delay thereforein repairing the road back, and in gathering and forwarding supplies tothe front.By my orders, and in accordance with previous instructions fromWashington, all the forage within reach was collected under thesupervision of the chief quartermaster and the provisions under thechief commissary, receipts being given when there was any one to takethem; the supplies in any event to be accounted for as governmentstores.  The stock was bountiful, but still it gave me no idea of thepossibility of supplying a moving column in an enemy's country from thecountry itself.It was at this point, probably, where the first idea of a 'Freedman'sBureau' took its origin.  Orders of the government prohibited theexpulsion of the negroes from the protection of the army, when they camein voluntarily.  Humanity forbade allowing them to starve.  With such anarmy of them, of all ages and both sexes, as had congregated about GrandJunction, amounting to many thousands, it was impossible to advance.There was no special authority for feeding them unless they wereemployed as teamsters, cooks and pioneers with the army; but onlyable-bodied young men were suitable for such work.  This labor wouldsupport but a very limited percentage of them.  The plantations were alldeserted; the cotton and corn were ripe: men, women and children aboveten years of age could be employed in saving these crops.  To do thiswork with contrabands, or to have it done, organization under acompetent chief was necessary.  On inquiring for such a man ChaplainEaton, now and for many years the very able United States Commissionerof Education, was suggested.  He proved as efficient in that field as hehas since done in his present one.  I gave him all the assistants andguards he called for.  We together fixed the prices to be paid for thenegro labor, whether rendered to the government or to individuals.  Thecotton was to be picked from abandoned plantations, the laborers toreceive the stipulated price (my recollection is twelve and a half centsper pound for picking and ginning) from the quartermaster, he shippingthe cotton north to be sold for the benefit of the government. Citizensremaining on their plantations were allowed the privilege of havingtheir crops saved by freedmen on the same terms.At once the freedmen became self-sustaining.  The money was not paid tothem directly, but was expended judiciously and for their benefit.  Theygave me no trouble afterwards.Later the freedmen were engaged in cutting wood along the MississippiRiver to supply the large number of steamers on that stream.  A goodprice was paid for chopping wood used for the supply of governmentsteamers (steamers chartered and which the government had to supply withfuel).  Those supplying their own fuel paid a much higher price.  Inthis way a fund was created not only sufficient to feed and clothe all,old and young, male and female, but to build them comfortable cabins,hospitals for the sick, and to supply them with many comforts they hadnever known before.At this stage of the campaign against Vicksburg I was very muchdisturbed by newspaper rumors that General McClernand was to have aseparate and independent command within mine, to operate againstVicksburg by way of the Mississippi River.  Two commanders on the samefield are always one too many, and in this case I did not think thegeneral selected had either the experience or the qualifications to fithim for so important a position.  I feared for the safety of the troopsintrusted to him, especially as he was to raise new levies, raw troops,to execute so important a trust.  But on the 12th I received a dispatchfrom General Halleck saying that I had command of all the troops sent tomy department and authorizing me to fight the enemy where I pleased.The next day my cavalry was in Holly Springs, and the enemy fell backsouth of the Tallahatchie.Holly Springs I selected for my depot of supplies and munitions of war,all of which at that time came by rail from Columbus, Kentucky, exceptthe few stores collected about La Grange and Grand Junction.  This was along line (increasing in length as we moved south) to maintain in anenemy's country.  On the 15th of November, while I was still at HollySprings, I sent word to Sherman to meet me at Columbus.  We were butforty-seven miles apart, yet the most expeditious way for us to meet wasfor me to take the rail to Columbus and Sherman a steamer for the sameplace.  At that meeting, besides talking over my general plans I gavehim his orders to join me with two divisions and to march them down theMississippi Central railroad if he could. Sherman, who was alwaysprompt, was up by the 29th to Cottage Hill, ten miles north of Oxford.He brought three divisions with him, leaving a garrison of only fourregiments of infantry, a couple of pieces of artillery and a smalldetachment of cavalry. Further reinforcements he knew were on their wayfrom the north to Memphis.  About this time General Halleck orderedtroops from Helena, Arkansas (territory west of the Mississippi was notunder my command then) to cut the road in Pemberton's rear.  Theexpedition was under Generals Hovey and C. C. Washburn and wassuccessful so far as reaching the railroad was concerned, but the damagedone was very slight and was soon repaired.The Tallahatchie, which confronted me, was very high, the railroadbridge destroyed and Pemberton strongly fortified on the south side.  Acrossing would have been impossible in the presence of an enemy.  I sentthe cavalry higher up the stream and they secured a crossing.  Thiscaused the enemy to evacuate their position, which was possiblyaccelerated by the expedition of Hovey and Washburn.  The enemy wasfollowed as far south as Oxford by the main body of troops, and someseventeen miles farther by McPherson's command.  Here the pursuit washalted to repair the railroad from the Tallahatchie northward, in orderto bring up supplies.  The piles on which the railroad bridge rested hadbeen left standing.  The work of constructing a roadway for the troopswas but a short matter, and, later, rails were laid for cars.During the delay at Oxford in repairing railroads I learned that anexpedition down the Mississippi now was inevitable and, desiring to havea competent commander in charge, I ordered Sherman on the 8th ofDecember back to Memphis to take charge. The following were his orders:Headquarters 13th Army Corps, Department of the Tennessee. OXFORD,MISSISSIPPI, December 8,1862.MAJOR-GENERAL W. T. SHERMAN, Commanding Right Wing:You will proceed, with as little delay as possible, to Memphis,Tennessee, taking with you one division of your present command.  Onyour arrival at Memphis you will assume command of all the troops there,and that portion of General Curtis's forces at present east of theMississippi River, and organize them into brigades and divisions in yourown army.  As soon as possible move with them down the river to thevicinity of Vicksburg, and with the co-operation of the gunboat fleetunder command of Flag-officer Porter proceed to the reduction of thatplace in such a manner as circumstances, and your own judgment, maydictate.The amount of rations, forage, land transportation, etc., necessary totake, will be left entirely with yourself.  The Quartermaster at St.Louis will be instructed to send you transportation for 30,000 men;should you still find yourself deficient, your quartermaster will beauthorized to make up the deficiency from such transports as may comeinto the port of Memphis.On arriving in Memphis, put yourself in communication with AdmiralPorter, and arrange with him for his co-operation.Inform me at the earliest practicable day of the time when you willembark, and such plans as may then be matured.  I will hold the forceshere in readiness to co-operate with you in such manner as the movementsof the enemy may make necessary.Leave the District of Memphis in the command of an efficient officer,and with a garrison of four regiments of infantry, the siege guns, andwhatever cavalry may be there.U. S. GRANT, Major-General.This idea had presented itself to my mind earlier, for on the 3d ofDecember I asked Halleck if it would not be well to hold the enemy southof the Yallabusha and move a force from Helena and Memphis on Vicksburg.On the 5th again I suggested, from Oxford, to Halleck that if the Helenatroops were at my command I though it would be possible to take them andthe Memphis forces south of the mouth of the Yazoo River, and thussecure Vicksburg and the State of Mississippi.  Halleck on the same day,the 5th of December, directed me not to attempt to hold the countrysouth of the Tallahatchie, but to collect 25,000 troops at Memphis bythe 20th for the Vicksburg expedition.  I sent Sherman with twodivisions at once, informed the general-in-chief of the fact, and askedwhether I should command the expedition down the river myself or sendSherman.  I was authorized to do as I though best for the accomplishmentof the great object in view.  I sent Sherman and so informed GeneralHalleck.As stated, my action in sending Sherman back was expedited by a desireto get him in command of the forces separated from my directsupervision.  I feared that delay might bring McClernand, who was hissenior and who had authority from the President and Secretary of War toexercise that particular command,--and independently.  I doubtedMcClernand's fitness; and I had good reason to believe that inforestalling him I was by no means giving offence to those whoseauthority to command was above both him and me.Neither my orders to General Sherman, nor the correspondence between usor between General Halleck and myself, contemplated at the time my goingfurther south than the Yallabusha. Pemberton's force in my front was themain part of the garrison of Vicksburg, as the force with me was thedefence of the territory held by us in West Tennessee and Kentucky.  Ihoped to hold Pemberton in my front while Sherman should get in his rearand into Vicksburg.  The further north the enemy could be held thebetter.It was understood, however, between General Sherman and myself that ourmovements were to be co-operative; if Pemberton could not be held awayfrom Vicksburg I was to follow him; but at that time it was not expectedto abandon the railroad north of the Yallabusha.  With that point as asecondary base of supplies, the possibility of moving down the Yazoountil communications could be opened with the Mississippi wascontemplated.It was my intention, and so understood by Sherman and his command, thatif the enemy should fall back I would follow him even to the gates ofVicksburg.  I intended in such an event to hold the road to Grenada onthe Yallabusha and cut loose from there, expecting to establish a newbase of supplies on the Yazoo, or at Vicksburg itself, with Grenada tofall back upon in case of failure.  It should be remembered that at thetime I speak of it had not been demonstrated that an army could operatein an enemy's territory depending upon the country for supplies.  A haltwas called at Oxford with the advance seventeen miles south of there, tobring up the road to the latter point and to bring supplies of food,forage and munitions to the front.On the 18th of December I received orders from Washington to divide mycommand into four army corps, with General McClernand to command one ofthem and to be assigned to that part of the army which was to operatedown the Mississippi.  This interfered with my plans, but probablyresulted in my ultimately taking the command in person.  McClernand wasat that time in Springfield, Illinois.  The order was obeyed without anydelay.  Dispatches were sent to him the same day in conformity.On the 20th General Van Dorn appeared at Holly Springs, my secondarybase of supplies, captured the garrison of 1,500 men commanded byColonel Murphy, of the 8th Wisconsin regiment, and destroyed all ourmunitions of war, food and forage.  The capture was a disgraceful one tothe officer commanding but not to the troops under him.  At the sametime Forrest got on our line of railroad between Jackson, Tennessee, andColumbus, Kentucky, doing much damage to it.  This cut me off from allcommunication with the north for more than a week, and it was more thantwo weeks before rations or forage could be issued from stores obtainedin the regular way.  This demonstrated the impossibility of maintainingso long a line of road over which to draw supplies for an army moving inan enemy's country.  I determined, therefore, to abandon my campaigninto the interior with Columbus as a base, and returned to La Grange andGrand Junction destroying the road to my front and repairing the road toMemphis, making the Mississippi river the line over which to drawsupplies.  Pemberton was falling back at the same time.The moment I received the news of Van Dorn's success I sent the cavalryat the front back to drive him from the country.  He had start enough tomove north destroying the railroad in many places, and to attack severalsmall garrisons intrenched as guards to the railroad.  All these hefound warned of his coming and prepared to receive him.  Van Dorn didnot succeed in capturing a single garrison except the one at HollySprings, which was larger than all the others attacked by him puttogether.  Murphy was also warned of Van Dorn's approach, but made nopreparations to meet him.  He did not even notify his command.Colonel Murphy was the officer who, two months before, had evacuatedIuka on the approach of the enemy.  General Rosecrans denounced him forthe act and desired to have him tried and punished.  I sustained thecolonel at the time because his command was a small one compared withthat of the enemy--not one-tenth as large--and I thought he had donewell to get away without falling into their hands.  His leaving largestores to fall into Price's possession I looked upon as an oversight andexcused it on the ground of inexperience in military matters. He should,however, have destroyed them.  This last surrender demonstrated to mymind that Rosecrans' judgment of Murphy's conduct at Iuka was correct.The surrender of Holly Springs was most reprehensible and showed eitherthe disloyalty of Colonel Murphy to the cause which he professed toserve, or gross cowardice.After the war was over I read from the diary of a lady who accompaniedGeneral Pemberton in his retreat from the Tallahatchie, that the retreatwas almost a panic.  The roads were bad and it was difficult to move theartillery and trains.  Why there should have been a panic I do not see.No expedition had yet started down the Mississippi River.  Had I knownthe demoralized condition of the enemy, or the fact that centralMississippi abounded so in all army supplies, I would have been inpursuit of Pemberton while his cavalry was destroying the roads in myrear.After sending cavalry to drive Van Dorn away, my next order was todispatch all the wagons we had, under proper escort, to collect andbring in all supplies of forage and food from a region of fifteen mileseast and west of the road from our front back to Grand Junction, leavingtwo months' supplies for the families of those whose stores were taken.I was amazed at the quantity of supplies the country afforded.  Itshowed that we could have subsisted off the country for two monthsinstead of two weeks without going beyond the limits designated.  Thistaught me a lesson which was taken advantage of later in the campaignwhen our army lived twenty days with the issue of only five days'rations by the commissary.  Our loss of supplies was great at HollySprings, but it was more than compensated for by those taken from thecountry and by the lesson taught.The news of the capture of Holly Springs and the destruction of oursupplies caused much rejoicing among the people remaining in Oxford.They came with broad smiles on their faces, indicating intense joy, toask what I was going to do now without anything for my soldiers to eat.I told them that I was not disturbed; that I had already sent troops andwagons to collect all the food and forage they could find for fifteenmiles on each side of the road.  Countenances soon changed, and so didthe inquiry.  The next was, 'What are WE to do?'  My response was thatwe had endeavored to feed ourselves from our own northern resourceswhile visiting them; but their friends in gray had been uncivil enoughto destroy what we had brought along, and it could not be expected thatmen, with arms in their hands, would starve in the midst of plenty.  Iadvised them to emigrate east, or west, fifteen miles and assist ineating up what we left.
ISFP	 XXXI.HEADQUARTERS MOVED TO HOLLY SPRINGS--GENERAL M'CLERNAND IN COMMAND--ASSUMING COMMAND AT YOUNG'S POINT--OPERATIONS ABOVE VICKSBURG--FORTIFICATIONS ABOUT VICKSBURG--THE CANAL--LAKE PROVIDENCE--OPERATIONS AT YAZOO PASS.This interruption in my communications north--I was really cut off fromcommunication with a great part of my own command during this time--resulted in Sherman's moving from Memphis before McClernand couldarrive, for my dispatch of the 18th did not reach McClernand.  Pembertongot back to Vicksburg before Sherman got there.  The rebel positionswere on a bluff on the Yazoo River, some miles above its mouth.  Thewaters were high so that the bottoms were generally overflowed, leavingonly narrow causeways of dry land between points of debarkation and thehigh bluffs.  These were fortified and defended at all points.  Therebel position was impregnable against any force that could be broughtagainst its front.  Sherman could not use one-fourth of his force.  Hisefforts to capture the city, or the high ground north of it, werenecessarily unavailing.Sherman's attack was very unfortunate, but I had no opportunity ofcommunicating with him after the destruction of the road and telegraphto my rear on the 20th.  He did not know but what I was in the rear ofthe enemy and depending on him to open a new base of supplies for thetroops with me.  I had, before he started from Memphis, directed him totake with him a few small steamers suitable for the navigation of theYazoo, not knowing but that I might want them to supply me after cuttingloose from my base at Grenada.On the 23d I removed my headquarters back to Holly Springs.  The troopswere drawn back gradually, but without haste or confusion, findingsupplies abundant and no enemy following.  The road was not damagedsouth of Holly Springs by Van Dorn, at least not to an extent to causeany delay.  As I had resolved to move headquarters to Memphis, and torepair the road to that point, I remained at Holly Springs until thiswork was completed.On the 10th of January, the work on the road from Holly Springs to GrandJunction and thence to Memphis being completed, I moved my headquartersto the latter place.  During the campaign here described, the losses(mostly captures) were about equal, crediting the rebels with theirHolly Springs capture, which they could not hold.When Sherman started on his expedition down the river he had 20,000 men,taken from Memphis, and was reinforced by 12,000 more at Helena,Arkansas.  The troops on the west bank of the river had previously beenassigned to my command.  McClernand having received the orders for hisassignment reached the mouth of the Yazoo on the 2d of January, andimmediately assumed command of all the troops with Sherman, being a partof his own corps, the 13th, and all of Sherman's, the 15th.  Sherman,and Admiral Porter with the fleet, had withdrawn from the Yazoo. Afterconsultation they decided that neither the army nor navy could renderservice to the cause where they were, and learning that I had withdrawnfrom the interior of Mississippi, they determined to return to theArkansas River and to attack Arkansas Post, about fifty miles up thatstream and garrisoned by about five or six thousand men.  Sherman hadlearned of the existence of this force through a man who had beencaptured by the enemy with a steamer loaded with ammunition and othersupplies intended for his command.  The man had made his escape.McClernand approved this move reluctantly, as Sherman says.  No obstaclewas encountered until the gunboats and transports were within range ofthe fort.  After three days' bombardment by the navy an assault was madeby the troops and marines, resulting in the capture of the place, and intaking 5,000 prisoners and 17 guns.  I was at first disposed todisapprove of this move as an unnecessary side movement having noespecial bearing upon the work before us; but when the result wasunderstood I regarded it as very important.  Five thousand Confederatetroops left in the rear might have caused us much trouble and loss ofproperty while navigating the Mississippi.Immediately after the reduction of Arkansas Post and the capture of thegarrison, McClernand returned with his entire force to Napoleon, at themouth of the Arkansas River.  From here I received messages from bothSherman and Admiral Porter, urging me to come and take command inperson, and expressing their distrust of McClernand's ability andfitness for so important and intricate an expedition.On the 17th I visited McClernand and his command at Napoleon. It washere made evident to me that both the army and navy were so distrustfulof McClernand's fitness to command that, while they would do all theycould to insure success, this distrust was an element of weakness.  Itwould have been criminal to send troops under these circumstances intosuch danger.  By this time I had received authority to relieveMcClernand, or to assign any person else to the command of the riverexpedition, or to assume command in person.  I felt great embarrassmentabout McClernand.  He was the senior major-general after myself withinthe department.  It would not do, with his rank and ambition, to assigna junior over him.  Nothing was left, therefore, but to assume thecommand myself.  I would have been glad to put Sherman in command, togive him an opportunity to accomplish what he had failed in the Decemberbefore; but there seemed no other way out of the difficulty, for he wasjunior to McClernand.  Sherman's failure needs no apology.On the 20th I ordered General McClernand with the entire command, toYoung's Point and Milliken's Bend, while I returned to Memphis to makeall the necessary preparation for leaving the territory behind mesecure.  General Hurlbut with the 16th corps was left in command.  TheMemphis and Charleston railroad was held, while the Mississippi Centralwas given up.  Columbus was the only point between Cairo and Memphis, onthe river, left with a garrison.  All the troops and guns from the postson the abandoned railroad and river were sent to the front.On the 29th of January I arrived at Young's Point and assumed commandthe following day.  General McClernand took exception in a mostcharacteristic way--for him.  His correspondence with me on the subjectwas more in the nature of a reprimand than a protest. It was highlyinsubordinate, but I overlooked it, as I believed, for the good of theservice.  General McClernand was a politician of very considerableprominence in his State; he was a member of Congress when the secessionwar broke out; he belonged to that political party which furnished allthe opposition there was to a vigorous prosecution of the war for savingthe Union; there was no delay in his declaring himself for the Union atall hazards, and there was no uncertain sound in his declaration ofwhere he stood in the contest before the country.  He also gave up hisseat in Congress to take the field in defence of the principles he hadproclaimed.The real work of the campaign and siege of Vicksburg now began.  Theproblem was to secure a footing upon dry ground on the east side of theriver from which the troops could operate against Vicksburg.  TheMississippi River, from Cairo south, runs through a rich alluvial valleyof many miles in width, bound on the east by land running from eighty upto two or more hundred feet above the river.  On the west side thehighest land, except in a few places, is but little above the highestwater.  Through this valley the river meanders in the most tortuous way,varying in direction to all points of the compass.  At places it runs tothe very foot of the bluffs. After leaving Memphis, there are no suchhighlands coming to the water's edge on the east shore until Vicksburgis reached.The intervening land is cut up by bayous filled from the river in highwater--many of them navigable for steamers.  All of them would be,except for overhanging trees, narrowness and tortuous course, making itimpossible to turn the bends with vessels of any considerable length.Marching across this country in the face of an enemy was impossible;navigating it proved equally impracticable.  The strategical wayaccording to the rule, therefore, would have been to go back to Memphis;establish that as a base of supplies; fortify it so that the storehousescould be held by a small garrison, and move from there along the line ofrailroad, repairing as we advanced, to the Yallabusha, or to Jackson,Mississippi.  At this time the North had become very much discouraged.Many strong Union men believed that the war must prove a failure.  Theelections of 1862 had gone against the party which was for theprosecution of the war to save the Union if it took the last man and thelast dollar.  Voluntary enlistments had ceased throughout the greaterpart of the North, and the draft had been resorted to to fill up ourranks.  It was my judgment at the time that to make a backward movementas long as that from Vicksburg to Memphis, would be interpreted, by manyof those yet full of hope for the preservation of the Union, as adefeat, and that the draft would be resisted, desertions ensue and thepower to capture and punish deserters lost. There was nothing left to bedone but to go FORWARD TO A DECISIVE VICTORY.  This was in my mind fromthe moment I took command in person at Young's Point.The winter of 1862-3 was a noted one for continuous high water in theMississippi and for heavy rains along the lower river. To get dry land,or rather land above the water, to encamp the troops upon, took manymiles of river front.  We had to occupy the levees and the groundimmediately behind.  This was so limited that one corps, the 17th, underGeneral McPherson, was at Lake Providence, seventy miles aboveVicksburg.It was in January the troops took their position opposite Vicksburg.The water was very high and the rains were incessant.  There seemed nopossibility of a land movement before the end of March or later, and itwould not do to lie idle all this time.  The effect would bedemoralizing to the troops and injurious to their health.  Friends inthe North would have grown more and more discouraged, and enemies in thesame section more and more insolent in their gibes and denunciation ofthe cause and those engaged in it.I always admired the South, as bad as I thought their cause, for theboldness with which they silenced all opposition and all croaking, bypress or by individuals, within their control.  War at all times,whether a civil war between sections of a common country or betweennations, ought to be avoided, if possible with honor.  But, once enteredinto, it is too much for human nature to tolerate an enemy within theirranks to give aid and comfort to the armies of the opposing section ornation.Vicksburg, as stated before, is on the first high land coming to theriver's edge, below that on which Memphis stands.  The bluff, or highland, follows the left bank of the Yazoo for some distance and continuesin a southerly direction to the Mississippi River, thence it runs alongthe Mississippi to Warrenton, six miles below.  The Yazoo River leavesthe high land a short distance below Haines' Bluff and empties into theMississippi nine miles above Vicksburg.  Vicksburg is built on this highland where the Mississippi washes the base of the hill.  Haines' Bluff,eleven miles from Vicksburg, on the Yazoo River, was strongly fortified.The whole distance from there to Vicksburg and thence to Warrenton wasalso intrenched, with batteries at suitable distances and rifle-pitsconnecting them.From Young's Point the Mississippi turns in a north-easterly directionto a point just above the city, when it again turns and runssouth-westerly, leaving vessels, which might attempt to run the blockade,exposed to the fire of batteries six miles below the city before theywere in range of the upper batteries.  Since then the river has made acut-off, leaving what was the peninsula in front of the city, an island.North of the Yazoo was all a marsh, heavily timbered, cut up withbayous, and much overflowed.  A front attack was therefore impossible,and was never contemplated; certainly not by me. The problem thenbecame, how to secure a landing on high ground east of the Mississippiwithout an apparent retreat.  Then commenced a series of experiments toconsume time, and to divert the attention of the enemy, of my troops andof the public generally.  I, myself, never felt great confidence thatany of the experiments resorted to would prove successful. NeverthelessI was always prepared to take advantage of them in case they did.In 1862 General Thomas Williams had come up from New Orleans and cut aditch ten or twelve feet wide and about as deep, straight across fromYoung's Point to the river below.  The distance across was a little overa mile.  It was Williams' expectation that when the river rose it wouldcut a navigable channel through; but the canal started in an eddy fromboth ends, and, of course, it only filled up with water on the risewithout doing any execution in the way of cutting.  Mr. Lincoln hadnavigated the Mississippi in his younger days and understood well itstendency to change its channel, in places, from time to time.  He setmuch store accordingly by this canal.  General McClernand had been,therefore, directed before I went to Young's Point to push the work ofwidening and deepening this canal.  After my arrival the work wasdiligently pushed with about 4,000 men--as many as could be used toadvantage--until interrupted by a sudden rise in the river that broke adam at the upper end, which had been put there to keep the water outuntil the excavation was completed.  This was on the 8th of March.Even if the canal had proven a success, so far as to be navigable forsteamers, it could not have been of much advantage to us.  It runs in adirection almost perpendicular to the line of bluffs on the oppositeside, or east bank, of the river.  As soon as the enemy discovered whatwe were doing he established a battery commanding the canal throughoutits length.  This battery soon drove out our dredges, two in number,which were doing the work of thousands of men.  Had the canal beencompleted it might have proven of some use in running transportsthrough, under the cover of night, to use below; but they would yet haveto run batteries, though for a much shorter distance.While this work was progressing we were busy in other directions, tryingto find an available landing on high ground on the east bank of theriver, or to make water-ways to get below the city, avoiding thebatteries.On the 30th of January, the day after my arrival at the front, I orderedGeneral McPherson, stationed with his corps at Lake Providence, to cutthe levee at that point.  If successful in opening a channel fornavigation by this route, it would carry us to the Mississippi Riverthrough the mouth of the Red River, just above Port Hudson and fourhundred miles below Vicksburg by the river.Lake Providence is a part of the old bed of the Mississippi, about amile from the present channel.  It is six miles long and has its outletthrough Bayou Baxter, Bayou Macon, and the Tensas, Washita and RedRivers.  The last three are navigable streams at all seasons.  BayousBaxter and Macon are narrow and tortuous, and the banks are covered withdense forests overhanging the channel.  They were also filled withfallen timber, the accumulation of years.  The land along theMississippi River, from Memphis down, is in all instances highest nextto the river, except where the river washes the bluffs which form theboundary of the valley through which it winds.  Bayou Baxter, as itreaches lower land, begins to spread out and disappears entirely in acypress swamp before it reaches the Macon.  There was about two feet ofwater in this swamp at the time.  To get through it, even with vesselsof the lightest draft, it was necessary to clear off a belt of heavytimber wide enough to make a passage way.  As the trees would have to becut close to the bottom--under water--it was an undertaking of greatmagnitude.On the 4th of February I visited General McPherson, and remained withhim several days.  The work had not progressed so far as to admit thewater from the river into the lake, but the troops had succeeded indrawing a small steamer, of probably not over thirty tons' capacity,from the river into the lake.  With this we were able to explore thelake and bayou as far as cleared.  I saw then that there was scarcely achance of this ever becoming a practicable route for moving troopsthrough an enemy's country.  The distance from Lake Providence to thepoint where vessels going by that route would enter the Mississippiagain, is about four hundred and seventy miles by the main river.  Thedistance would probably be greater by the tortuous bayous through whichthis new route would carry us.  The enemy held Port Hudson, below wherethe Red River debouches, and all the Mississippi above to Vicksburg.The Red River, Washita and Tensas were, as has been said, all navigablestreams, on which the enemy could throw small bodies of men to obstructour passage and pick off our troops with their sharpshooters.  I let thework go on, believing employment was better than idleness for the men.Then, too, it served as a cover for other efforts which gave a betterprospect of success.  This work was abandoned after the canal proved afailure.Lieutenant-Colonel Wilson of my staff was sent to Helena, Arkansas, toexamine and open a way through Moon Lake and the Yazoo Pass if possible.Formerly there was a route by way of an inlet from the Mississippi Riverinto Moon Lake, a mile east of the river, thence east through Yazoo Passto Coldwater, along the latter to the Tallahatchie, which joins theYallabusha about two hundred and fifty miles below Moon Lake and formsthe Yazoo River.  These were formerly navigated by steamers trading withthe rich plantations along their banks; but the State of Mississippi hadbuilt a strong levee across the inlet some years before, leaving theonly entrance for vessels into this rich region the one by way of themouth of the Yazoo several hundreds of miles below.On the 2d of February this dam, or levee, was cut.  The river being highthe rush of water through the cut was so great that in a very short timethe entire obstruction was washed away. The bayous were soon filled andmuch of the country was overflowed. This pass leaves the MississippiRiver but a few miles below Helena. On the 24th General Ross, with hisbrigade of about 4,500 men on transports, moved into this new water-way.The rebels had obstructed the navigation of Yazoo Pass and the Coldwaterby felling trees into them.  Much of the timber in this region being ofgreater specific gravity than water, and being of great size, theirremoval was a matter of great labor; but it was finally accomplished,and on the 11th of March Ross found himself, accompanied by two gunboatsunder the command of Lieutenant-Commander Watson Smith, confronting afortification at Greenwood, where the Tallahatchie and Yallabusha uniteand the Yazoo begins.  The bends of the rivers are such at this point asto almost form an island, scarcely above water at that stage of theriver.  This island was fortified and manned.  It was named FortPemberton after the commander at Vicksburg.  No land approach wasaccessible.  The troops, therefore, could render no assistance towardsan assault further than to establish a battery on a little piece ofground which was discovered above water.  The gunboats, however,attacked on the 11th and again on the 13th of March.  Both efforts werefailures and were not renewed.  One gunboat was disabled and we lost sixmen killed and twenty-five wounded. The loss of the enemy was less.Fort Pemberton was so little above the water that it was thought that arise of two feet would drive the enemy out.  In hope of enlisting theelements on our side, which had been so much against us up to this time,a second cut was made in the Mississippi levee, this time directlyopposite Helena, or six miles above the former cut.  It did notaccomplish the desired result, and Ross, with his fleet, started back.On the 22d he met Quinby with a brigade at Yazoo Pass.  Quinby was thesenior of Ross, and assumed command.  He was not satisfied withreturning to his former position without seeing for himself whetheranything could be accomplished.  Accordingly Fort Pemberton wasrevisited by our troops; but an inspection was sufficient this timewithout an attack.  Quinby, with his command, returned with but littledelay.  In the meantime I was much exercised for the safety of Ross, notknowing that Quinby had been able to join him.  Reinforcements were ofno use in a country covered with water, as they would have to remain onboard of their transports.  Relief had to come from another quarter.  SoI determined to get into the Yazoo below Fort Pemberton.Steel's Bayou empties into the Yazoo River between Haines' Bluff and itsmouth.  It is narrow, very tortuous, and fringed with a very heavygrowth of timber, but it is deep.  It approaches to within one mile ofthe Mississippi at Eagle Bend, thirty miles above Young's Point.Steel's Bayou connects with Black Bayou, Black Bayou with Deer Creek,Deer Creek with Rolling Fork, Rolling Fork with the Big Sunflower River,and the Big Sunflower with the Yazoo River about ten miles above Haines'Bluff in a right line but probably twenty or twenty-five miles by thewinding of the river.  All these waterways are of about the same natureso far as navigation is concerned, until the Sunflower is reached; thisaffords free navigation.Admiral Porter explored this waterway as far as Deer Creek on the 14thof March, and reported it navigable.  On the next day he started withfive gunboats and four mortar-boats.  I went with him for some distance.The heavy overhanging timber retarded progress very much, as did alsothe short turns in so narrow a stream.  The gunboats, however, ploughedtheir way through without other damage than to their appearance.  Thetransports did not fare so well although they followed behind. The roadwas somewhat cleared for them by the gunboats.  In the evening Ireturned to headquarters to hurry up reinforcements. Sherman went inperson on the 16th, taking with him Stuart's division of the 15th corps.They took large river transports to Eagle Bend on the Mississippi, wherethey debarked and marched across to Steel's Bayou, where theyre-embarked on the transports.  The river steamers, with their tallsmokestacks and light guards extending out, were so much impeded thatthe gunboats got far ahead.  Porter, with his fleet, got within a fewhundred yards of where the sailing would have been clear and free fromthe obstructions caused by felling trees into the water, when heencountered rebel sharp-shooters, and his progress was delayed byobstructions in his front.  He could do nothing with gunboats againstsharpshooters.  The rebels, learning his route, had sent in about 4,000men--many more than there were sailors in the fleet.Sherman went back, at the request of the admiral, to clear out BlackBayou and to hurry up reinforcements, which were far behind.  On thenight of the 19th he received notice from the admiral that he had beenattacked by sharp-shooters and was in imminent peril.  Sherman at oncereturned through Black Bayou in a canoe, and passed on until he met asteamer, with the last of the reinforcements he had, coming up.  Theytried to force their way through Black Bayou with their steamer, but,finding it slow and tedious work, debarked and pushed forward on foot.It was night when they landed, and intensely dark.  There was but anarrow strip of land above water, and that was grown up with underbrushor cane.  The troops lighted their way through this with candles carriedin their hands for a mile and a half, when they came to an openplantation.  Here the troops rested until morning.  They made twenty-onemiles from this resting-place by noon the next day, and were in time torescue the fleet.  Porter had fully made up his mind to blow up thegunboats rather than have them fall into the hands of the enemy.  Morewelcome visitors he probably never met than the 'boys in blue' on thisoccasion.  The vessels were backed out and returned to their rendezvouson the Mississippi; and thus ended in failure the fourth attempt to getin rear of Vicksburg.
ISFP	XXXII.THE BAYOUS WEST OF THE MISSISSIPPI--CRITICISMS OF THE  NORTHERN PRESS--RUNNING THE BATTERIES--LOSS OF THE INDIANOLA--DISPOSITION OF THETROOPS.The original canal scheme was also abandoned on the 27th of March.  Theeffort to make a waterway through Lake Providence and the connectingbayous was abandoned as wholly impracticable about the same time.At Milliken's Bend, and also at Young's Point, bayous or channels start,which connecting with other bayous passing Richmond, Louisiana, enterthe Mississippi at Carthage twenty-five or thirty miles above GrandGulf.  The Mississippi levee cuts the supply of water off from thesebayous or channels, but all the rainfall behind the levee, at thesepoints, is carried through these same channels to the river below.  Incase of a crevasse in this vicinity, the water escaping would find itsoutlet through the same channels.  The dredges and laborers from thecanal having been driven out by overflow and the enemy's batteries, Idetermined to open these other channels, if possible.  If successful theeffort would afford a route, away from the enemy's batteries, for ourtransports.  There was a good road back of the levees, along thesebayous, to carry the troops, artillery and wagon trains over wheneverthe water receded a little, and after a few days of dry weather.Accordingly, with the abandonment of all the other plans for reaching abase heretofore described, this new one was undertaken.As early as the 4th of February I had written to Halleck about thisroute, stating that I thought it much more practicable than the otherundertaking (the Lake Providence route), and that it would have beenaccomplished with much less labor if commenced before the water had gotall over the country.The upper end of these bayous being cut off from a water supply, furtherthan the rainfall back of the levees, was grown up with dense timber fora distance of several miles from their source.  It was necessary,therefore, to clear this out before letting in the water from the river.This work was continued until the waters of the river began to recedeand the road to Richmond, Louisiana, emerged from the water.  One smallsteamer and some barges were got through this channel, but no furtheruse could be made of it because of the fall in the river. Beyond this itwas no more successful than the other experiments with which the winterwas whiled away.  All these failures would have been very discouragingif I had expected much from the efforts; but I had not.  From the firstthe most I hoped to accomplish was the passage of transports, to be usedbelow Vicksburg, without exposure to the long line of batteriesdefending that city.This long, dreary and, for heavy and continuous rains and high water,unprecedented winter was one of great hardship to all engaged aboutVicksburg.  The river was higher than its natural banks from December,1862, to the following April.  The war had suspended peaceful pursuitsin the South, further than the production of army supplies, and inconsequence the levees were neglected and broken in many places and thewhole country was covered with water.  Troops could scarcely find dryground on which to pitch their tents.  Malarial fevers broke out amongthe men.  Measles and small-pox also attacked them.  The hospitalarrangements and medical attendance were so perfect, however, that theloss of life was much less than might have been expected.  Visitors tothe camps went home with dismal stories to relate; Northern papers cameback to the soldiers with these stories exaggerated.  Because I wouldnot divulge my ultimate plans to visitors, they pronounced me idle,incompetent and unfit to command men in an emergency, and clamored formy removal.  They were not to be satisfied, many of them, with my simpleremoval, but named who my successor should be. McClernand, Fremont,Hunter and McClellan were all mentioned in this connection.  I took nosteps to answer these complaints, but continued to do my duty, as Iunderstood it, to the best of my ability.  Every one has hissuperstitions.  One of mine is that in positions of great responsibilityevery one should do his duty to the best of his ability where assignedby competent authority, without application or the use of influence tochange his position.  While at Cairo I had watched with very greatinterest the operations of the Army of the Potomac, looking upon that asthe main field of the war.  I had no idea, myself, of ever having anylarge command, nor did I suppose that I was equal to one; but I had thevanity to think that as a cavalry officer I might succeed very well inthe command of a brigade. On one occasion, in talking about this to mystaff officers, all of whom were civilians without any militaryeducation whatever, I said that I would give anything if I werecommanding a brigade of cavalry in the Army of the Potomac and Ibelieved I could do some good.  Captain Hillyer spoke up and suggestedthat I make application to be transferred there to command the cavalry.I then told him that I would cut my right arm off first, and mentionedthis superstition.In time of war the President, being by the ConstitutionCommander-in-chief of the Army and Navy, is responsible for theselection of commanders.  He should not be embarrassed in making hisselections.  I having been selected, my responsibility ended with mydoing the best I knew how.  If I had sought the place, or obtained itthrough personal or political influence, my belief is that I would havefeared to undertake any plan of my own conception, and would probablyhave awaited direct orders from my distant superiors.  Persons obtainingimportant commands by application or political influence are apt to keepa written record of complaints and predictions of defeat, which areshown in case of disaster.  Somebody must be responsible for theirfailures.With all the pressure brought to bear upon them, both President Lincolnand General Halleck stood by me to the end of the campaign.  I had nevermet Mr.  Lincoln, but his support was constant.At last the waters began to recede; the roads crossing the peninsulabehind the levees of the bayous, were emerging from the waters; thetroops were all concentrated from distant points at Milliken's Bendpreparatory to a final move which was to crown the long, tedious anddiscouraging labors with success.I had had in contemplation the whole winter the movement by land to apoint below Vicksburg from which to operate, subject only to thepossible but not expected success of some one of the expedients resortedto for the purpose of giving us a different base.  This could not beundertaken until the waters receded.  I did not therefore communicatethis plan, even to an officer of my staff, until it was necessary tomake preparations for the start.  My recollection is that Admiral Porterwas the first one to whom I mentioned it.  The co-operation of the navywas absolutely essential to the success (even to the contemplation) ofsuch an enterprise.  I had no more authority to command Porter than hehad to command me.  It was necessary to have part of his fleet belowVicksburg if the troops went there.  Steamers to use as ferries werealso essential.  The navy was the only escort and protection for thesesteamers, all of which in getting below had to run about fourteen milesof batteries. Porter fell into the plan at once, and suggested that hehad better superintend the preparation of the steamers selected to runthe batteries, as sailors would probably understand the work better thansoldiers.  I was glad to accept his proposition, not only because Iadmitted his argument, but because it would enable me to keep from theenemy a little longer our designs. Porter's fleet was on the east sideof the river above the mouth of the Yazoo, entirely concealed from theenemy by the dense forests that intervened.  Even spies could not getnear him, on account of the undergrowth and overflowed lands.Suspicions of some mysterious movements were aroused.  Our river guardsdiscovered one day a small skiff moving quietly and mysteriously up theriver near the east shore, from the direction of Vicksburg, towards thefleet.  On overhauling the boat they found a small white flag, not muchlarger than a handkerchief, set up in the stern, no doubt intended as aflag of truce in case of discovery.  The boat, crew and passengers werebrought ashore to me.  The chief personage aboard proved to be JacobThompson, Secretary of the Interior under the administration ofPresident Buchanan.  After a pleasant conversation of half an hour ormore I allowed the boat and crew, passengers and all, to return toVicksburg, without creating a suspicion that there was a doubt in mymind as to the good faith of Mr. Thompson and his flag.Admiral Porter proceeded with the preparation of the steamers for theirhazardous passage of the enemy's batteries.  The great essential was toprotect the boilers from the enemy's shot, and to conceal the firesunder the boilers from view.  This he accomplished by loading thesteamers, between the guards and boilers on the boiler deck up to thedeck above, with bales of hay and cotton, and the deck in front of theboilers in the same way, adding sacks of grain.  The hay and grain wouldbe wanted below, and could not be transported in sufficient quantity bythe muddy roads over which we expected to march.Before this I had been collecting, from St. Louis and Chicago, yawls andbarges to be used as ferries when we got below.  By the 16th of AprilPorter was ready to start on his perilous trip.  The advance, flagshipBenton, Porter commanding, started at ten o'clock at night, followed atintervals of a few minutes by the Lafayette with a captured steamer, thePrice, lashed to her side, the Louisville, Mound City, Pittsburgh andCarondelet--all of these being naval vessels.  Next came the transports--Forest Queen, Silver Wave and Henry Clay, each towing barges loadedwith coal to be used as fuel by the naval and transport steamers whenbelow the batteries.  The gunboat Tuscumbia brought up the rear.  Soonafter the start a battery between Vicksburg and Warrenton opened fireacross the intervening peninsula, followed by the upper batteries, andthen by batteries all along the line.  The gunboats ran up close underthe bluffs, delivering their fire in return at short distances, probablywithout much effect.  They were under fire for more than two hours andevery vessel was struck many times, but with little damage to thegunboats.  The transports did not fare so well.  The Henry Clay wasdisabled and deserted by her crew. Soon after a shell burst in thecotton packed about the boilers, set the vessel on fire and burned herto the water's edge.  The burning mass, however, floated down toCarthage before grounding, as did also one of the barges in tow.The enemy were evidently expecting our fleet, for they were ready tolight up the river by means of bonfires on the east side and by firinghouses on the point of land opposite the city on the Louisiana side.The sight was magnificent, but terrible.  I witnessed it from the deckof a river transport, run out into the middle of the river and as lowdown as it was prudent to go.  My mind was much relieved when I learnedthat no one on the transports had been killed and but few, if any,wounded.  During the running of the batteries men were stationed in theholds of the transports to partially stop with cotton shot-holes thatmight be made in the hulls.  All damage was afterwards soon repairedunder the direction of Admiral Porter.The experiment of passing batteries had been tried before this, however,during the war.  Admiral Farragut had run the batteries at Port Hudsonwith the flagship Hartford and one iron-clad and visited me from belowVicksburg.  The 13th of February Admiral Porter had sent the gunboatIndianola, Lieutenant-Commander George Brown commanding, below.  She metColonel Ellet of the Marine brigade below Natchez on a captured steamer.Two of the Colonel's fleet had previously run the batteries, producingthe greatest consternation among the people along the Mississippi fromVicksburg (*10) to the Red River.The Indianola remained about the mouth of the Red River some days, andthen started up the Mississippi.  The Confederates soon raised the Queenof the West, (*11) and repaired her.  With this vessel and the ram Webb,which they had had for some time in the Red River, and two othersteamers, they followed the Indianola. The latter was encumbered withbarges of coal in tow, and consequently could make but little speedagainst the rapid current of the Mississippi.  The Confederate fleetovertook her just above Grand Gulf, and attacked her after dark on the24th of February.  The Indianola was superior to all the others inarmament, and probably would have destroyed them or driven them away,but for her encumbrance.  As it was she fought them for an hour and ahalf, but, in the dark, was struck seven or eight times by the ram andother vessels, and was finally disabled and reduced to a sinkingcondition.  The armament was thrown overboard and the vessel run ashore.Officers and crew then surrendered.I had started McClernand with his corps of four divisions on the 29th ofMarch, by way of Richmond, Louisiana, to New Carthage, hoping that hemight capture Grand Gulf before the balance of the troops could getthere; but the roads were very bad, scarcely above water yet.  Somemiles from New Carthage the levee to Bayou Vidal was broken in severalplaces, overflowing the roads for the distance of two miles.  Boats werecollected from the surrounding bayous, and some constructed on the spotfrom such material as could be collected, to transport the troops acrossthe overflowed interval.  By the 6th of April McClernand had reached NewCarthage with one division and its artillery, the latter ferried throughthe woods by these boats.  On the 17th I visited New Carthage in person,and saw that the process of getting troops through in the way we weredoing was so tedious that a better method must be devised.  The waterwas falling, and in a few days there would not be depth enough to useboats; nor would the land be dry enough to march over.  McClernand hadalready found a new route from Smith's plantation where the crevasseoccurred, to Perkins' plantation, eight to twelve miles below NewCarthage.  This increased the march from Milliken's Bend fromtwenty-seven to nearly forty miles.  Four bridges had to be built acrossbayous, two of them each over six hundred feet long, making about twothousand feet of bridging in all.  The river falling made the current inthese bayous very rapid, increasing the difficulty of building andpermanently fastening these bridges; but the ingenuity of the 'Yankeesoldier' was equal to any emergency.  The bridges were soon built ofsuch material as could be found near by, and so substantial were theythat not a single mishap occurred in crossing all the army withartillery, cavalry and wagon trains, except the loss of one siege gun(a thirty-two pounder).  This, if my memory serves me correctly, brokethrough the only pontoon bridge we had in all our march across thepeninsula. These bridges were all built by McClernand's command, underthe supervision of Lieutenant Hains of the Engineer Corps.I returned to Milliken's Bend on the 18th or 19th, and on the 20thissued the following final order for the movement of troops:HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE TENNESSEE, MILLIKEN'S BEND, LOUISIANA,April 20, 1863.Special Orders, No. 110. *         *         *         *         * ** VIII.  The following orders are published for the information andguidance of the 'Army in the Field,' in its present movement to obtain afoothold on the east bank of the Mississippi River, from which Vicksburgcan be approached by practicable roads.First.--The Thirteenth army corps, Major-General John A. McClernandcommanding, will constitute the right wing.Second.--The Fifteenth army corps, Major-General W. T. Shermancommanding, will constitute the left wing.Third.--The Seventeenth army corps, Major-General James B. McPhersoncommanding, will constitute the centre.Fourth.--The order of march to New Carthage will be from right to left.Fifth.--Reserves will be formed by divisions from each army corps; or,an entire army corps will be held as a reserve, as necessity mayrequire.  When the reserve is formed by divisions, each division willremain under the immediate command of its respective corps commander,unless otherwise specially ordered for a particular emergency.Sixth.--Troops will be required to bivouac, until proper facilities canbe afforded for the transportation of camp equipage.Seventh.--In the present movement, one tent will be allowed to eachcompany for the protection of rations from rain; one wall tent for eachregimental headquarters; one wall tent for each brigade headquarters;and one wall tent for each division headquarters; corps commandershaving the books and blanks of their respective commands to provide for,are authorized to take such tents as are absolutely necessary, but notto exceed the number allowed by General Orders No. 160, A. G. O., seriesof 1862.Eighth.--All the teams of the three army corps, under the immediatecharge of the quartermasters bearing them on their returns, willconstitute a train for carrying supplies and ordnance and the authorizedcamp equipage of the army.Ninth.--As fast as the Thirteenth army corps advances, the Seventeentharmy corps will take its place; and it, in turn, will be followed inlike manner by the Fifteenth army corps.Tenth.--Two regiments from each army corps will be detailed by corpscommanders, to guard the lines from Richmond to New Carthage.Eleventh.--General hospitals will be established by the medical directorbetween Duckport and Milliken's Bend.  All sick and disabled soldierswill be left in these hospitals.  Surgeons in charge of hospitals willreport convalescents as fast as they become fit for duty.  Each corpscommander will detail an intelligent and good drill officer, to remainbehind and take charge of the convalescents of their respective corps;officers so detailed will organize the men under their charge intosquads and companies, without regard to the regiments they belong to;and in the absence of convalescent commissioned officers to commandthem, will appoint non-commissioned officers or privates.  The force soorganized will constitute the guard of the line from Duckport toMilliken's Bend.  They will furnish all the guards and details requiredfor general hospitals, and with the contrabands that may be about thecamps, will furnish all the details for loading and unloading boats.Twelfth.--The movement of troops from Milliken's Bend to New Carthagewill be so conducted as to allow the transportation of ten days' supplyof rations, and one-half the allowance of ordnance, required by previousorders.Thirteenth.--Commanders are authorized and enjoined to collect all thebeef cattle, corn and other necessary supplies on the line of march; butwanton destruction of property, taking of articles useless for militarypurposes, insulting citizens, going into and searching houses withoutproper orders from division commanders, are positively prohibited.  Allsuch irregularities must be summarily punished.Fourteenth.--Brigadier-General J. C.  Sullivan is appointed to thecommand of all the forces detailed for the protection of the line fromhere to New Carthage.  His particular attention is called to GeneralOrders, No. 69, from Adjutant-General's Office, Washington, of dateMarch 20, 1863.By order of MAJOR-GENERAL U. S.  GRANT.McClernand was already below on the Mississippi.  Two of McPherson'sdivisions were put upon the march immediately.  The third had not yetarrived from Lake Providence; it was on its way to Milliken's Bend andwas to follow on arrival.Sherman was to follow McPherson.  Two of his divisions were at Duckportand Young's Point, and the third under Steele was under orders to returnfrom Greenville, Mississippi, where it had been sent to expel a rebelbattery that had been annoying our transports.It had now become evident that the army could not be rationed by a wagontrain over the single narrow and almost impassable road betweenMilliken's Bend and Perkins' plantation.  Accordingly six more steamerswere protected as before, to run the batteries, and were loaded withsupplies.  They took twelve barges in tow, loaded also with rations.  Onthe night of the 22d of April they ran the batteries, five gettingthrough more or less disabled while one was sunk.  About half the bargesgot through with their needed freight.When it was first proposed to run the blockade at Vicksburg with riversteamers there were but two captains or masters who were willing toaccompany their vessels, and but one crew. Volunteers were called forfrom the army, men who had had experience in any capacity in navigatingthe western rivers. Captains, pilots, mates, engineers and deck-handsenough presented themselves to take five times the number of vessels wewere moving through this dangerous ordeal.  Most of them were fromLogan's division, composed generally of men from the southern part ofIllinois and from Missouri.  All but two of the steamers were commandedby volunteers from the army, and all but one so manned.  In thisinstance, as in all others during the war, I found that volunteers couldbe found in the ranks and among the commissioned officers to meet everycall for aid whether mechanical or professional.  Colonel W. S. Oliverwas master of transportation on this occasion by special detail.
ISFP	 XXXIII.ATTACK ON GRAND GULF--OPERATIONS BELOW VICKSBURG.On the 24th my headquarters were with the advance at Perkins'plantation.  Reconnoissances were made in boats to ascertain whetherthere was high land on the east shore of the river where we might landabove Grand Gulf.  There was none practicable. Accordingly the troopswere set in motion for Hard Times, twenty-two miles farther down theriver and nearly opposite Grand Gulf.  The loss of two steamers and sixbarges reduced our transportation so that only 10,000 men could be movedby water. Some of the steamers that had got below were injured in theirmachinery, so that they were only useful as barges towed by those lessseverely injured.  All the troops, therefore, except what could betransported in one trip, had to march.  The road lay west of Lake St.Joseph.  Three large bayous had to be crossed.  They were rapidlybridged in the same manner as those previously encountered. (*12)On the 27th McClernand's corps was all at Hard Times, and McPherson'swas following closely.  I had determined to make the attempt to effect alanding on the east side of the river as soon as possible.  Accordingly,on the morning of the 29th, McClernand was directed to embark all thetroops from his corps that our transports and barges could carry.  About10,000 men were so embarked.  The plan was to have the navy silence theguns at Grand Gulf, and to have as many men as possible ready to debarkin the shortest possible time under cover of the fire of the navy andcarry the works by storm.  The following order was issued:PERKINS PLANTATION, LA., April 27,1863.MAJOR-GENERAL J. A. MCCLERNAND, Commanding 13th A. C.Commence immediately the embarkation of your corps, or so much of it asthere is transportation for.  Have put aboard the artillery and everyarticle authorized in orders limiting baggage, except the men, and holdthem in readiness, with their places assigned, to be moved at a moment'swarning.All the troops you may have, except those ordered to remain behind, sendto a point nearly opposite Grand Gulf, where you see, by special ordersof this date, General McPherson is ordered to send one division.The plan of the attack will be for the navy to attack and silence allthe batteries commanding the river.  Your corps will be on the river,ready to run to and debark on the nearest eligible land below thepromontory first brought to view passing down the river.  Once on shore,have each commander instructed beforehand to form his men the best theground will admit of, and take possession of the most commanding points,but avoid separating your command so that it cannot support itself.  Thefirst object is to get a foothold where our troops can maintainthemselves until such time as preparations can be made and troopscollected for a forward movement.Admiral Porter has proposed to place his boats in the position indicatedto you a few days ago, and to bring over with them such troops as may bebelow the city after the guns of the enemy are silenced.It may be that the enemy will occupy positions back from the city, outof range of the gunboats, so as to make it desirable to run past GrandGulf and land at Rodney.  In case this should prove the plan, a signalwill be arranged and you duly informed, when the transports are to startwith this view.  Or, it may be expedient for the boats to run past, butnot the men.  In this case, then, the transports would have to bebrought back to where the men could land and move by forced marches tobelow Grand Gulf, re-embark rapidly and proceed to the latter place.There will be required, then, three signals; one, to indicate that thetransports can run down and debark the troops at Grand Gulf; one, thatthe transports can run by without the troops; and the last, that thetransports can run by with the troops on board.Should the men have to march, all baggage and artillery will be left torun the blockade.If not already directed, require your men to keep three days' rations intheir haversacks, not to be touched until a movement commences.U. S. GRANT, Major-General.At 8 o'clock A.M., 29th, Porter made the attack with his entire strengthpresent, eight gunboats.  For nearly five and a half hours the attackwas kept up without silencing a single gun of the enemy.  All this timeMcClernand's 10,000 men were huddled together on the transports in thestream ready to attempt a landing if signalled.  I occupied a tug fromwhich I could see the effect of the battle on both sides, within rangeof the enemy's guns; but a small tug, without armament, was notcalculated to attract the fire of batteries while they were beingassailed themselves.  About half-past one the fleet withdrew, seeingtheir efforts were entirely unavailing.  The enemy ceased firing as soonas we withdrew.  I immediately signalled the Admiral and went aboard hisship.  The navy lost in this engagement eighteen killed and fifty-sixwounded.  A large proportion of these were of the crew of the flagship,and most of those from a single shell which penetrated the ship's sideand exploded between decks where the men were working their guns.  Thesight of the mangled and dying men which met my eye as I boarded theship was sickening.Grand Gulf is on a high bluff where the river runs at the very foot ofit.  It is as defensible upon its front as Vicksburg and, at that time,would have been just as impossible to capture by a front attack.  Itherefore requested Porter to run the batteries with his fleet thatnight, and to take charge of the transports, all of which would bewanted below.There is a long tongue of land from the Louisiana side extending towardsGrand Gulf, made by the river running nearly east from about three milesabove and nearly in the opposite direction from that point for about thesame distance below.  The land was so low and wet that it would not havebeen practicable to march an army across but for a levee.  I had hadthis explored before, as well as the east bank below to ascertain ifthere was a possible point of debarkation north of Rodney.  It was foundthat the top of the levee afforded a good road to march upon.Porter, as was always the case with him, not only acquiesced in theplan, but volunteered to use his entire fleet as transports.  I hadintended to make this request, but he anticipated me.  At dusk, whenconcealed from the view of the enemy at Grand Gulf, McClernand landedhis command on the west bank.  The navy and transports ran the batteriessuccessfully. The troops marched across the point of land under cover ofnight, unobserved.  By the time it was light the enemy saw our wholefleet, ironclads, gunboats, river steamers and barges, quietly movingdown the river three miles below them, black, or rather blue, withNational troops.When the troops debarked, the evening of the 29th, it was expected thatwe would have to go to Rodney, about nine miles below, to find alanding; but that night a colored man came in who informed me that agood landing would be found at Bruinsburg, a few miles above Rodney,from which point there was a good road leading to Port Gibson sometwelve miles in the interior.  The information was found correct, andour landing was effected without opposition.Sherman had not left his position above Vicksburg yet.  On the morningof the 27th I ordered him to create a diversion by moving his corps upthe Yazoo and threatening an attack on Haines' Bluff.My object was to compel Pemberton to keep as much force about Vicksburgas I could, until I could secure a good footing on high land east of theriver.  The move was eminently successful and, as we afterwards learned,created great confusion about Vicksburg and doubts about our realdesign.  Sherman moved the day of our attack on Grand Gulf, the 29th,with ten regiments of his command and eight gunboats which Porter hadleft above Vicksburg.He debarked his troops and apparently made every preparation to attackthe enemy while the navy bombarded the main forts at Haines' Bluff.This move was made without a single casualty in either branch of theservice.  On the first of May Sherman received orders from me (sent fromHard Times the evening of the 29th of April) to withdraw from the frontof Haines' Bluff and follow McPherson with two divisions as fast as hecould.I had established a depot of supplies at Perkins' plantation. Now thatall our gunboats were below Grand Gulf it was possible that the enemymight fit out boats in the Big Black with improvised armament andattempt to destroy these supplies. McPherson was at Hard Times with aportion of his corps, and the depot was protected by a part of hiscommand.  The night of the 29th I directed him to arm one of thetransports with artillery and send it up to Perkins' plantation as aguard; and also to have the siege guns we had brought along moved thereand put in position.The embarkation below Grand Gulf took place at De Shroon's, Louisiana,six miles above Bruinsburg, Mississippi.  Early on the morning of 30thof April McClernand's corps and one division of McPherson's corps werespeedily landed.When this was effected I felt a degree of relief scarcely ever equalledsince.  Vicksburg was not yet taken it is true, nor were its defendersdemoralized by any of our previous moves.  I was now in the enemy'scountry, with a vast river and the stronghold of Vicksburg between meand my base of supplies.  But I was on dry ground on the same side ofthe river with the enemy.  All the campaigns, labors, hardships andexposures from the month of December previous to this time that had beenmade and endured, were for the accomplishment of this one object.I had with me the 13th corps, General McClernand commanding, and twobrigades of Logan's division of the 17th corps, General McPhersoncommanding--in all not more than twenty thousand men to commence thecampaign with.  These were soon reinforced by the remaining brigade ofLogan's division and Crocker's division of the 17th corps.  On the 7thof May I was further reinforced by Sherman with two divisions of his,the 15th corps.  My total force was then about thirty-three thousandmen.The enemy occupied Grand Gulf, Haines' Bluff and Jackson with a force ofnearly sixty thousand men.  Jackson is fifty miles east of Vicksburg andis connected with it by a railroad.  My first problem was to captureGrand Gulf to use as a base.Bruinsburg is two miles from high ground.  The bottom at that point ishigher than most of the low land in the valley of the Mississippi, and agood road leads to the bluff.  It was natural to expect the garrisonfrom Grand Gulf to come out to meet us and prevent, if they could, ourreaching this solid base.  Bayou Pierre enters the Mississippi justabove Bruinsburg and, as it is a navigable stream and was high at thetime, in order to intercept us they had to go by Port Gibson, thenearest point where there was a bridge to cross upon.  This more thandoubled the distance from Grand Gulf to the high land back ofBruinsburg.  No time was to be lost in securing this foothold. Ourtransportation was not sufficient to move all the army across the riverat one trip, or even two; but the landing of the 13th corps and onedivision of the 17th was effected during the day, April 30th, and earlyevening.  McClernand was advanced as soon as ammunition and two days'rations (to last five) could be issued to his men.  The bluffs werereached an hour before sunset and McClernand was pushed on, hoping toreach Port Gibson and save the bridge spanning the Bayou Pierre beforethe enemy could get there; for crossing a stream in the presence of anenemy is always difficult.  Port Gibson, too, is the starting point ofroads to Grand Gulf, Vicksburg and Jackson.McClernand's advance met the enemy about five miles west of Port Gibsonat Thompson's plantation.  There was some firing during the night, butnothing rising to the dignity of a battle until daylight.  The enemy hadtaken a strong natural position with most of the Grand Gulf garrison,numbering about seven or eight thousand men, under General Bowen.  Hishope was to hold me in check until reinforcements under Loring couldreach him from Vicksburg; but Loring did not come in time to render muchassistance south of Port Gibson.  Two brigades of McPherson's corpsfollowed McClernand as fast as rations and ammunition could be issued,and were ready to take position upon the battlefield whenever the 13thcorps could be got out of the way.The country in this part of Mississippi stands on edge, as it were, theroads running along the ridges except when they occasionally pass fromone ridge to another.  Where there are no clearings the sides of thehills are covered with a very heavy growth of timber and withundergrowth, and the ravines are filled with vines and canebrakes,almost impenetrable.  This makes it easy for an inferior force to delay,if not defeat, a far superior one.Near the point selected by Bowen to defend, the road to Port Gibsondivides, taking two ridges which do not diverge more than a mile or twoat the widest point.  These roads unite just outside the town.  Thismade it necessary for McClernand to divide his force.  It was not onlydivided, but it was separated by a deep ravine of the character abovedescribed.  One flank could not reinforce the other except by marchingback to the junction of the roads.  McClernand put the divisions ofHovey, Carr and A. J. Smith upon the right-hand branch and Osterhaus onthe left.  I was on the field by ten A.M., and inspected both flanks inperson.  On the right the enemy, if not being pressed back, was at leastnot repulsing our advance.  On the left, however, Osterhaus was notfaring so well.  He had been repulsed with some loss.  As soon as theroad could be cleared of McClernand's troops I ordered up McPherson, whowas close upon the rear of the 13th corps, with two brigades of Logan'sdivision.  This was about noon.  I ordered him to send one brigade(General John E. Smith's was selected) to support Osterhaus, and to moveto the left and flank the enemy out of his position.  This movementcarried the brigade over a deep ravine to a third ridge and, whenSmith's troops were seen well through the ravine, Osterhaus was directedto renew his front attack.  It was successful and unattended by heavyloss.  The enemy was sent in full retreat on their right, and their leftfollowed before sunset.  While the movement to our left was going on,McClernand, who was with his right flank, sent me frequent requests forreinforcements, although the force with him was not being pressed.  Ihad been upon the ground and knew it did not admit of his engaging allthe men he had.  We followed up our victory until night overtook usabout two miles from Port Gibson; then the troops went into bivouac forthe night.
ISFP	 XXXIV.CAPTURE OF PORT GIBSON--GRIERSON'S RAID--OCCUPATION OF GRAND GULF--MOVEMENT UP THE BIG BLACK--BATTLE OF RAYMOND.We started next morning for Port Gibson as soon as it was light enoughto see the road.  We were soon in the town, and I was delighted to findthat the enemy had not stopped to contest our crossing further at thebridge, which he had burned.  The troops were set to work at once toconstruct a bridge across the South Fork of the Bayou Pierre.  At thistime the water was high and the current rapid.  What might be called araft-bridge was soon constructed from material obtained from woodenbuildings, stables, fences, etc., which sufficed for carrying the wholearmy over safely.  Colonel J. H. Wilson, a member of my staff, plannedand superintended the construction of this bridge, going into the waterand working as hard as any one engaged.  Officers and men generallyjoined in this work.  When it was finished the army crossed and marchedeight miles beyond to the North Fork that day.  One brigade of Logan'sdivision was sent down the stream to occupy the attention of a rebelbattery, which had been left behind with infantry supports to preventour repairing the burnt railroad bridge.  Two of his brigades were sentup the bayou to find a crossing and reach the North Fork to repair thebridge there.  The enemy soon left when he found we were building abridge elsewhere.  Before leaving Port Gibson we were reinforced byCrocker's division, McPherson's corps, which had crossed the Mississippiat Bruinsburg and come up without stopping except to get two days'rations.  McPherson still had one division west of the MississippiRiver, guarding the road from Milliken's Bend to the river below untilSherman's command should relieve it.On leaving Bruinsburg for the front I left my son Frederick, who hadjoined me a few weeks before, on board one of the gunboats asleep, andhoped to get away without him until after Grand Gulf should fall intoour hands; but on waking up he learned that I had gone, and being guidedby the sound of the battle raging at Thompson's Hill--called the Battleof Port Gibson--found his way to where I was.  He had no horse to rideat the time, and I had no facilities for even preparing a meal.  He,therefore, foraged around the best he could until we reached Grand Gulf.Mr. C. A. Dana, then an officer of the War Department, accompanied me onthe Vicksburg campaign and through a portion of the siege.  He was inthe same situation as Fred so far as transportation and messarrangements were concerned.  The first time I call to mind seeingeither of them, after the battle, they were mounted on two enormoushorses, grown white from age, each equipped with dilapidated saddles andbridles.Our trains arrived a few days later, after which we were all perfectlyequipped.My son accompanied me throughout the campaign and siege, and caused noanxiety either to me or to his mother, who was at home.  He looked outfor himself and was in every battle of the campaign.  His age, then notquite thirteen, enabled him to take in all he saw, and to retain arecollection of it that would not be possible in more mature years.When the movement from Bruinsburg commenced we were without a wagontrain.  The train still west of the Mississippi was carried around withproper escort, by a circuitous route from Milliken's Bend to Hard Timesseventy or more miles below, and did not get up for some days after thebattle of Port Gibson. My own horses, headquarters' transportation,servants, mess chest, and everything except what I had on, was with thistrain. General A. J. Smith happened to have an extra horse at Bruinsburgwhich I borrowed, with a saddle-tree without upholstering further thanstirrups.  I had no other for nearly a week.It was necessary to have transportation for ammunition. Provisions couldbe taken from the country; but all the ammunition that can be carried onthe person is soon exhausted when there is much fighting.  I directed,therefore, immediately on landing that all the vehicles and draftanimals, whether horses, mules, or oxen, in the vicinity should becollected and loaded to their capacity with ammunition.  Quite a trainwas collected during the 30th, and a motley train it was.  In it couldbe found fine carriages, loaded nearly to the top with boxes ofcartridges that had been pitched in promiscuously, drawn by mules withplough, harness, straw collars, rope-lines, etc.; long-coupled wagons,with racks for carrying cotton bales, drawn by oxen, and everything thatcould be found in the way of transportation on a plantation, either foruse or pleasure.  The making out of provision returns was stopped forthe time.  No formalities were to retard our progress until a positionwas secured when the time could be spared to observe them.It was at Port Gibson I first heard through a Southern paper of thecomplete success of Colonel Grierson, who was making a raid throughcentral Mississippi.  He had started from La Grange April 17th withthree regiments of about 1,700 men.  On the 21st he had detached ColonelHatch with one regiment to destroy the railroad between Columbus andMacon and then return to La Grange.  Hatch had a sharp fight with theenemy at Columbus and retreated along the railroad, destroying it atOkalona and Tupelo, and arriving in La Grange April 26.  Griersoncontinued his movement with about 1,000 men, breaking the Vicksburg andMeridian railroad and the New Orleans and Jackson railroad, arriving atBaton Rouge May 2d.  This raid was of great importance, for Grierson hadattracted the attention of the enemy from the main movement againstVicksburg.During the night of the 2d of May the bridge over the North Fork wasrepaired, and the troops commenced crossing at five the next morning.Before the leading brigade was over it was fired upon by the enemy froma commanding position; but they were soon driven off.  It was evidentthat the enemy was covering a retreat from Grand Gulf to Vicksburg.Every commanding position from this (Grindstone) crossing to Hankinson'sferry over the Big Black was occupied by the retreating foe to delay ourprogress. McPherson, however, reached Hankinson's ferry before night,seized the ferry boat, and sent a detachment of his command across andseveral miles north on the road to Vicksburg.  When the junction of theroad going to Vicksburg with the road from Grand Gulf to Raymond andJackson was reached, Logan with his division was turned to the lefttowards Grand Gulf.  I went with him a short distance from thisjunction.  McPherson had encountered the largest force yet met since thebattle of Port Gibson and had a skirmish nearly approaching a battle;but the road Logan had taken enabled him to come up on the enemy's rightflank, and they soon gave way.  McPherson was ordered to holdHankinson's ferry and the road back to Willow Springs with one division;McClernand, who was now in the rear, was to join in this as well as toguard the line back down the bayou.  I did not want to take the chancesof having an enemy lurking in our rear.On the way from the junction to Grand Gulf, where the road comes intothe one from Vicksburg to the same place six or seven miles out, Ilearned that the last of the enemy had retreated past that place ontheir way to Vicksburg.  I left Logan to make the proper disposition ofhis troops for the night, while I rode into the town with an escort ofabout twenty cavalry.  Admiral Porter had already arrived with hisfleet.  The enemy had abandoned his heavy guns and evacuated the place.When I reached Grand Gulf May 3d I had not been with my baggage sincethe 27th of April and consequently had had no change of underclothing,no meal except such as I could pick up sometimes at other headquarters,and no tent to cover me.  The first thing I did was to get a bath,borrow some fresh underclothing from one of the naval officers andget a good meal on the flag-ship.  Then I wrote letters to thegeneral-in-chief informing him of our present position, dispatches to betelegraphed from Cairo, orders to General Sullivan commanding aboveVicksburg, and gave orders to all my corps commanders.  About twelveo'clock at night I was through my work and started for Hankinson'sferry, arriving there before daylight.  While at Grand Gulf I heard fromBanks, who was on the Red River, and who said that he could not be atPort Hudson before the 10th of May and then with only 15,000 men.  Up tothis time my intention had been to secure Grand Gulf, as a base ofsupplies, detach McClernand's corps to Banks and co-operate with him inthe reduction of Port Hudson.The news from Banks forced upon me a different plan of campaign from theone intended.  To wait for his co-operation would have detained me atleast a month.  The reinforcements would not have reached ten thousandmen after deducting casualties and necessary river guards at all highpoints close to the river for over three hundred miles.  The enemy wouldhave strengthened his position and been reinforced by more men thanBanks could have brought. I therefore determined to move independentlyof Banks, cut loose from my base, destroy the rebel force in rear ofVicksburg and invest or capture the city.Grand Gulf was accordingly given up as a base and the authorities atWashington were notified.  I knew well that Halleck's caution would leadhim to disapprove of this course; but it was the only one that gave anychance of success.  The time it would take to communicate withWashington and get a reply would be so great that I could not beinterfered with until it was demonstrated whether my plan waspracticable.  Even Sherman, who afterwards ignored bases of suppliesother than what were afforded by the country while marching through fourStates of the Confederacy with an army more than twice as large as mineat this time, wrote me from Hankinson's ferry, advising me of theimpossibility of supplying our army over a single road.  He urged me to'stop all troops till your army is partially supplied with wagons, andthen act as quick as possible; for this road will be jammed, as sure aslife.'  To this I replied:  'I do not calculate upon the possibility ofsupplying the army with full rations from Grand Gulf.  I know it will beimpossible without constructing additional roads.  What I do expect isto get up what rations of hard bread, coffee and salt we can, and makethe country furnish the balance.'  We started from Bruinsburg with anaverage of about two days' rations, and received no more from our ownsupplies for some days; abundance was found in the mean time.  A delaywould give the enemy time to reinforce and fortify.McClernand's and McPherson's commands were kept substantially as theywere on the night of the 2d, awaiting supplies sufficient to give themthree days' rations in haversacks.  Beef, mutton, poultry and foragewere found in abundance.  Quite a quantity of bacon and molasses wasalso secured from the country, but bread and coffee could not beobtained in quantity sufficient for all the men.  Every plantation,however, had a run of stone, propelled by mule power, to grind corn forthe owners and their slaves.  All these were kept running while we werestopping, day and night, and when we were marching, during the night, atall plantations covered by the troops.  But the product was taken by thetroops nearest by, so that the majority of the command was destined togo without bread until a new base was established on the Yazoo aboveVicksburg.While the troops were awaiting the arrival of rations I orderedreconnoissances made by McClernand and McPherson, with the view ofleading the enemy to believe that we intended to cross the Big Black andattack the city at once.On the 6th Sherman arrived at Grand Gulf and crossed his command thatnight and the next day.  Three days' rations had been brought up fromGrand Gulf for the advanced troops and were issued.  Orders were givenfor a forward movement the next day.  Sherman was directed to order upBlair, who had been left behind to guard the road from Milliken's Bendto Hard Times with two brigades.The quartermaster at Young's Point was ordered to send two hundredwagons with Blair, and the commissary was to load them with hard bread,coffee, sugar, salt and one hundred thousand pounds of salt meat.On the 3d Hurlbut, who had been left at Memphis, was ordered to sendfour regiments from his command to Milliken's Bend to relieve Blair'sdivision, and on the 5th he was ordered to send Lauman's division inaddition, the latter to join the army in the field.  The four regimentswere to be taken from troops near the river so that there would be nodelay.During the night of the 6th McPherson drew in his troops north of theBig Black and was off at an early hour on the road to Jackson, via RockySprings, Utica and Raymond.  That night he and McClernand were both atRocky Springs ten miles from Hankinson's ferry.  McPherson remainedthere during the 8th, while McClernand moved to Big Sandy and Shermanmarched from Grand Gulf to Hankinson's ferry.  The 9th, McPherson movedto a point within a few miles west of Utica; McClernand and Shermanremained where they were.  On the 10th McPherson moved to Utica, Shermanto Big Sandy; McClernand was still at Big Sandy.  The 11th, McClernandwas at Five Mile Creek; Sherman at Auburn; McPherson five miles advancedfrom Utica. May 12th, McClernand was at Fourteen Mile Creek; Sherman atFourteen Mile Creek; McPherson at Raymond after a battle.After McPherson crossed the Big Black at Hankinson's ferry Vicksburgcould have been approached and besieged by the south side.  It is notprobable, however, that Pemberton would have permitted a closebesiegement.  The broken nature of the ground would have enabled him tohold a strong defensible line from the river south of the city to theBig Black, retaining possession of the railroad back to that point.  Itwas my plan, therefore, to get to the railroad east of Vicksburg, andapproach from that direction.  Accordingly, McPherson's troops that hadcrossed the Big Black were withdrawn and the movement east to Jacksoncommenced.As has been stated before, the country is very much broken and the roadsgenerally confined to the tops of the hills.  The troops were moved one(sometimes two) corps at a time to reach designated points out parallelto the railroad and only from six to ten miles from it.  McClernand'scorps was kept with its left flank on the Big Black guarding all thecrossings.  Fourteen Mile Creek, a stream substantially parallel withthe railroad, was reached and crossings effected by McClernand andSherman with slight loss.  McPherson was to the right of Sherman,extending to Raymond.  The cavalry was used in this advance inreconnoitring to find the roads:  to cover our advances and to find themost practicable routes from one command to another so they couldsupport each other in case of an attack.  In making this move Iestimated Pemberton's movable force at Vicksburg at about eighteenthousand men, with smaller forces at Haines' Bluff and Jackson.  Itwould not be possible for Pemberton to attack me with all his troops atone place, and I determined to throw my army between his and fight himin detail.  This was done with success, but I found afterwards that Ihad entirely under-estimated Pemberton's strength.Up to this point our movements had been made without serious opposition.My line was now nearly parallel with the Jackson and Vicksburg railroadand about seven miles south of it.  The right was at Raymond eighteenmiles from Jackson, McPherson commanding; Sherman in the centre onFourteen Mile Creek, his advance thrown across; McClernand to the left,also on Fourteen Mile Creek, advance across, and his pickets within twomiles of Edward's station, where the enemy had concentrated aconsiderable force and where they undoubtedly expected us to attack.McClernand's left was on the Big Black.  In all our moves, up to thistime, the left had hugged the Big Black closely, and all the ferries hadbeen guarded to prevent the enemy throwing a force on our rear.McPherson encountered the enemy, five thousand strong with two batteriesunder General Gregg, about two miles out of Raymond. This was about twoP.M.  Logan was in advance with one of his brigades.  He deployed andmoved up to engage the enemy. McPherson ordered the road in rear to becleared of wagons, and the balance of Logan's division, and Crocker's,which was still farther in rear, to come forward with all dispatch.  Theorder was obeyed with alacrity.  Logan got his division in position forassault before Crocker could get up, and attacked with vigor, carryingthe enemy's position easily, sending Gregg flying from the field not toappear against our front again until we met at Jackson.In this battle McPherson lost 66 killed, 339 wounded, and 37 missing--nearly or quite all from Logan's division.  The enemy's loss was 100killed, 305 wounded, besides 415 taken prisoners.I regarded Logan and Crocker as being as competent division commandersas could be found in or out of the army and both equal to a much highercommand.  Crocker, however, was dying of consumption when hevolunteered.  His weak condition never put him on the sick report whenthere was a battle in prospect, as long as he could keep on his feet.He died not long after the close of the rebellion.
ISFP	 XXXV.MOVEMENT AGAINST JACKSON--FALL OF JACKSON--INTERCEPTING THE ENEMY--BATTLE OF CHAMPION'S HILL.When the news reached me of McPherson's victory at Raymond about sundownmy position was with Sherman.  I decided at once to turn the wholecolumn towards Jackson and capture that place without delay.Pemberton was now on my left, with, as I supposed, about 18,000 men; infact, as I learned afterwards, with nearly 50,000.  A force was alsocollecting on my right, at Jackson, the point where all the railroadscommunicating with Vicksburg connect. All the enemy's supplies of menand stores would come by that point.  As I hoped in the end to besiegeVicksburg I must first destroy all possibility of aid.  I thereforedetermined to move swiftly towards Jackson, destroy or drive any forcein that direction and then turn upon Pemberton.  But by moving againstJackson, I uncovered my own communication.  So I finally decided to havenone--to cut loose altogether from my base and move my whole forceeastward.  I then had no fears for my communications, and if I movedquickly enough could turn upon Pemberton before he could attack me inthe rear.Accordingly, all previous orders given during the day for movements onthe 13th were annulled by new ones.  McPherson was ordered at daylightto move on Clinton, ten miles from Jackson; Sherman was notified of mydetermination to capture Jackson and work from there westward.  He wasordered to start at four in the morning and march to Raymond.McClernand was ordered to march with three divisions by Dillon's toRaymond.  One was left to guard the crossing of the Big Black.On the 10th I had received a letter from Banks, on the Red River, askingreinforcements.  Porter had gone to his assistance with a part of hisfleet on the 3d, and I now wrote to him describing my position anddeclining to send any troops.  I looked upon side movements as long asthe enemy held Port Hudson and Vicksburg as a waste of time andmaterial.General Joseph E. Johnston arrived at Jackson in the night of the 13thfrom Tennessee, and immediately assumed command of all the Confederatetroops in Mississippi.  I knew he was expecting reinforcements from thesouth and east. On the 6th I had written to General Halleck:'Information from the other side leaves me to believe the enemy arebringing forces from Tullahoma.'Up to this time my troops had been kept in supporting distances of eachother, as far as the nature of the country would admit.  Reconnoissanceswere constantly made from each corps to enable them to acquaintthemselves with the most practicable routes from one to another in casea union became necessary.McPherson reached Clinton with the advance early on the 13th andimmediately set to work destroying the railroad.  Sherman's advancereached Raymond before the last of McPherson's command had got out ofthe town.  McClernand withdrew from the front of the enemy, at Edward'sstation, with much skill and without loss, and reached his position forthe night in good order.  On the night of the 13th, McPherson wasordered to march at early dawn upon Jackson, only fifteen miles away.Sherman was given the same order; but he was to move by the direct roadfrom Raymond to Jackson, which is south of the road McPherson was on anddoes not approach within two miles of it at the point where it crossedthe line of intrenchments which, at that time, defended the city.McClernand was ordered to move one division of his command to Clinton,one division a few miles beyond Mississippi Springs following Sherman'sline, and a third to Raymond.  He was also directed to send his siegeguns, four in number with the troops going by Mississippi Springs.McClernand's position was an advantageous one in any event. With onedivision at Clinton he was in position to reinforce McPherson, atJackson, rapidly if it became necessary; the division beyond MississippiSprings was equally available to reinforce Sherman; the one at Raymondcould take either road. He still had two other divisions farther backnow that Blair had come up, available within a day at Jackson.  If thislast command should not be wanted at Jackson, they were already oneday's march from there on their way to Vicksburg and on three differentroads leading to the latter city.  But the most important considerationin my mind was to have a force confronting Pemberton if he should comeout to attack my rear. This I expected him to do; as shown further on,he was directed by Johnston to make this very move.I notified General Halleck that I should attack the State capital on the14th.  A courier carried the dispatch to Grand Gulf through anunprotected country.Sherman and McPherson communicated with each other during the night andarranged to reach Jackson at about the same hour.  It rained in torrentsduring the night of the 13th and the fore part of the day of the 14th.The roads were intolerable, and in some places on Sherman's line, wherethe land was low, they were covered more than a foot deep with water.But the troops never murmured.  By nine o'clock Crocker, of McPherson'scorps, who was now in advance, came upon the enemy's pickets andspeedily drove them in upon the main body.  They were outside of theintrenchments in a strong position, and proved to be the troops that hadbeen driven out of Raymond.  Johnston had been reinforced; during thenight by Georgia and South Carolina regiments, so that his forceamounted to eleven thousand men, and he was expecting still more.Sherman also came upon the rebel pickets some distance out from thetown, but speedily drove them in.  He was now on the south andsouth-west of Jackson confronting the Confederates behind theirbreastworks, while McPherson's right was nearly two miles north,occupying a line running north and south across the Vicksburg railroad.Artillery was brought up and reconnoissances made preparatory to anassault. McPherson brought up Logan's division while he deployedCrocker's for the assault.  Sherman made similar dispositions on theright.  By eleven A.M. both were ready to attack.  Crocker moved hisdivision forward, preceded by a strong skirmish line.  These troops atonce encountered the enemy's advance and drove it back on the main body,when they returned to their proper regiment and the whole divisioncharged, routing the enemy completely and driving him into this mainline.  This stand by the enemy was made more than two miles outside ofhis main fortifications. McPherson followed up with his command untilwithin range of the guns of the enemy from their intrenchments, when hehalted to bring his troops into line and reconnoitre to determine thenext move.  It was now about noon.While this was going on Sherman was confronting a rebel battery whichenfiladed the road on which he was marching--the Mississippi Springsroad--and commanded a bridge spanning a stream over which he had topass.  By detaching right and left the stream was forced and the enemyflanked and speedily driven within the main line.  This brought ourwhole line in front of the enemy's line of works, which was continuouson the north, west and south sides from the Pearl River north of thecity to the same river south.  I was with Sherman.  He was confronted bya force sufficient to hold us back.  Appearances did not justify anassault where we were.  I had directed Sherman to send a force to theright, and to reconnoitre as far as to the Pearl River.  This force,Tuttle's division, not returning I rode to the right with my staff, andsoon found that the enemy had left that part of the line.  Tuttle'smovement or McPherson's pressure had no doubt led Johnston to order aretreat, leaving only the men at the guns to retard us while he wasgetting away.  Tuttle had seen this and, passing through the lineswithout resistance, came up in the rear of the artillerists confrontingSherman and captured them with ten pieces of artillery.  I rodeimmediately to the State House, where I was soon followed by Sherman.About the same time McPherson discovered that the enemy was leaving hisfront, and advanced Crocker, who was so close upon the enemy that theycould not move their guns or destroy them.  He captured seven guns and,moving on, hoisted the National flag over the rebel capital ofMississippi.  Stevenson's brigade was sent to cut off the rebel retreat,but was too late or not expeditious enough.Our loss in this engagement was:  McPherson, 37 killed, 228 wounded;Sherman, 4 killed and 21 wounded and missing.  The enemy lost 845killed, wounded and captured.  Seventeen guns fell into our hands, andthe enemy destroyed by fire their store-houses, containing a largeamount of commissary stores.On this day Blair reached New Auburn and joined McClernand's 4thdivision.  He had with him two hundred wagons loaded with rations, theonly commissary supplies received during the entire campaign.I slept that night in the room that Johnston was said to have occupiedthe night before.About four in the afternoon I sent for the corps commanders and directedthe dispositions to be made of their troops.  Sherman was to remain inJackson until he destroyed that place as a railroad centre, andmanufacturing city of military supplies. He did the work mosteffectually.  Sherman and I went together into a manufactory which hadnot ceased work on account of the battle nor for the entrance of Yankeetroops.  Our presence did not seem to attract the attention of eitherthe manager or the operatives, most of whom were girls.  We looked onfor a while to see the tent cloth which they were making roll out of thelooms, with 'C. S. A.'  woven in each bolt.  There was an immense amountof cotton, in bales, stacked outside.  Finally I told Sherman I thoughtthey had done work enough.  The operatives were told they could leaveand take with them what cloth they could carry.  In a few minutes cottonand factory were in a blaze. The proprietor visited Washington while Iwas President to get his pay for this property, claiming that it wasprivate.  He asked me to give him a statement of the fact that hisproperty had been destroyed by National troops, so that he might use itwith Congress where he was pressing, or proposed to press, his claim.  Ideclined.On the night of the 13th Johnston sent the following dispatch toPemberton at Edward's station:  'I have lately arrived, and learn thatMajor-General Sherman is between us with four divisions at Clinton.  Itis important to establish communication, that you may be reinforced.  Ifpracticable, come up in his rear at once.  To beat such a detachmentwould be of immense value.  All the troops you can quickly assembleshould be brought.  Time is all-important.'  This dispatch was sent intriplicate, by different messengers.  One of the messengers happened tobe a loyal man who had been expelled from Memphis some months before byHurlbut for uttering disloyal and threatening sentiments. There was agood deal of parade about his expulsion, ostensibly as a warning tothose who entertained the sentiments he expressed; but Hurlbut and theexpelled man understood each other.  He delivered his copy of Johnston'sdispatch to McPherson who forwarded it to me.Receiving this dispatch on the 14th I ordered McPherson to move promptlyin the morning back to Bolton, the nearest point where Johnston couldreach the road.  Bolton is about twenty miles west of Jackson.  I alsoinformed McClernand of the capture of Jackson and sent him the followingorder:  'It is evidently the design of the enemy to get north of us andcross the Big Black, and beat us into Vicksburg.  We must not allow themto do this.  Turn all your forces towards Bolton station, and make alldispatch in getting there.  Move troops by the most direct road fromwherever they may be on the receipt of this order.'And to Blair I wrote:  'Their design is evidently to cross the Big Blackand pass down the peninsula between the Big Black and Yazoo rivers.  Wemust beat them.  Turn your troops immediately to Bolton; take all thetrains with you.  Smith's division, and any other troops now with you,will go to the same place.  If practicable, take parallel roads, so asto divide your troops and train.'Johnston stopped on the Canton road only six miles north of Jackson, thenight of the 14th.  He sent from there to Pemberton dispatchesannouncing the loss of Jackson, and the following order:'As soon as the reinforcements are all up, they must be united to therest of the army.  I am anxious to see a force assembled that may beable to inflict a heavy blow upon the enemy.  Can Grant supply himselffrom the Mississippi?  Can you not cut him off from it, and above all,should he be compelled to fall back for want of supplies, beat him.'The concentration of my troops was easy, considering the character ofthe country.  McPherson moved along the road parallel with and near therailroad.  McClernand's command was, one division (Hovey's) on the roadMcPherson had to take, but with a start of four miles.  One (Osterhaus)was at Raymond, on a converging road that intersected the other nearChampion's Hill; one (Carr's) had to pass over the same road withOsterhaus, but being back at Mississippi Springs, would not be detainedby it; the fourth (Smith's) with Blair's division, was near Auburn witha different road to pass over.  McClernand faced about and movedpromptly.  His cavalry from Raymond seized Bolton by half-past nine inthe morning, driving out the enemy's pickets and capturing several men.The night of the 15th Hovey was at Bolton; Carr and Osterhaus were aboutthree miles south, but abreast, facing west; Smith was north of Raymondwith Blair in his rear.McPherson's command, with Logan in front, had marched at seven o'clock,and by four reached Hovey and went into camp; Crocker bivouacked just inHovey's rear on the Clinton road.  Sherman with two divisions, was inJackson, completing the destruction of roads, bridges and militaryfactories.  I rode in person out to Clinton.  On my arrival I orderedMcClernand to move early in the morning on Edward's station, cautioninghim to watch for the enemy and not bring on an engagement unless he feltvery certain of success.I naturally expected that Pemberton would endeavor to obey the orders ofhis superior, which I have shown were to attack us at Clinton.  This,indeed, I knew he could not do; but I felt sure he would make theattempt to reach that point.  It turned out, however, that he haddecided his superior's plans were impracticable, and consequentlydetermined to move south from Edward's station and get between me and mybase.  I, however, had no base, having abandoned it more than a weekbefore.  On the 15th Pemberton had actually marched south from Edward'sstation, but the rains had swollen Baker's Creek, which he had to crossso much that he could not ford it, and the bridges were washed away.This brought him back to the Jackson road, on which there was a goodbridge over Baker's Creek.  Some of his troops were marching untilmidnight to get there.  Receiving here early on the 16th a repetition ofhis order to join Johnston at Clinton, he concluded to obey, and sent adispatch to his chief, informing him of the route by which he might beexpected.About five o'clock in the morning (16th) two men, who had been employedon the Jackson and Vicksburg railroad, were brought to me.  Theyreported that they had passed through Pemberton's army in the night, andthat it was still marching east. They reported him to have eightyregiments of infantry and ten batteries; in all, about twenty-fivethousand men.I had expected to leave Sherman at Jackson another day in order tocomplete his work; but getting the above information I sent him ordersto move with all dispatch to Bolton, and to put one division with anammunition train on the road at once, with directions to its commanderto march with all possible speed until he came up to our rear.  Withinan hour after receiving this order Steele's division was on the road.At the same time I dispatched to Blair, who was near Auburn, to movewith all speed to Edward's station.  McClernand was directed to embraceBlair in his command for the present.  Blair's division was a part ofthe 15th army corps (Sherman's); but as it was on its way to join itscorps, it naturally struck our left first, now that we had faced aboutand were moving west. The 15th corps, when it got up, would be on ourextreme right.  McPherson was directed to get his trains out of the wayof the troops, and to follow Hovey's division as closely as possible.McClernand had two roads about three miles apart, converging at Edward'sstation, over which to march his troops.  Hovey's division of his corpshad the advance on a third road (the Clinton) still farther north.McClernand was directed to move Blair's and A. J. Smith's divisions bythe southernmost of these roads, and Osterhaus and Carr by the middleroad.  Orders were to move cautiously with skirmishers to the front tofeel for the enemy.Smith's division on the most southern road was the first to encounterthe enemy's pickets, who were speedily driven in. Osterhaus, on themiddle road, hearing the firing, pushed his skirmishers forward, foundthe enemy's pickets and forced them back to the main line.  About thesame time Hovey encountered the enemy on the northern or direct wagonroad from Jackson to Vicksburg.  McPherson was hastening up to joinHovey, but was embarrassed by Hovey's trains occupying the roads.  I wasstill back at Clinton.  McPherson sent me word of the situation, andexpressed the wish that I was up.  By half-past seven I was on the roadand proceeded rapidly to the front, ordering all trains that were infront of troops off the road.  When I arrived Hovey's skirmishingamounted almost to a battle.McClernand was in person on the middle road and had a shorter distanceto march to reach the enemy's position than McPherson.  I sent him wordby a staff officer to push forward and attack.  These orders wererepeated several times without apparently expediting McClernand'sadvance.Champion's Hill, where Pemberton had chosen his position to receive us,whether taken by accident or design, was well selected.  It is one ofthe highest points in that section, and commanded all the ground inrange.  On the east side of the ridge, which is quite precipitous, is aravine running first north, then westerly, terminating at Baker's Creek.It was grown up thickly with large trees and undergrowth, making itdifficult to penetrate with troops, even when not defended.  The ridgeoccupied by the enemy terminated abruptly where the ravine turnswesterly.  The left of the enemy occupied the north end of this ridge.The Bolton and Edward's station wagon-road turns almost due south atthis point and ascends the ridge, which it follows for about a mile;then turning west, descends by a gentle declivity to Baker's Creek,nearly a mile away.  On the west side the slope of the ridge is gradualand is cultivated from near the summit to the creek.  There was, when wewere there, a narrow belt of timber near the summit west of the road.From Raymond there is a direct road to Edward's station, some threemiles west of Champion's Hill.  There is one also to Bolton.  From thislatter road there is still another, leaving it about three and a halfmiles before reaching Bolton and leads direct to the same station.  Itwas along these two roads that three divisions of McClernand's corps,and Blair of Sherman's, temporarily under McClernand, were moving.Hovey of McClernand's command was with McPherson, farther north on theroad from Bolton direct to Edward's station.  The middle road comes intothe northern road at the point where the latter turns to the west anddescends to Baker's Creek; the southern road is still several milessouth and does not intersect the others until it reaches Edward'sstation.  Pemberton's lines covered all these roads, and faced east.Hovey's line, when it first drove in the enemy's pickets, was formedparallel to that of the enemy and confronted his left.By eleven o'clock the skirmishing had grown into a hard-contestedbattle.  Hovey alone, before other troops could be got to assist him,had captured a battery of the enemy.  But he was not able to hold hisposition and had to abandon the artillery.  McPherson brought up histroops as fast as possible, Logan in front, and posted them on the rightof Hovey and across the flank of the enemy.  Logan reinforced Hovey withone brigade from his division; with his other two he moved farther westto make room for Crocker, who was coming up as rapidly as the roadswould admit.  Hovey was still being heavily pressed, and was calling onme for more reinforcements.  I ordered Crocker, who was now coming up,to send one brigade from his division. McPherson ordered two batteriesto be stationed where they nearly enfiladed the enemy's line, and theydid good execution.From Logan's position now a direct forward movement carried him overopen fields, in rear of the enemy and in a line parallel with them.  Hedid make exactly this move, attacking, however, the enemy through thebelt of woods covering the west slope of the hill for a short distance.Up to this time I had kept my position near Hovey where we were the mostheavily pressed; but about noon I moved with a part of my staff by ourright around, until I came up with Logan himself.  I found him near theroad leading down to Baker's Creek.  He was actually in command of theonly road over which the enemy could retreat; Hovey, reinforced by twobrigades from McPherson's command, confronted the enemy's left; Crocker,with two brigades, covered their left flank; McClernand two hoursbefore, had been within two miles and a half of their centre with twodivisions, and the two divisions, Blair's and A. J. Smith's, wereconfronting the rebel right; Ransom, with a brigade of McArthur'sdivision of the 17th corps (McPherson's), had crossed the river at GrandGulf a few days before, and was coming up on their right flank.  NeitherLogan nor I knew that we had cut off the retreat of the enemy.  Just atthis juncture a messenger came from Hovey, asking for morereinforcements.  There were none to spare.  I then gave an order to moveMcPherson's command by the left flank around to Hovey. This uncoveredthe rebel line of retreat, which was soon taken advantage of by theenemy.During all this time, Hovey, reinforced as he was by a brigade fromLogan and another from Crocker, and by Crocker gallantly coming up withtwo other brigades on his right, had made several assaults, the last oneabout the time the road was opened to the rear.  The enemy fledprecipitately.  This was between three and four o'clock.  I rodeforward, or rather back, to where the middle road intersects the northroad, and found the skirmishers of Carr's division just coming in.Osterhaus was farther south and soon after came up with skirmishersadvanced in like manner.  Hovey's division, and McPherson's twodivisions with him, had marched and fought from early dawn, and were notin the best condition to follow the retreating foe.  I sent orders toOsterhaus to pursue the enemy, and to Carr, whom I saw personally, Iexplained the situation and directed him to pursue vigorously as far asthe Big Black, and to cross it if he could; Osterhaus to follow him.The pursuit was continued until after dark.The battle of Champion's Hill lasted about four hours, hard fighting,preceded by two or three hours of skirmishing, some of which almost roseto the dignity of battle.  Every man of Hovey's division and ofMcPherson's two divisions was engaged during the battle.  No other partof my command was engaged at all, except that as described before.Osterhaus's and A. J. Smith's divisions had encountered the rebeladvanced pickets as early as half-past seven.  Their positions wereadmirable for advancing upon the enemy's line.  McClernand, with twodivisions, was within a few miles of the battle-field long before noonand in easy hearing.  I sent him repeated orders by staff officers fullycompetent to explain to him the situation.  These traversed the woodseparating us, without escort, and directed him to push forward; but hedid not come.  It is true, in front of McClernand there was a smallforce of the enemy and posted in a good position behind a ravineobstructing his advance; but if he had moved to the right by the road mystaff officers had followed the enemy must either have fallen back orbeen cut off.  Instead of this he sent orders to Hovey, who belonged tohis corps, to join on to his right flank.  Hovey was bearing the bruntof the battle at the time.  To obey the order he would have had to pullout from the front of the enemy and march back as far as McClernand hadto advance to get into battle and substantially over the same ground.Of course I did not permit Hovey to obey the order of his intermediatesuperior.We had in this battle about 15,000 men absolutely engaged.  Thisexcludes those that did not get up, all of McClernand's command exceptHovey.  Our loss was 410 killed, 1,844 wounded and 187 missing.  Hoveyalone lost 1,200 killed, wounded and missing--more than one-third of hisdivision.Had McClernand come up with reasonable promptness, or had I known theground as I did afterwards, I cannot see how Pemberton could haveescaped with any organized force.  As it was he lost over three thousandkilled and wounded and about three thousand captured in battle and inpursuit.  Loring's division, which was the right of Pemberton's line,was cut off from the retreating army and never got back into Vicksburg.Pemberton himself fell back that night to the Big Black River.  Histroops did not stop before midnight and many of them left before thegeneral retreat commenced, and no doubt a good part of them returned totheir homes.  Logan alone captured 1,300 prisoners and eleven guns.Hovey captured 300 under fire and about 700 in all, exclusive of 500sick and wounded whom he paroled, thus making 1,200.McPherson joined in the advance as soon as his men could fill theircartridge-boxes, leaving one brigade to guard our wounded.  The pursuitwas continued as long as it was light enough to see the road.  The nightof the 16th of May found McPherson's command bivouacked from two to sixmiles west of the battlefield, along the line of the road to Vicksburg.Carr and Osterhaus were at Edward's station, and Blair was about threemiles south-east; Hovey remained on the field where his troops hadfought so bravely and bled so freely.  Much war material abandoned bythe enemy was picked up on the battle-field, among it thirty pieces ofartillery.  I pushed through the advancing column with my staff and keptin advance until after night. Finding ourselves alone we stopped andtook possession of a vacant house.  As no troops came up we moved back amile or more until we met the head of the column just going into bivouacon the road.  We had no tents, so we occupied the porch of a house whichhad been taken for a rebel hospital and which was filled with woundedand dying who had been brought from the battle-field we had just left.While a battle is raging one can see his enemy mowed down by thethousand, or the ten thousand, with great composure; but after thebattle these scenes are distressing, and one is naturally disposed to doas much to alleviate the suffering of an enemy as a friend.
ISFP	 XXXVI.BATTLE OF BLACK RIVER BRIDGE--CROSSING THE BIG BLACK--INVESTMENT OFVICKSBURG--ASSAULTING THE WORKS.We were now assured of our position between Johnston and Pemberton,without a possibility of a junction of their forces.  Pemberton mighthave made a night march to the Big Black, crossed the bridge there and,by moving north on the west side, have eluded us and finally returned toJohnston.  But this would have given us Vicksburg.  It would have beenhis proper move, however, and the one Johnston would have made had hebeen in Pemberton's place.  In fact it would have been in conformitywith Johnston's orders to Pemberton.Sherman left Jackson with the last of his troops about noon on the 16thand reached Bolton, twenty miles west, before halting.  His rear guarddid not get in until two A.M. the 17th, but renewed their march bydaylight.  He paroled his prisoners at Jackson, and was forced to leavehis own wounded in care of surgeons and attendants.  At Bolton he wasinformed of our victory.  He was directed to commence the march earlynext day, and to diverge from the road he was on to Bridgeport on theBig Black River, some eleven miles above the point where we expected tofind the enemy.  Blair was ordered to join him there with the pontoontrain as early as possible.This movement brought Sherman's corps together, and at a point where Ihoped a crossing of the Big Black might be effected and Sherman's corpsused to flank the enemy out of his position in our front, thus opening acrossing for the remainder of the army.  I informed him that I wouldendeavor to hold the enemy in my front while he crossed the river.The advance division, Carr's (McClernand's corps), resumed the pursuitat half-past three A.M. on the 17th, followed closely by Osterhaus,McPherson bringing up the rear with his corps.  As I expected, the enemywas found in position on the Big Black.  The point was only six milesfrom that where my advance had rested for the night, and was reached atan early hour.  Here the river makes a turn to the west, and has washedclose up to the high land; the east side is a low bottom, sometimesoverflowed at very high water, but was cleared and in cultivation.  Abayou runs irregularly across this low land, the bottom of which,however, is above the surface of the Big Black at ordinary stages.  Whenthe river is full water runs through it, converting the point of landinto an island.  The bayou was grown up with timber, which the enemy hadfelled into the ditch.  At this time there was a foot or two of water init. The rebels had constructed a parapet along the inner bank of thisbayou by using cotton bales from the plantation close by and throwingdirt over them.  The whole was thoroughly commanded from the height westof the river.  At the upper end of the bayou there was a strip ofuncleared land which afforded a cover for a portion of our men.  Carr'sdivision was deployed on our right, Lawler's brigade forming his extremeright and reaching through these woods to the river above.  Osterhaus'division was deployed to the left of Carr and covered the enemy's entirefront.  McPherson was in column on the road, the head close by, ready tocome in wherever he could be of assistance.While the troops were standing as here described an officer from Banks'staff came up and presented me with a letter from General Halleck, datedthe 11th of May.  It had been sent by the way of New Orleans to Banks tobe forwarded to me.  It ordered me to return to Grand Gulf and toco-operate from there with Banks against Port Hudson, and then to returnwith our combined forces to besiege Vicksburg.  I told the officer thatthe order came too late, and that Halleck would not give it now if heknew our position.  The bearer of the dispatch insisted that I ought toobey the order, and was giving arguments to support his position when Iheard great cheering to the right of our line and, looking in thatdirection, saw Lawler in his shirt sleeves leading a charge upon theenemy.  I immediately mounted my horse and rode in the direction of thecharge, and saw no more of the officer who delivered the dispatch; Ithink not even to this day.The assault was successful.  But little resistance was made. The enemyfled from the west bank of the river, burning the bridge behind him andleaving the men and guns on the east side to fall into our hands.  Manytried to escape by swimming the river. Some succeeded and some weredrowned in the attempt. Eighteen guns were captured and 1,751 prisoners.Our loss was 39 killed, 237 wounded and 3 missing.  The enemy probablylost but few men except those captured and drowned.  But for thesuccessful and complete destruction of the bridge, I have but littledoubt that we should have followed the enemy so closely as to preventhis occupying his defences around Vicksburg.As the bridge was destroyed and the river was high, new bridges had tobe built.  It was but little after nine o'clock A.M. when the capturetook place.  As soon as work could be commenced, orders were given forthe construction of three bridges.  One was taken charge of byLieutenant Hains, of the Engineer Corps, one by General McPhersonhimself and one by General Ransom, a most gallant and intelligentvolunteer officer.  My recollection is that Hains built a raft bridge;McPherson a pontoon, using cotton bales in large numbers, for pontoons;and that Ransom felled trees on opposite banks of the river, cuttingonly on one side of the tree, so that they would fall with their topsinterlacing in the river, without the trees being entirely severed fromtheir stumps.  A bridge was then made with these trees to support theroadway.  Lumber was taken from buildings, cotton gins and whereverfound, for this purpose.  By eight o'clock in the morning of the 18thall three bridges were complete and the troops were crossing.Sherman reached Bridgeport about noon of the 17th and found Blair withthe pontoon train already there.  A few of the enemy were intrenched onthe west bank, but they made little resistance and soon surrendered.Two divisions were crossed that night and the third the followingmorning.On the 18th I moved along the Vicksburg road in advance of the troopsand as soon as possible joined Sherman.  My first anxiety was to securea base of supplies on the Yazoo River above Vicksburg.  Sherman's lineof march led him to the very point on Walnut Hills occupied by the enemythe December before when he was repulsed.  Sherman was equally anxiouswith myself.  Our impatience led us to move in advance of the column andwell up with the advanced skirmishers.  There were some detached worksalong the crest of the hill.  These were still occupied by the enemy, orelse the garrison from Haines' Bluff had not all got past on their wayto Vicksburg.  At all events the bullets of the enemy whistled by thickand fast for a short time.  In a few minutes Sherman had the pleasure oflooking down from the spot coveted so much by him the December before onthe ground where his command had lain so helpless for offensive action.He turned to me, saying that up to this minute he had felt no positiveassurance of success.  This, however, he said was the end of one of thegreatest campaigns in history and I ought to make a report of it atonce.  Vicksburg was not yet captured, and there was no telling whatmight happen before it was taken; but whether captured or not, this wasa complete and successful campaign.  I do not claim to quote Sherman'slanguage; but the substance only.  My reason for mentioning thisincident will appear further on.McPherson, after crossing the Big Black, came into the Jackson andVicksburg road which Sherman was on, but to his rear.  He arrived atnight near the lines of the enemy, and went into camp.  McClernand movedby the direct road near the railroad to Mount Albans, and then turned tothe left and put his troops on the road from Baldwin's ferry toVicksburg.  This brought him south of McPherson.  I now had my threecorps up the works built for the defence of Vicksburg, on three roads--one to the north, one to the east and one to the south-east of the city.By the morning of the 19th the investment was as complete as my limitednumber of troops would allow.  Sherman was on the right, and covered thehigh ground from where it overlooked the Yazoo as far south-east as histroops would extend.  McPherson joined on to his left, and occupiedground on both sides of the Jackson road.  McClernand took up the groundto his left and extended as far towards Warrenton as he could, keeping acontinuous line.On the 19th there was constant skirmishing with the enemy while we weregetting into better position.  The enemy had been much demoralized byhis defeats at Champion's Hill and the Big Black, and I believed hewould not make much effort to hold Vicksburg. Accordingly, at twoo'clock I ordered an assault.  It resulted in securing more advancedpositions for all our troops where they were fully covered from the fireof the enemy.The 20th and 21st were spent in strengthening our position and in makingroads in rear of the army, from Yazoo River or Chickasaw Bayou.  Most ofthe army had now been for three weeks with only five days' rationsissued by the commissary.  They had an abundance of food, however, butbegan to feel the want of bread.  I remember that in passing around tothe left of the line on the 21st, a soldier, recognizing me, said inrather a low voice, but yet so that I heard him, 'Hard tack.'  In amoment the cry was taken up all along the line, 'Hard tack! Hard tack!'I told the men nearest to me that we had been engaged ever since thearrival of the troops in building a road over which to supply them witheverything they needed.  The cry was instantly changed to cheers.  Bythe night of the 21st all the troops had full rations issued to them.The bread and coffee were highly appreciated.I now determined on a second assault.  Johnston was in my rear, onlyfifty miles away, with an army not much inferior in numbers to the one Ihad with me, and I knew he was being reinforced. There was danger of hiscoming to the assistance of Pemberton, and after all he might defeat myanticipations of capturing the garrison if, indeed, he did not preventthe capture of the city.  The immediate capture of Vicksburg would savesending me the reinforcements which were so much wanted elsewhere, andwould set free the army under me to drive Johnston from the State.  Butthe first consideration of all was--the troops believed they could carrythe works in their front, and would not have worked so patiently in thetrenches if they had not been allowed to try.The attack was ordered to commence on all parts of the line at teno'clock A.M. on the 22d with a furious cannonade from every battery inposition.  All the corps commanders set their time by mine so that allmight open the engagement at the same minute. The attack was gallant,and portions of each of the three corps succeeded in getting up to thevery parapets of the enemy and in planting their battle flags upon them;but at no place were we able to enter.  General McClernand reported thathe had gained the enemy's intrenchments at several points, and wantedreinforcements.  I occupied a position from which I believed I could seeas well as he what took place in his front, and I did not see thesuccess he reported.  But his request for reinforcements being repeatedI could not ignore it, and sent him Quinby's division of the 17th corps.Sherman and McPherson were both ordered to renew their assaults as adiversion in favor of McClernand.  This last attack only served toincrease our casualties without giving any benefit whatever.  As soon asit was dark our troops that had reached the enemy's line and beenobliged to remain there for security all day, were withdrawn; and thusended the last assault upon Vicksburg.
ISFP	 XXXVIISIEGE OF VICKSBURG.I now determined upon a regular siege--to 'out-camp the enemy,' as itwere, and to incur no more losses.  The experience of the 22d convincedofficers and men that this was best, and they went to work on thedefences and approaches with a will.  With the navy holding the river,the investment of Vicksburg was complete.  As long as we could hold ourposition the enemy was limited in supplies of food, men and munitions ofwar to what they had on hand.  These could not last always.The crossing of troops at Bruinsburg commenced April 30th.  On the 18thof May the army was in rear of Vicksburg.  On the 19th, just twenty daysafter the crossing, the city was completely invested and an assault hadbeen made:  five distinct battles (besides continuous skirmishing) hadbeen fought and won by the Union forces; the capital of the State hadfallen and its arsenals, military manufactories and everything usefulfor military purposes had been destroyed; an average of about onehundred and eighty miles had been marched by the troops engaged; butfive days' rations had been issued, and no forage; over six thousandprisoners had been captured, and as many more of the enemy had beenkilled or wounded; twenty-seven heavy cannon and sixty-one field-pieceshad fallen into our hands; and four hundred miles of the river, fromVicksburg to Port Hudson, had become ours.  The Union force that hadcrossed the Mississippi River up to this time was less than forty-threethousand men. One division of these, Blair's, only arrived in time totake part in the battle of Champion's Hill, but was not engaged there;and one brigade, Ransom's of McPherson's corps, reached the field afterthe battle.  The enemy had at Vicksburg, Grand Gulf, Jackson, and on theroads between these places, over sixty thousand men.  They were in theirown country, where no rear guards were necessary.  The country isadmirable for defence, but difficult for the conduct of an offensivecampaign.  All their troops had to be met.  We were fortunate, to saythe least, in meeting them in detail:  at Port Gibson seven or eightthousand; at Raymond, five thousand; at Jackson, from eight to eleventhousand; at Champion's Hill, twenty-five thousand; at the Big Black,four thousand.  A part of those met at Jackson were all that was left ofthose encountered at Raymond.  They were beaten in detail by a forcesmaller than their own, upon their own ground.  Our loss up to this timewas:                             KILLED  WOUNDED  MISSING Port Gibson.....              131     719      25 South Fork Bayou Pierre.....   ..       1      ..

Total.....                    695   3,425     259Of the wounded many were but slightly so, and continued on duty.  Nothalf of them were disabled for any length of time.After the unsuccessful assault of the 22d the work of the regular siegebegan.  Sherman occupied the right starting from the river aboveVicksburg, McPherson the centre (McArthur's division now with him) andMcClernand the left, holding the road south to Warrenton.  Lauman'sdivision arrived at this time and was placed on the extreme left of theline.In the interval between the assaults of the 19th and 22d, roads had beencompleted from the Yazoo River and Chickasaw Bayou, around the rear ofthe army, to enable us to bring up supplies of food and ammunition;ground had been selected and cleared on which the troops were to beencamped, and tents and cooking utensils were brought up.  The troopshad been without these from the time of crossing the Mississippi up tothis time.  All was now ready for the pick and spade.  Prentiss andHurlbut were ordered to send forward every man that could be spared.Cavalry especially was wanted to watch the fords along the Big Black,and to observe Johnston.  I knew that Johnston was receivingreinforcements from Bragg, who was confronting Rosecrans in Tennessee.Vicksburg was so important to the enemy that I believed he would makethe most strenuous efforts to raise the siege, even at the risk oflosing ground elsewhere.My line was more than fifteen miles long, extending from Haines' Bluffto Vicksburg, thence to Warrenton.  The line of the enemy was aboutseven.  In addition to this, having an enemy at Canton and Jackson, inour rear, who was being constantly reinforced, we required a second lineof defence facing the other way.  I had not troops enough under mycommand to man these.  General Halleck appreciated the situation and,without being asked, forwarded reinforcements with all possibledispatch.The ground about Vicksburg is admirable for defence.  On the north it isabout two hundred feet above the Mississippi River at the highest pointand very much cut up by the washing rains; the ravines were grown upwith cane and underbrush, while the sides and tops were covered with adense forest.  Farther south the ground flattens out somewhat, and wasin cultivation.  But here, too, it was cut up by ravines and smallstreams.  The enemy's line of defence followed the crest of a ridge fromthe river north of the city eastward, then southerly around to theJackson road, full three miles back of the city; thence in asouthwesterly direction to the river.  Deep ravines of the descriptiongiven lay in front of these defences.  As there is a succession ofgullies, cut out by rains along the side of the ridge, the line wasnecessarily very irregular.  To follow each of these spurs withintrenchments, so as to command the slopes on either side, would havelengthened their line very much. Generally therefore, or in many places,their line would run from near the head of one gully nearly straight tothe head of another, and an outer work triangular in shape, generallyopen in the rear, was thrown up on the point; with a few men in thisouter work they commanded the approaches to the main line completely.The work to be done, to make our position as strong against the enemy ashis was against us, was very great.  The problem was also complicated byour wanting our line as near that of the enemy as possible.  We had butfour engineer officers with us. Captain Prime, of the Engineer Corps,was the chief, and the work at the beginning was mainly directed by him.His health soon gave out, when he was succeeded by Captain Comstock,also of the Engineer Corps.  To provide assistants on such a long line Idirected that all officers who had graduated at West Point, where theyhad necessarily to study military engineering, should in addition totheir other duties assist in the work.The chief quartermaster and the chief commissary were graduates.  Thechief commissary, now the Commissary-General of the Army, begged off,however, saying that there was nothing in engineering that he was goodfor unless he would do for a sap-roller.  As soldiers require rationswhile working in the ditches as well as when marching and fighting, andas we would be sure to lose him if he was used as a sap-roller, I lethim off.  The general is a large man; weighs two hundred and twentypounds, and is not tall.We had no siege guns except six thirty-two pounders, and there were noneat the West to draw from.  Admiral Porter, however, supplied us with abattery of navy-guns of large calibre, and with these, and the fieldartillery used in the campaign, the siege began.  The first thing to dowas to get the artillery in batteries where they would occupy commandingpositions; then establish the camps, under cover from the fire of theenemy but as near up as possible; and then construct rifle-pits andcovered ways, to connect the entire command by the shortest route.  Theenemy did not harass us much while we were constructing our batteries.Probably their artillery ammunition was short; and their infantry waskept down by our sharpshooters, who were always on the alert and readyto fire at a head whenever it showed itself above the rebel works.In no place were our lines more than six hundred yards from the enemy.It was necessary, therefore, to cover our men by something more thanthe ordinary parapet.  To give additional protection sand bags,bullet-proof, were placed along the tops of the parapets far enoughapart to make loop-holes for musketry.  On top of these, logs were put.By these means the men were enabled to walk about erect when off duty,without fear of annoyance from sharpshooters.  The enemy used in theirdefence explosive musket-balls, no doubt thinking that, bursting overour men in the trenches, they would do some execution; but I do notremember a single case where a man was injured by a piece of one ofthese shells. When they were hit and the ball exploded, the wound wasterrible.  In these cases a solid ball would have hit as well.  Theiruse is barbarous, because they produce increased suffering without anycorresponding advantage to those using them.The enemy could not resort to our method to protect their men, becausewe had an inexhaustible supply of ammunition to draw upon and used itfreely.  Splinters from the timber would have made havoc among the menbehind.There were no mortars with the besiegers, except what the navy had infront of the city; but wooden ones were made by taking logs of thetoughest wood that could be found, boring them out for six or twelvepound shells and binding them with strong iron bands.  These answered ascochorns, and shells were successfully thrown from them into thetrenches of the enemy.The labor of building the batteries and intrenching was largely done bythe pioneers, assisted by negroes who came within our lines and who werepaid for their work; but details from the troops had often to be made.The work was pushed forward as rapidly as possible, and when an advancedposition was secured and covered from the fire of the enemy thebatteries were advanced.  By the 30th of June there were two hundred andtwenty guns in position, mostly light field-pieces, besides a battery ofheavy guns belonging to, manned and commanded by the navy.  We were nowas strong for defence against the garrison of Vicksburg as they wereagainst us; but I knew that Johnston was in our rear, and was receivingconstant reinforcements from the east. He had at this time a largerforce than I had had at any time prior to the battle of Champion's Hill.As soon as the news of the arrival of the Union army behind Vicksburgreached the North, floods of visitors began to pour in.  Some came togratify curiosity; some to see sons or brothers who had passed throughthe terrible ordeal; members of the Christian and Sanitary Associationscame to minister to the wants of the sick and the wounded.  Often thosecoming to see a son or brother would bring a dozen or two of poultry.They did not know how little the gift would be appreciated.  Many of thesoldiers had lived so much on chickens, ducks and turkeys without breadduring the march, that the sight of poultry, if they could get bacon,almost took away their appetite.  But the intention was good.Among the earliest arrivals was the Governor of Illinois, with most ofthe State officers.  I naturally wanted to show them what there was ofmost interest.  In Sherman's front the ground was the most broken andmost wooded, and more was to be seen without exposure.  I therefore tookthem to Sherman's headquarters and presented them.  Before starting outto look at the lines--possibly while Sherman's horse was being saddled--there were many questions asked about the late campaign, about whichthe North had been so imperfectly informed.  There was a little knotaround Sherman and another around me, and I heard Sherman repeating, inthe most animated manner, what he had said to me when we first lookeddown from Walnut Hills upon the land below on the 18th of May, adding:'Grant is entitled to every bit of the credit for the campaign; Iopposed it. I wrote him a letter about it.'  But for this speech it isnot likely that Sherman's opposition would have ever been heard of.  Hisuntiring energy and great efficiency during the campaign entitle him toa full share of all the credit due for its success.  He could not havedone more if the plan had been his own. (*13)On the 26th of May I sent Blair's division up the Yazoo to drive out aforce of the enemy supposed to be between the Big Black and the Yazoo.The country was rich and full of supplies of both food and forage.Blair was instructed to take all of it.  The cattle were to be driven infor the use of our army, and the food and forage to be consumed by ourtroops or destroyed by fire; all bridges were to be destroyed, and theroads rendered as nearly impassable as possible.  Blair went forty-fivemiles and was gone almost a week.  His work was effectually done.  Irequested Porter at this time to send the marine brigade, a floatingnondescript force which had been assigned to his command and whichproved very useful, up to Haines' Bluff to hold it until reinforcementscould be sent.On the 26th I also received a letter from Banks, asking me to reinforcehim with ten thousand men at Port Hudson.  Of course I could not complywith his request, nor did I think he needed them.  He was in no dangerof an attack by the garrison in his front, and there was no armyorganizing in his rear to raise the siege.On the 3d of June a brigade from Hurlbut's command arrived, GeneralKimball commanding.  It was sent to Mechanicsburg, some miles north-eastof Haines' Bluff and about midway between the Big Black and the Yazoo.A brigade of Blair's division and twelve hundred cavalry had already, onBlair's return from the Yazoo, been sent to the same place withinstructions to watch the crossings of the Big Black River, to destroythe roads in his (Blair's) front, and to gather or destroy all supplies.On the 7th of June our little force of colored and white troops acrossthe Mississippi, at Milliken's Bend, were attacked by about 3,000 menfrom Richard Taylor's trans-Mississippi command.  With the aid of thegunboats they were speedily repelled.  I sent Mower's brigade over withinstructions to drive the enemy beyond the Tensas Bayou; and we had nofurther trouble in that quarter during the siege.  This was the firstimportant engagement of the war in which colored troops were under fire.These men were very raw, having all been enlisted since the beginning ofthe siege, but they behaved well.On the 8th of June a full division arrived from Hurlbut's command, underGeneral Sooy Smith.  It was sent immediately to Haines' Bluff, andGeneral C. C. Washburn was assigned to the general command at thatpoint.On the 11th a strong division arrived from the Department of theMissouri under General Herron, which was placed on our left. This cutoff the last possible chance of communication between Pemberton andJohnston, as it enabled Lauman to close up on McClernand's left whileHerron intrenched from Lauman to the water's edge.  At this point thewater recedes a few hundred yards from the high land.  Through thisopening no doubt the Confederate commanders had been able to getmessengers under cover of night.On the 14th General Parke arrived with two divisions of Burnside'scorps, and was immediately dispatched to Haines' Bluff.  These lattertroops--Herron's and Parke's--were the reinforcements already spoken ofsent by Halleck in anticipation of their being needed.  They arrivednone too soon.I now had about seventy-one thousand men.  More than half were disposedacross the peninsula, between the Yazoo at Haines' Bluff and the BigBlack, with the division of Osterhaus watching the crossings of thelatter river farther south and west from the crossing of the Jacksonroad to Baldwin's ferry and below.There were eight roads leading into Vicksburg, along which and theirimmediate sides, our work was specially pushed and batteries advanced;but no commanding point within range of the enemy was neglected.On the 17th I received a letter from General Sherman and one on the 18thfrom General McPherson, saying that their respective commands hadcomplained to them of a fulsome, congratulatory order published byGeneral McClernand to the 13th corps, which did great injustice to theother troops engaged in the campaign.  This order had been sent Northand published, and now papers containing it had reached our camps.  Theorder had not been heard of by me, and certainly not by troops outsideof McClernand's command until brought in this way.  I at once wrote toMcClernand, directing him to send me a copy of this order.  He did so,and I at once relieved him from the command of the 13th army corps andordered him back to Springfield, Illinois.  The publication of his orderin the press was in violation of War Department orders and also of mine.
ISFP	 XXXVIII.JOHNSTON'S MOVEMENTS--FORTIFICATIONS AT HAINES' BLUFF--EXPLOSION OF THEMINE--EXPLOSION OF THE SECOND MINE--PREPARING FOR THE ASSAULT--THE FLAGOF TRUCE--MEETING WITH PEMBERTON--NEGOTIATIONS FOR SURRENDER--ACCEPTINGTHE TERMS--SURRENDER OF VICKSBURG.On the 22d of June positive information was received that Johnston hadcrossed the Big Black River for the purpose of attacking our rear, toraise the siege and release Pemberton. The correspondence betweenJohnston and Pemberton shows that all expectation of holding Vicksburghad by this time passed from Johnston's mind.  I immediately orderedSherman to the command of all the forces from Haines' Bluff to the BigBlack River. This amounted now to quite half the troops about Vicksburg.Besides these, Herron and A. J. Smith's divisions were ordered to holdthemselves in readiness to reinforce Sherman.  Haines' Bluff had beenstrongly fortified on the land side, and on all commanding points fromthere to the Big Black at the railroad crossing batteries had beenconstructed.  The work of connecting by rifle-pits where this was notalready done, was an easy task for the troops that were to defend them.We were now looking west, besieging Pemberton, while we were alsolooking east to defend ourselves against an expected siege by Johnston.But as against the garrison of Vicksburg we were as substantiallyprotected as they were against us.  Where we were looking east and northwe were strongly fortified, and on the defensive.  Johnston evidentlytook in the situation and wisely, I think, abstained from making anassault on us because it would simply have inflicted loss on both sideswithout accomplishing any result.  We were strong enough to have takenthe offensive against him; but I did not feel disposed to take any riskof losing our hold upon Pemberton's army, while I would have rejoiced atthe opportunity of defending ourselves against an attack by Johnston.From the 23d of May the work of fortifying and pushing forward ourposition nearer to the enemy had been steadily progressing.  At threepoints on the Jackson road, in front of Leggett's brigade, a sap was runup to the enemy's parapet, and by the 25th of June we had it underminedand the mine charged. The enemy had countermined, but did not succeed inreaching our mine.  At this particular point the hill on which the rebelwork stands rises abruptly.  Our sap ran close up to the outside of theenemy's parapet.  In fact this parapet was also our protection.  Thesoldiers of the two sides occasionally conversed pleasantly across thisbarrier; sometimes they exchanged the hard bread of the Union soldiersfor the tobacco of the Confederates; at other times the enemy threw overhand-grenades, and often our men, catching them in their hands, returnedthem.Our mine had been started some distance back down the hill; consequentlywhen it had extended as far as the parapet it was many feet below it.This caused the failure of the enemy in his search to find and destroyit.  On the 25th of June at three o'clock, all being ready, the mine wasexploded.  A heavy artillery fire all along the line had been ordered toopen with the explosion.  The effect was to blow the top of the hill offand make a crater where it stood.  The breach was not sufficient toenable us to pass a column of attack through.  In fact, the enemy havingfailed to reach our mine had thrown up a line farther back, where mostof the men guarding that point were placed.  There were a few men,however, left at the advance line, and others working in thecountermine, which was still being pushed to find ours.  All that werethere were thrown into the air, some of them coming down on our side,still alive.  I remember one colored man, who had been under ground atwork when the explosion took place, who was thrown to our side.  He wasnot much hurt, but terribly frightened.  Some one asked him how high hehad gone up.  'Dun no, massa, but t'ink 'bout t'ree mile,' was hisreply.  General Logan commanded at this point and took this colored manto his quarters, where he did service to the end of the siege.As soon as the explosion took place the crater was seized by tworegiments of our troops who were near by, under cover, where they hadbeen placed for the express purpose.  The enemy made a desperate effortto expel them, but failed, and soon retired behind the new line.  Fromhere, however, they threw hand-grenades, which did some execution.  Thecompliment was returned by our men, but not with so much effect.  Theenemy could lay their grenades on the parapet, which alone divided thecontestants, and roll them down upon us; while from our side they had tobe thrown over the parapet, which was at considerable elevation.  Duringthe night we made efforts to secure our position in the crater againstthe missiles of the enemy, so as to run trenches along the outer base oftheir parapet, right and left; but the enemy continued throwing theirgrenades, and brought boxes of field ammunition (shells), the fuses ofwhich they would light with portfires, and throw them by hand into ourranks.  We found it impossible to continue this work.  Another mine wasconsequently started which was exploded on the 1st of July, destroyingan entire rebel redan, killing and wounding a considerable number of itsoccupants and leaving an immense chasm where it stood.  No attempt tocharge was made this time, the experience of the 25th admonishing us.Our loss in the first affair was about thirty killed and wounded.  Theenemy must have lost more in the two explosions than we did in thefirst.  We lost none in the second.From this time forward the work of mining and pushing our positionnearer to the enemy was prosecuted with vigor, and I determined toexplode no more mines until we were ready to explode a number atdifferent points and assault immediately after.  We were up now at threedifferent points, one in front of each corps, to where only the parapetof the enemy divided us.At this time an intercepted dispatch from Johnston to Pemberton informedme that Johnston intended to make a determined attack upon us in orderto relieve the garrison at Vicksburg.  I knew the garrison would make noformidable effort to relieve itself.  The picket lines were so close toeach other--where there was space enough between the lines to postpickets--that the men could converse.  On the 21st of June I wasinformed, through this means, that Pemberton was preparing to escape, bycrossing to the Louisiana side under cover of night; that he hademployed workmen in making boats for that purpose; that the men had beencanvassed to ascertain if they would make an assault on the 'Yankees' tocut their way out; that they had refused, and almost mutinied, becausetheir commander would not surrender and relieve their sufferings, andhad only been pacified by the assurance that boats enough would befinished in a week to carry them all over.  The rebel pickets also saidthat houses in the city had been pulled down to get material to buildthese boats with.  Afterwards this story was verified:  on entering thecity we found a large number of very rudely constructed boats.All necessary steps were at once taken to render such an attemptabortive.  Our pickets were doubled; Admiral Porter was notified, sothat the river might be more closely watched; material was collected onthe west bank of the river to be set on fire and light up the river ifthe attempt was made; and batteries were established along the leveecrossing the peninsula on the Louisiana side.  Had the attempt been madethe garrison of Vicksburg would have been drowned, or made prisoners onthe Louisiana side.  General Richard Taylor was expected on the westbank to co-operate in this movement, I believe, but he did not come, norcould he have done so with a force sufficient to be of service.  TheMississippi was now in our possession from its source to its mouth,except in the immediate front of Vicksburg and of Port Hudson.  We hadnearly exhausted the country, along a line drawn from Lake Providence toopposite Bruinsburg.  The roads west were not of a character to drawsupplies over for any considerable force.By the 1st of July our approaches had reached the enemy's ditch at anumber of places.  At ten points we could move under cover to withinfrom five to one hundred yards of the enemy.  Orders were given to makeall preparations for assault on the 6th of July.  The debouches wereordered widened to afford easy egress, while the approaches were also tobe widened to admit the troops to pass through four abreast.  Plank, andbags filled with cotton packed in tightly, were ordered prepared, toenable the troops to cross the ditches.On the night of the 1st of July Johnston was between Brownsville and theBig Black, and wrote Pemberton from there that about the 7th of themonth an attempt would be made to create a diversion to enable him tocut his way out.  Pemberton was a prisoner before this message reachedhim.On July 1st Pemberton, seeing no hope of outside relief, addressed thefollowing letter to each of his four division commanders:'Unless the siege of Vicksburg is raised, or supplies are thrown in, itwill become necessary very shortly to evacuate the place.  I see noprospect of the former, and there are many great, if not insuperableobstacles in the way of the latter. You are, therefore, requested toinform me with as little delay as possible, as to the condition of yourtroops and their ability to make the marches and undergo the fatiguesnecessary to accomplish a successful evacuation.'Two of his generals suggested surrender, and the other two practicallydid the same.  They expressed the opinion that an attempt to evacuatewould fail.  Pemberton had previously got a message to Johnstonsuggesting that he should try to negotiate with me for a release of thegarrison with their arms.  Johnston replied that it would be aconfession of weakness for him to do so; but he authorized Pemberton touse his name in making such an arrangement.On the 3d about ten o'clock A.M. white flags appeared on a portion ofthe rebel works.  Hostilities along that part of the line ceased atonce.  Soon two persons were seen coming towards our lines bearing awhite flag.  They proved to be General Bowen, a division commander, andColonel Montgomery, aide-de-camp to Pemberton, bearing the followingletter to me:'I have the honor to propose an armistice for--hours, with the view toarranging terms for the capitulation of Vicksburg.  To this end, ifagreeable to you, I will appoint three commissioners, to meet a likenumber to be named by yourself at such place and hour to-day as you mayfind convenient.  I make this proposition to save the further effusionof blood, which must otherwise be shed to a frightful extent, feelingmyself fully able to maintain my position for a yet indefinite period.This communication will be handed you under a flag of truce, byMajor-General John S. Bowen.'It was a glorious sight to officers and soldiers on the line where thesewhite flags were visible, and the news soon spread to all parts of thecommand.  The troops felt that their long and weary marches, hardfighting, ceaseless watching by night and day, in a hot climate,exposure to all sorts of weather, to diseases and, worst of all, to thegibes of many Northern papers that came to them saying all theirsuffering was in vain, that Vicksburg would never be taken, were at lastat an end and the Union sure to be saved.Bowen was received by General A. J. Smith, and asked to see me.  I hadbeen a neighbor of Bowen's in Missouri, and knew him well and favorablybefore the war; but his request was refused.  He then suggested that Ishould meet Pemberton.  To this I sent a verbal message saying that, ifPemberton desired it, I would meet him in front of McPherson's corps atthree o'clock that afternoon.  I also sent the following written replyto Pemberton's letter:'Your note of this date is just received, proposing an armistice forseveral hours, for the purpose of arranging terms of capitulationthrough commissioners, to be appointed, etc.  The useless effusion ofblood you propose stopping by this course can be ended at any time youmay choose, by the unconditional surrender of the city and garrison.Men who have shown so much endurance and courage as those now inVicksburg, will always challenge the respect of an adversary, and I canassure you will be treated with all the respect due to prisoners of war.I do not favor the proposition of appointing commissioners to arrangethe terms of capitulation, because I have no terms other than thoseindicated above.'At three o'clock Pemberton appeared at the point suggested in my verbalmessage, accompanied by the same officers who had borne his letter ofthe morning.  Generals Ord, McPherson, Logan and A. J. Smith, andseveral officers of my staff, accompanied me. Our place of meeting wason a hillside within a few hundred feet of the rebel lines.  Near bystood a stunted oak-tree, which was made historical by the event.  Itwas but a short time before the last vestige of its body, root and limbhad disappeared, the fragments taken as trophies.  Since then the sametree has furnished as many cords of wood, in the shape of trophies, as'The True Cross.'Pemberton and I had served in the same division during part of theMexican War.  I knew him very well therefore, and greeted him as an oldacquaintance.  He soon asked what terms I proposed to give his army ifit surrendered.  My answer was the same as proposed in my reply to hisletter.  Pemberton then said, rather snappishly, 'The conference mightas well end,' and turned abruptly as if to leave.  I said, 'Very well.'General Bowen, I saw, was very anxious that the surrender should beconsummated. His manner and remarks while Pemberton and I were talking,showed this.  He now proposed that he and one of our generals shouldhave a conference.  I had no objection to this, as nothing could be madebinding upon me that they might propose. Smith and Bowen accordingly hada conference, during which Pemberton and I, moving a short distance awaytowards the enemy's lines were in conversation.  After a while Bowensuggested that the Confederate army should be allowed to march out withthe honors of war, carrying their small arms and field artillery.  Thiswas promptly and unceremoniously rejected.  The interview here ended, Iagreeing, however, to send a letter giving final terms by ten o'clockthat night.Word was sent to Admiral Porter soon after the correspondence withPemberton commenced, so that hostilities might be stopped on the part ofboth army and navy.  It was agreed on my paging with Pemberton that theyshould not be renewed until our correspondence ceased.When I returned to my headquarters I sent for all the corps and divisioncommanders with the army immediately confronting Vicksburg.  Half thearmy was from eight to twelve miles off, waiting for Johnston.  Iinformed them of the contents of Pemberton's letters, of my reply andthe substance of the interview, and that I was ready to hear anysuggestion; but would hold the power of deciding entirely in my ownhands.  This was the nearest approach to a 'council of war' I ever held.Against the general, and almost unanimous judgment of the council I sentthe following letter:'In conformity with agreement of this afternoon, I will submit thefollowing proposition for the surrender of the City of Vicksburg, publicstores, etc.  On your accepting the terms proposed, I will march in onedivision as a guard, and take possession at eight A.M. to-morrow.  Assoon as rolls can be made out, and paroles be signed by officers andmen, you will be allowed to march out of our lines, the officers takingwith them their side-arms and clothing, and the field, staff and cavalryofficers one horse each.  The rank and file will be allowed all theirclothing, but no other property.  If these conditions are accepted, anyamount of rations you may deem necessary can be taken from the storesyou now have, and also the necessary cooking utensils for preparingthem.  Thirty wagons also, counting two two-horse or mule teams as one,will be allowed to transport such articles as cannot be carried along.The same conditions will be allowed to all sick and wounded officers andsoldiers as fast as they become able to travel.  The paroles for theselatter must be signed, however, whilst officers present are authorizedto sign the roll of prisoners.'By the terms of the cartel then in force, prisoners captured by eitherarmy were required to be forwarded as soon as possible to either Aiken'slanding below Dutch Gap on the James River, or to Vicksburg, there to beexchanged, or paroled until they could be exchanged.  There was aConfederate commissioner at Vicksburg, authorized to make the exchange.I did not propose to take him a prisoner, but to leave him free toperform the functions of his office.  Had I insisted upon anunconditional surrender there would have been over thirty thousand mento transport to Cairo, very much to the inconvenience of the army on theMississippi.  Thence the prisoners would have had to be transported byrail to Washington or Baltimore; thence again by steamer to Aiken's--allat very great expense.  At Aiken's they would have had to be paroled,because the Confederates did not have Union prisoners to give inexchange.  Then again Pemberton's army was largely composed of men whosehomes were in the South-west; I knew many of them were tired of the warand would get home just as soon as they could.  A large number of themhad voluntarily come into our lines during the siege, and requested tobe sent north where they could get employment until the war was over andthey could go to their homes.Late at night I received the following reply to my last letter:'I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your communication ofthis date, proposing terms of capitulation for this garrison and post.In the main your terms are accepted; but, in justice both to the honorand spirit of my troops manifested in the defence of Vicksburg, I haveto submit the following amendments, which, if acceded to by you, willperfect the agreement between us.  At ten o'clock A.M. to-morrow, Ipropose to evacuate the works in and around Vicksburg, and to surrenderthe city and garrison under my command, by marching out with my colorsand arms, stacking them in front of my present lines.  After which youwill take possession.  Officers to retain their side-arms and personalproperty, and the rights and property of citizens to be respected.'This was received after midnight.  My reply was as follows:'I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your communication of 3dJuly.  The amendment proposed by you cannot be acceded to in full.  Itwill be necessary to furnish every officer and man with a parole signedby himself, which, with the completion of the roll of prisoners, willnecessarily take some time.  Again, I can make no stipulations withregard to the treatment of citizens and their private property.  While Ido not propose to cause them any undue annoyance or loss, I cannotconsent to leave myself under any restraint by stipulations. Theproperty which officers will be allowed to take with them will be asstated in my proposition of last evening; that is, officers will beallowed their private baggage and side-arms, and mounted officers onehorse each.  If you mean by your proposition for each brigade to marchto the front of the lines now occupied by it, and stack arms at teno'clock A.M., and then return to the inside and there remain asprisoners until properly paroled, I will make no objection to it.Should no notification be received of your acceptance of my terms bynine o'clock A.M. I shall regard them as having been rejected, and shallact accordingly.  Should these terms be accepted, white flags should bedisplayed along your lines to prevent such of my troops as may not havebeen notified, from firing upon your men.'Pemberton promptly accepted these terms.During the siege there had been a good deal of friendly sparring betweenthe soldiers of the two armies, on picket and where the lines were closetogether.  All rebels were known as 'Johnnies,' all Union troops as'Yanks.'  Often 'Johnny' would call:  'Well, Yank, when are you cominginto town?'  The reply was sometimes: 'We propose to celebrate the 4thof July there.'  Sometimes it would be:  'We always treat our prisonerswith kindness and do not want to hurt them;' or, 'We are holding you asprisoners of war while you are feeding yourselves.'  The garrison, fromthe commanding general down, undoubtedly expected an assault on thefourth.  They knew from the temper of their men it would be successfulwhen made; and that would be a greater humiliation than to surrender.Besides it would be attended with severe loss to them.The Vicksburg paper, which we received regularly through the courtesy ofthe rebel pickets, said prior to the fourth, in speaking of the 'Yankee'boast that they would take dinner in Vicksburg that day, that the bestreceipt for cooking a rabbit was 'First ketch your rabbit.'  The paperat this time and for some time previous was printed on the plain side ofwall paper.  The last number was issued on the fourth and announced thatwe had 'caught our rabbit.'I have no doubt that Pemberton commenced his correspondence on the thirdwith a two-fold purpose:  first, to avoid an assault, which he knewwould be successful, and second, to prevent the capture taking place onthe great national holiday, the anniversary of the Declaration ofAmerican Independence. Holding out for better terms as he did hedefeated his aim in the latter particular.At the appointed hour the garrison of Vicksburg marched out of theirworks and formed line in front, stacked arms and marched back in goodorder.  Our whole army present witnessed this scene without cheering.Logan's division, which had approached nearest the rebel works, was thefirst to march in; and the flag of one of the regiments of his divisionwas soon floating over the court-house.  Our soldiers were no soonerinside the lines than the two armies began to fraternize.  Our men hadhad full rations from the time the siege commenced, to the close.  Theenemy had been suffering, particularly towards the last.  I myself sawour men taking bread from their haversacks and giving it to the enemythey had so recently been engaged in starving out.  It was accepted withavidity and with thanks.Pemberton says in his report:'If it should be asked why the 4th of July was selected as the day forsurrender, the answer is obvious.  I believed that upon that day Ishould obtain better terms.  Well aware of the vanity of our foe, I knewthey would attach vast importance to the entrance on the 4th of Julyinto the stronghold of the great river, and that, to gratify theirnational vanity, they would yield then what could not be extorted fromthem at any other time.'This does not support my view of his reasons for selecting the day hedid for surrendering.  But it must be recollected that his first letterasking terms was received about 10 o'clock A.M., July 3d.  It then couldhardly be expected that it would take twenty-four hours to effect asurrender.  He knew that Johnston was in our rear for the purpose ofraising the siege, and he naturally would want to hold out as long as hecould.  He knew his men would not resist an assault, and one wasexpected on the fourth.  In our interview he told me he had rationsenough to hold out for some time--my recollection is two weeks.  It wasthis statement that induced me to insert in the terms that he was todraw rations for his men from his own supplies.On the 4th of July General Holmes, with an army of eight or ninethousand men belonging to the trans-Mississippi department, made anattack upon Helena, Arkansas.  He was totally defeated by GeneralPrentiss, who was holding Helena with less than forty-two hundredsoldiers.  Holmes reported his loss at 1,636, of which 173 were killed;but as Prentiss buried 400, Holmes evidently understated his losses.The Union loss was 57 killed, 127 wounded, and between 30 and 40missing.  This was the last effort on the part of the Confederacy toraise the siege of Vicksburg.On the third, as soon as negotiations were commenced, I notified Shermanand directed him to be ready to take the offensive against Johnston,drive him out of the State and destroy his army if he could.  Steele andOrd were directed at the same time to be in readiness to join Sherman assoon as the surrender took place.  Of this Sherman was notified.I rode into Vicksburg with the troops, and went to the river to exchangecongratulations with the navy upon our joint victory. At that time Ifound that many of the citizens had been living under ground.  Theridges upon which Vicksburg is built, and those back to the Big Black,are composed of a deep yellow clay of great tenacity.  Where roads andstreets are cut through, perpendicular banks are left and stand as wellas if composed of stone.  The magazines of the enemy were made byrunning passage-ways into this clay at places where there were deepcuts.  Many citizens secured places of safety for their families bycarving out rooms in these embankments.  A door-way in these cases wouldbe cut in a high bank, starting from the level of the road or street,and after running in a few feet a room of the size required was carvedout of the clay, the dirt being removed by the door-way.  In someinstances I saw where two rooms were cut out, for a single family, witha door-way in the clay wall separating them.  Some of these werecarpeted and furnished with considerable elaboration.  In these theoccupants were fully secure from the shells of the navy, which weredropped into the city night and dav without intermission.I returned to my old headquarters outside in the afternoon, and did notmove into the town until the sixth.  On the afternoon of the fourth Isent Captain Wm. M. Dunn of my staff to Cairo, the nearest point wherethe telegraph could be reached, with a dispatch to the general-in-chief.It was as follows:'The enemy surrendered this morning.  The only terms allowed is theirparole as prisoners of war.  This I regard as a great advantage to us atthis moment.  It saves, probably, several days in the capture, andleaves troops and transports ready for immediate service.  Sherman, witha large force, moves immediately on Johnston, to drive him from theState.  I will send troops to the relief of Banks, and return the 9tharmy corps to Burnside.'This news, with the victory at Gettysburg won the same day, lifted agreat load of anxiety from the minds of the President, his Cabinet andthe loyal people all over the North.  The fate of the Confederacy wassealed when Vicksburg fell.  Much hard fighting was to be doneafterwards and many precious lives were to be sacrificed; but the MORALEwas with the supporters of the Union ever after.I at the same time wrote to General Banks informing him of the fall andsending him a copy of the terms; also saying I would send him all thetroops he wanted to insure the capture of the only foothold the enemynow had on the Mississippi River. General Banks had a number of copiesof this letter printed, or at least a synopsis of it, and very soon acopy fell into the hands of General Gardner, who was then in command ofPort Hudson.  Gardner at once sent a letter to the commander of theNational forces saying that he had been informed of the surrender ofVicksburg and telling how the information reached him.  He added that ifthis was true, it was useless for him to hold out longer.  General Banksgave him assurances that Vicksburg had been surrendered, and GeneralGardner surrendered unconditionally on the 9th of July.  Port Hudsonwith nearly 6,000 prisoners, 51 guns, 5,000 small-arms and other storesfell into the hands of the Union forces:  from that day to the close ofthe rebellion the Mississippi River, from its source to its mouth,remained in the control of the National troops.Pemberton and his army were kept in Vicksburg until the whole could beparoled.  The paroles were in duplicate, by organization (one copy foreach, Federals and Confederates), and signed by the commanding officersof the companies or regiments.  Duplicates were also made for eachsoldier and signed by each individually, one to be retained by thesoldier signing and one to be retained by us.  Several hundred refusedto sign their paroles, preferring to be sent to the North as prisonersto being sent back to fight again.  Others again kept out of the way,hoping to escape either alternative.Pemberton appealed to me in person to compel these men to sign theirparoles, but I declined.  It also leaked out that many of the men whohad signed their paroles, intended to desert and go to their homes assoon as they got out of our lines.  Pemberton hearing this, againappealed to me to assist him.  He wanted arms for a battalion, to act asguards in keeping his men together while being marched to a camp ofinstruction, where he expected to keep them until exchanged.  Thisrequest was also declined.  It was precisely what I expected and hopedthat they would do.  I told him, however, that I would see that theymarched beyond our lines in good order.  By the eleventh, just one weekafter the surrender, the paroles were completed and the Confederategarrison marched out.  Many deserted, and fewer of them were everreturned to the ranks to fight again than would have been the case hadthe surrender been unconditional and the prisoners sent to the JamesRiver to be paroled.As soon as our troops took possession of the city guards wereestablished along the whole line of parapet, from the river above to theriver below.  The prisoners were allowed to occupy their old campsbehind the intrenchments.  No restraint was put upon them, except bytheir own commanders.  They were rationed about as our own men, and fromour supplies.  The men of the two armies fraternized as if they had beenfighting for the same cause.  When they passed out of the works they hadso long and so gallantly defended, between lines of their lateantagonists, not a cheer went up, not a remark was made that would givepain.  Really, I believe there was a feeling of sadness just then in thebreasts of most of the Union soldiers at seeing the dejection of theirlate antagonists.The day before the departure the following order was issued:'Paroled prisoners will be sent out of here to-morrow.  They will beauthorized to cross at the railroad bridge, and move from there toEdward's Ferry, (*14) and on by way of Raymond. Instruct the commands tobe orderly and quiet as these prisoners pass, to make no offensiveremarks, and not to harbor any who fall out of ranks after they havepassed.'
ISFP	 XXXIX.RETROSPECT OF THE CAMPAIGN--SHERMAN'S MOVEMENTS--PROPOSED MOVEMENT UPONMOBILE--A PAINFUL ACCIDENT--ORDERED TO REPORT AT CAIRO.The capture of Vicksburg, with its garrison, ordnance and ordnancestores, and the successful battles fought in reaching them, gave newspirit to the loyal people of the North.  New hopes for the finalsuccess of the cause of the Union were inspired.  The victory gained atGettysburg, upon the same day, added to their hopes.  Now theMississippi River was entirely in the possession of the National troops;for the fall of Vicksburg gave us Port Hudson at once.  The army ofnorthern Virginia was driven out of Pennsylvania and forced back toabout the same ground it occupied in 1861.  The Army of the Tennesseeunited with the Army of the Gulf, dividing the Confederate Statescompletely.The first dispatch I received from the government after the fall ofVicksburg was in these words:'I fear your paroling the prisoners at Vicksburg, without actualdelivery to a proper agent as required by the seventh article of thecartel, may be construed into an absolute release, and that the men willimmediately be placed in the ranks of the enemy. Such has been the caseelsewhere.  If these prisoners have not been allowed to depart, you willdetain them until further orders.'Halleck did not know that they had already been delivered into the handsof Major Watts, Confederate commissioner for the exchange of prisoners.At Vicksburg 31,600 prisoners were surrendered, together with 172 cannonabout 60,000 muskets and a large amount of ammunition.  The small-armsof the enemy were far superior to the bulk of ours.  Up to this time ourtroops at the West had been limited to the old United States flint-lockmuskets changed into percussion, or the Belgian musket imported early inthe war--almost as dangerous to the person firing it as to the one aimedat--and a few new and improved arms.  These were of many differentcalibers, a fact that caused much trouble in distributing ammunitionduring an engagement.  The enemy had generally new arms which had runthe blockade and were of uniform caliber.  After the surrender Iauthorized all colonels whose regiments were armed with inferiormuskets, to place them in the stack of captured arms and replace themwith the latter.  A large number of arms turned in to the OrdnanceDepartment as captured, were thus arms that had really been used by theUnion army in the capture of Vicksburg.In this narrative I have not made the mention I should like of officers,dead and alive, whose services entitle them to special mention.  Neitherhave I made that mention of the navy which its services deserve.Suffice it to say, the close of the siege of Vicksburg found us with anarmy unsurpassed, in proportion to its numbers, taken as a whole ofofficers and men.  A military education was acquired which no otherschool could have given. Men who thought a company was quite enough forthem to command properly at the beginning, would have made goodregimental or brigade commanders; most of the brigade commanders wereequal to the command of a division, and one, Ransom, would have beenequal to the command of a corps at least. Logan and Crocker ended thecampaign fitted to command independent armies.General F. P. Blair joined me at Milliken's Bend a full-fledged general,without having served in a lower grade.  He commanded a division in thecampaign.  I had known Blair in Missouri, where I had voted against himin 1858 when he ran for Congress.  I knew him as a frank, positive andgenerous man, true to his friends even to a fault, but always a leader.I dreaded his coming; I knew from experience that it was more difficultto command two generals desiring to be leaders than it was to commandone army officered intelligently and with subordination.  It affords methe greatest pleasure to record now my agreeable disappointment inrespect to his character.  There was no man braver than he, nor wasthere any who obeyed all orders of his superior in rank with moreunquestioning alacrity.  He was one man as a soldier, another as apolitician.The navy under Porter was all it could be, during the entire campaign.Without its assistance the campaign could not have been successfullymade with twice the number of men engaged.  It could not have been madeat all, in the way it was, with any number of men without suchassistance.  The most perfect harmony reigned between the two arms ofthe service.  There never was a request made, that I am aware of, eitherof the flag-officer or any of his subordinates, that was not promptlycomplied with.The campaign of Vicksburg was suggested and developed by circumstances.The elections of 1862 had gone against the prosecution of the war.Voluntary enlistments had nearly ceased and the draft had been resortedto; this was resisted, and a defeat or backward movement would have madeits execution impossible.  A forward movement to a decisive victory wasnecessary.  Accordingly I resolved to get below Vicksburg, unite withBanks against Port Hudson, make New Orleans a base and, with that baseand Grand Gulf as a starting point, move our combined forces againstVicksburg.  Upon reaching Grand Gulf, after running its batteries andfighting a battle, I received a letter from Banks informing me that hecould not be at Port Hudson under ten days, and then with only fifteenthousand men.  The time was worth more than the reinforcements; Itherefore determined to push into the interior of the enemy's country.With a large river behind us, held above and below by the enemy, rapidmovements were essential to success.  Jackson was captured the day aftera new commander had arrived, and only a few days before largereinforcements were expected.  A rapid movement west was made; thegarrison of Vicksburg was met in two engagements and badly defeated, anddriven back into its stronghold and there successfully besieged.  Itlooks now as though Providence had directed the course of the campaignwhile the Army of the Tennessee executed the decree.Upon the surrender of the garrison of Vicksburg there were three thingsthat required immediate attention.  The first was to send a force todrive the enemy from our rear, and out of the State.  The second was tosend reinforcements to Banks near Port Hudson, if necessary, to completethe triumph of opening the Mississippi from its source to its mouth tothe free navigation of vessels bearing the Stars and Stripes.  The thirdwas to inform the authorities at Washington and the North of the goodnews, to relieve their long suspense and strengthen their confidence inthe ultimate success of the cause they had so much at heart.Soon after negotiations were opened with General Pemberton for thesurrender of the city, I notified Sherman, whose troops extended fromHaines' Bluff on the left to the crossing of the Vicksburg and Jacksonroad over the Big Black on the right, and directed him to hold hiscommand in readiness to advance and drive the enemy from the State assoon as Vicksburg surrendered.  Steele and Ord were directed to be inreadiness to join Sherman in his move against General Johnston, andSherman was advised of this also.  Sherman moved promptly, crossing theBig Black at three different points with as many columns, allconcentrating at Bolton, twenty miles west of Jackson.Johnston heard of the surrender of Vicksburg almost as soon as itoccurred, and immediately fell back on Jackson.  On the 8th of JulySherman was within ten miles of Jackson and on the 11th was close up tothe defences of the city and shelling the town.  The siege was kept upuntil the morning of the 17th, when it was found that the enemy hadevacuated during the night.  The weather was very hot, the roads dustyand the water bad. Johnston destroyed the roads as he passed and had somuch the start that pursuit was useless; but Sherman sent one division,Steele's, to Brandon, fourteen miles east of Jackson.The National loss in the second capture of Jackson was less than onethousand men, killed, wounded and missing.  The Confederate loss wasprobably less, except in captured.  More than this number fell into ourhands as prisoners.Medicines and food were left for the Confederate wounded and sick whohad to be left behind.  A large amount of rations was issued to thefamilies that remained in Jackson.  Medicine and food were also sent toRaymond for the destitute families as well as the sick and wounded, as Ithought it only fair that we should return to these people some of thearticles we had taken while marching through the country.  I wrote toSherman: 'Impress upon the men the importance of going through the Statein an orderly manner, abstaining from taking anything not absolutelynecessary for their subsistence while travelling. They should try tocreate as favorable an impression as possible upon the people.'Provisions and forage, when called for by them, were issued to all thepeople, from Bruinsburg to Jackson and back to Vicksburg, whoseresources had been taken for the supply of our army.  Very largequantities of groceries and provisions were so issued.Sherman was ordered back to Vicksburg, and his troops took much the sameposition they had occupied before--from the Big Black to Haines' Bluff.Having cleaned up about Vicksburg and captured or routed all regularConfederate forces for more than a hundred miles in all directions, Ifelt that the troops that had done so much should be allowed to do morebefore the enemy could recover from the blow he had received, and whileimportant points might be captured without bloodshed.  I suggested tothe General-in-chief the idea of a campaign against Mobile, startingfrom Lake Pontchartrain.  Halleck preferred another course.  Thepossession of the trans-Mississippi by the Union forces seemed topossess more importance in his mind than almost any campaign east of theMississippi.  I am well aware that the President was very anxious tohave a foothold in Texas, to stop the clamor of some of the foreigngovernments which seemed to be seeking a pretext to interfere in thewar, at least so far as to recognize belligerent rights to theConfederate States.  This, however, could have been easily done withoutwasting troops in western Louisiana and eastern Texas, by sending agarrison at once to Brownsville on the Rio Grande.Halleck disapproved of my proposition to go against Mobile, so that Iwas obliged to settle down and see myself put again on the defensive asI had been a year before in west Tennessee.  It would have been an easything to capture Mobile at the time I proposed to go there.  Having thatas a base of operations, troops could have been thrown into the interiorto operate against General Bragg's army.  This would necessarily havecompelled Bragg to detach in order to meet this fire in his rear.  If hehad not done this the troops from Mobile could have inflictedinestimable damage upon much of the country from which his army andLee's were yet receiving their supplies.  I was so much impressed withthis idea that I renewed my request later in July and again about the1st of August, and proposed sending all the troops necessary, askingonly the assistance of the navy to protect the debarkation of troops ator near Mobile.  I also asked for a leave of absence to visit NewOrleans, particularly if my suggestion to move against Mobile should beapproved. Both requests were refused.  So far as my experience withGeneral Halleck went it was very much easier for him to refuse a favorthan to grant one.  But I did not regard this as a favor. It was simplyin line of duty, though out of my department.The General-in-chief having decided against me, the depletion of anarmy, which had won a succession of great victories, commenced, as hadbeen the case the year before after the fall of Corinth when the armywas sent where it would do the least good.  By orders, I sent to Banks aforce of 4,000 men; returned the 9th corps to Kentucky and, whentransportation had been collected, started a division of 5,000 men toSchofield in Missouri where Price was raiding the State.  I alsodetached a brigade under Ransom to Natchez, to garrison that placepermanently.  This latter move was quite fortunate as to the time whenRansom arrived there.  The enemy happened to have a large number, about5,000 head, of beef cattle there on the way from Texas to feed theEastern armies, and also a large amount of munitions of war which hadprobably come through Texas from the Rio Grande and which were on theway to Lee's and other armies in the East.The troops that were left with me around Vicksburg were very busily andunpleasantly employed in making expeditions against guerilla bands andsmall detachments of cavalry which infested the interior, and indestroying mills, bridges and rolling stock on the railroads.  Theguerillas and cavalry were not there to fight but to annoy, andtherefore disappeared on the first approach of our troops.The country back of Vicksburg was filled with deserters from Pemberton'sarmy and, it was reported, many from Johnston's also.  The mendetermined not to fight again while the war lasted.  Those who livedbeyond the reach of the Confederate army wanted to get to their homes.Those who did not, wanted to get North where they could work for theirsupport till the war was over.  Besides all this there was quite a peacefeeling, for the time being, among the citizens of that part ofMississippi, but this feeling soon subsided.  It is not probable thatPemberton got off with over 4,000 of his army to the camp where heproposed taking them, and these were in a demoralized condition.On the 7th of August I further depleted my army by sending the 13thcorps, General Ord commanding, to Banks.  Besides this I received ordersto co-operate with the latter general in movements west of theMississippi.  Having received this order I went to New Orleans to conferwith Banks about the proposed movement.  All these movements came tonaught.During this visit I reviewed Banks' army a short distance aboveCarrollton.  The horse I rode was vicious and but little used, and on myreturn to New Orleans ran away and, shying at a locomotive in thestreet, fell, probably on me.  I was rendered insensible, and when Iregained consciousness I found myself in a hotel near by with severaldoctors attending me.  My leg was swollen from the knee to the thigh,and the swelling, almost to the point of bursting, extended along thebody up to the arm-pit.  The pain was almost beyond endurance.  I lay atthe hotel something over a week without being able to turn myself inbed.  I had a steamer stop at the nearest point possible, and wascarried to it on a litter.  I was then taken to Vicksburg, where Iremained unable to move for some time afterwards.While I was absent General Sherman declined to assume command because,he said, it would confuse the records; but he let all the orders be madein my name, and was glad to render any assistance he could.  No orderswere issued by my staff, certainly no important orders, except uponconsultation with and approval of Sherman.On the 13th of September, while I was still in New Orleans, Hallecktelegraphed to me to send all available forces to Memphis and thence toTuscumbia, to co-operate with Rosecrans for the relief of Chattanooga.On the 15th he telegraphed again for all available forces to go toRosecrans.  This was received on the 27th.  I was still confined to mybed, unable to rise from it without assistance; but I at once orderedSherman to send one division to Memphis as fast as transports could beprovided.  The division of McPherson's corps, which had got off and wason the way to join Steele in Arkansas, was recalled and sent, likewise,to report to Hurlbut at Memphis.  Hurlbut was directed to forward thesetwo divisions with two others from his own corps at once, and also tosend any other troops that might be returning there.  Halleck suggestedthat some good man, like Sherman or McPherson, should be sent to Memphisto take charge of the troops going east. On this I sent Sherman, asbeing, I thought, the most suitable person for an independent command,and besides he was entitled to it if it had to be given to any one.  Hewas directed to take with him another division of his corps.  This leftone back, but having one of McPherson's divisions he had still theequivalent.Before the receipt by me of these orders the battle of Chickamauga hadbeen fought and Rosecrans forced back into Chattanooga. Theadministration as well as the General-in-chief was nearly frantic at thesituation of affairs there.  Mr. Charles A. Dana, an officer of the WarDepartment, was sent to Rosecrans' headquarters.  I do not know what hisinstructions were, but he was still in Chattanooga when I arrived thereat a later period.It seems that Halleck suggested that I should go to Nashville as soon asable to move and take general direction of the troops moving from thewest. I received the following dispatch dated October 3d:  'It is thewish of the Secretary of War that as soon as General Grant is able hewill come to Cairo and report by telegraph.'  I was still very lame, butstarted without delay.  Arriving at Columbus on the 16th I reported bytelegraph:  'Your dispatch from Cairo of the 3d directing me to reportfrom Cairo was received at 11.30 on the 10th.  Left the same day withstaff and headquarters and am here en route for Cairo.'
ISFP	 XL.FIRST MEETING WITH SECRETARY STANTON--GENERAL ROSECRANS--COMMANDINGMILITARY DIVISION OF MISSISSIPPI--ANDREW JOHNSON'S ADDRESS--ARRIVAL ATCHATTANOOGA.The reply (to my telegram of October 16, 1863, from Cairo, announcing myarrival at that point) came on the morning of the 17th, directing me toproceed immediately to the Galt House, Louisville, where I would meet anofficer of the War Department with my instructions.  I left Cairo withinan hour or two after the receipt of this dispatch, going by rail viaIndianapolis. Just as the train I was on was starting out of the depotat Indianapolis a messenger came running up to stop it, saying theSecretary of War was coming into the station and wanted to see me.I had never met Mr. Stanton up to that time, though we had held frequentconversations over the wires the year before, when I was in Tennessee.Occasionally at night he would order the wires between the WarDepartment and my headquarters to be connected, and we would hold aconversation for an hour or two.  On this occasion the Secretary wasaccompanied by Governor Brough of Ohio, whom I had never met, though heand my father had been old acquaintances.  Mr. Stanton dismissed thespecial train that had brought him to Indianapolis, and accompanied meto Louisville.Up to this time no hint had been given me of what was wanted after Ileft Vicksburg, except the suggestion in one of Halleck's dispatchesthat I had better go to Nashville and superintend the operation oftroops sent to relieve Rosecrans. Soon after we started the Secretaryhanded me two orders, saying that I might take my choice of them.  Thetwo were identical in all but one particular.  Both created the'Military Division of Mississippi,' (giving me the command) composed ofthe Departments of the Ohio, the Cumberland, and the Tennessee, and allthe territory from the Alleghanies to the Mississippi River north ofBanks's command in the south-west.  One order left the departmentcommanders as they were, while the other relieved Rosecrans and assignedThomas to his place.  I accepted the latter.  We reached Louisvilleafter night and, if I remember rightly, in a cold, drizzling rain.  TheSecretary of War told me afterwards that he caught a cold on thatoccasion from which he never expected to recover.  He never did.A day was spent in Louisville, the Secretary giving me the military newsat the capital and talking about the disappointment at the results ofsome of the campaigns.  By the evening of the day after our arrival allmatters of discussion seemed exhausted, and I left the hotel to spendthe evening away, both Mrs. Grant (who was with me) and myself havingrelatives living in Louisville.  In the course of the evening Mr.Stanton received a dispatch from Mr. C. A. Dana, then in Chattanooga,informing him that unless prevented Rosecrans would retreat, andadvising peremptory orders against his doing so.As stated before, after the fall of Vicksburg I urged strongly upon thegovernment the propriety of a movement against Mobile.  GeneralRosecrans had been at Murfreesboro', Tennessee, with a large andwell-equipped army from early in the year 1863, with Bragg confrontinghim with a force quite equal to his own at first, considering it was onthe defensive.  But after the investment of Vicksburg Bragg's army waslargely depleted to strengthen Johnston, in Mississippi, who was beingreinforced to raise the siege.  I frequently wrote General Hallecksuggesting that Rosecrans should move against Bragg.  By so doing hewould either detain the latter's troops where they were or layChattanooga open to capture.  General Halleck strongly approved thesuggestion, and finally wrote me that he had repeatedly orderedRosecrans to advance, but that the latter had constantly failed tocomply with the order, and at last, after having held a council of war,had replied in effect that it was a military maxim 'not to fight twodecisive battles at the same time.'  If true, the maxim was notapplicable in this case.  It would be bad to be defeated in two decisivebattles fought the same day, but it would not be bad to win them.  I,however, was fighting no battle, and the siege of Vicksburg had drawnfrom Rosecrans' front so many of the enemy that his chances of victorywere much greater than they would be if he waited until the siege wasover, when these troops could be returned.  Rosecrans was ordered tomove against the army that was detaching troops to raise the siege.Finally he did move, on the 24th of June, but ten days afterwardsVicksburg surrendered, and the troops sent from Bragg were free toreturn.It was at this time that I recommended to the general-in-chief themovement against Mobile.  I knew the peril the Army of the Cumberlandwas in, being depleted continually, not only by ordinary casualties, butalso by having to detach troops to hold its constantly extending lineover which to draw supplies, while the enemy in front was as constantlybeing strengthened.  Mobile was important to the enemy, and in theabsence of a threatening force was guarded by little else thanartillery.  If threatened by land and from the water at the same timethe prize would fall easily, or troops would have to be sent to itsdefence.  Those troops would necessarily come from Bragg.  My judgmentwas overruled, and the troops under my command were dissipated overother parts of the country where it was thought they could render themost service.Soon it was discovered in Washington that Rosecrans was in trouble andrequired assistance.  The emergency was now too immediate to allow us togive this assistance by making an attack in rear of Bragg upon Mobile.It was therefore necessary to reinforce directly, and troops were sentfrom every available point.Rosecrans had very skilfully manoeuvred Bragg south of the TennesseeRiver, and through and beyond Chattanooga. If he had stopped andintrenched, and made himself strong there, all would have been right andthe mistake of not moving earlier partially compensated.  But he pushedon, with his forces very much scattered, until Bragg's troops fromMississippi began to join him.  Then Bragg took the initiative.Rosecrans had to fall back in turn, and was able to get his armytogether at Chickamauga, some miles south-east of Chattanooga, beforethe main battle was brought on.  The battle was fought on the 19th and20th of September, and Rosecrans was badly defeated, with a heavy lossin artillery and some sixteen thousand men killed, wounded and captured.The corps under Major-General George H. Thomas stood its ground, whileRosecrans, with Crittenden and McCook, returned to Chattanooga. Thomasreturned also, but later, and with his troops in good order.  Braggfollowed and took possession of Missionary Ridge, overlookingChattanooga. He also occupied Lookout Mountain, west of the town, whichRosecrans had abandoned, and with it his control of the river and theriver road as far back as Bridgeport.  The National troops were nowstrongly intrenched in Chattanooga Valley, with the Tennessee Riverbehind them and the enemy occupying commanding heights to the east andwest, with a strong line across the valley from mountain to mountain,and with Chattanooga Creek, for a large part of the way, in front oftheir line.On the 29th Halleck telegraphed me the above results, and directed allthe forces that could be spared from my department to be sent toRosecrans.  Long before this dispatch was received Sherman was on hisway, and McPherson was moving east with most of the garrison ofVicksburg.A retreat at that time would have been a terrible disaster.  It wouldnot only have been the loss of a most important strategic position tous, but it would have been attended with the loss of all the artillerystill left with the Army of the Cumberland and the annihilation of thatarmy itself, either by capture or demoralization.All supplies for Rosecrans had to be brought from Nashville. Therailroad between this base and the army was in possession of thegovernment up to Bridgeport, the point at which the road crosses to thesouth side of the Tennessee River; but Bragg, holding Lookout andRaccoon mountains west of Chattanooga, commanded the railroad, the riverand the shortest and best wagon-roads, both south and north of theTennessee, between Chattanooga and Bridgeport.  The distance betweenthese two places is but twenty-six miles by rail, but owing to theposition of Bragg, all supplies for Rosecrans had to be hauled by acircuitous route north of the river and over a mountainous country,increasing the distance to over sixty miles.This country afforded but little food for his animals, nearly tenthousand of which had already starved, and not enough were left to drawa single piece of artillery or even the ambulances to convey the sick.The men had been on half rations of hard bread for a considerable time,with but few other supplies except beef driven from Nashville across thecountry.  The region along the road became so exhausted of food for thecattle that by the time they reached Chattanooga they were much in thecondition of the few animals left alive there--'on the lift.' Indeed,the beef was so poor that the soldiers were in the habit of saying, witha faint facetiousness, that they were living on 'half rations of hardbread and BEEF DRIED ON THE HOOF.'Nothing could be transported but food, and the troops were withoutsufficient shoes or other clothing suitable for the advancing season.What they had was well worn.  The fuel within the Federal lines wasexhausted, even to the stumps of trees. There were no teams to draw itfrom the opposite bank, where it was abundant.  The only way ofsupplying fuel, for some time before my arrival, had been to cut treeson the north bank of the river at a considerable distance up the stream,form rafts of it and float it down with the current, effecting a landingon the south side within our lines by the use of paddles or poles. Itwould then be carried on the shoulders of the men to their camps.If a retreat had occurred at this time it is not probable that any ofthe army would have reached the railroad as an organized body, iffollowed by the enemy.On the receipt of Mr. Dana's dispatch Mr. Stanton sent for me. Findingthat I was out he became nervous and excited, inquiring of every personhe met, including guests of the house, whether they knew where I was,and bidding them find me and send me to him at once.  About eleveno'clock I returned to the hotel, and on my way, when near the house,every person met was a messenger from the Secretary, apparentlypartaking of his impatience to see me.  I hastened to the room of theSecretary and found him pacing the floor rapidly in his dressing-gown.Saying that the retreat must be prevented, he showed me the dispatch.  Iimmediately wrote an order assuming command of the Military Division ofthe Mississippi, and telegraphed it to General Rosecrans.  I thentelegraphed to him the order from Washington assigning Thomas to thecommand of the Army of the Cumberland; and to Thomas that he must holdChattanooga at all hazards, informing him at the same time that I wouldbe at the front as soon as possible.  A prompt reply was received fromThomas, saying, 'We will hold the town till we starve.'  I appreciatedthe force of this dispatch later when I witnessed the condition ofaffairs which prompted it.  It looked, indeed, as if but two courseswere open:  one to starve, the other to surrender or be captured.On the morning of the 20th of October I started, with my staff, andproceeded as far as Nashville.  At that time it was not prudent totravel beyond that point by night, so I remained in Nashville until thenext morning.  Here I met for the first time Andrew Johnson, MilitaryGovernor of Tennessee.  He delivered a speech of welcome.  His composureshowed that it was by no means his maiden effort.  It was long, and Iwas in torture while he was delivering it, fearing something would beexpected from me in response.  I was relieved, however, the peopleassembled having apparently heard enough.  At all events they commenceda general hand-shaking, which, although trying where there is so much ofit, was a great relief to me in this emergency.From Nashville I telegraphed to Burnside, who was then at Knoxville,that important points in his department ought to be fortified, so thatthey could be held with the least number of men; to Admiral Porter atCairo, that Sherman's advance had passed Eastport, Mississippi, thatrations were probably on their way from St. Louis by boat for supplyinghis army, and requesting him to send a gunboat to convoy them; and toThomas, suggesting that large parties should be put at work on thewagon-road then in use back to Bridgeport.On the morning of the 21st we took the train for the front, reachingStevenson Alabama, after dark.  Rosecrans was there on his way north.He came into my car and we held a brief interview, in which he describedvery clearly the situation at Chattanooga, and made some excellentsuggestions as to what should be done.  My only wonder was that he hadnot carried them out.  We then proceeded to Bridgeport, where we stoppedfor the night.  From here we took horses and made our way by Jasper andover Waldron's Ridge to Chattanooga. There had been much rain, and theroads were almost impassable from mud, knee-deep in places, and fromwash-outs on the mountain sides.  I had been on crutches since the timeof my fall in New Orleans, and had to be carried over places where itwas not safe to cross on horseback.  The roads were strewn with thedebris of broken wagons and the carcasses of thousands of starved mulesand horses.  At Jasper, some ten or twelve miles from Bridgeport, therewas a halt.  General O. O. Howard had his headquarters there.  From thispoint I telegraphed Burnside to make every effort to secure five hundredrounds of ammunition for his artillery and small-arms.  We stopped forthe night at a little hamlet some ten or twelve miles farther on.  Thenext day we reached Chattanooga a little before dark.  I went directlyto General Thomas's headquarters, and remaining there a few days, untilI could establish my own.During the evening most of the general officers called in to pay theirrespects and to talk about the condition of affairs.  They pointed outon the map the line, marked with a red or blue pencil, which Rosecranshad contemplated falling back upon.  If any of them had approved themove they did not say so to me.  I found General W. F. Smith occupyingthe position of chief engineer of the Army of the Cumberland.  I hadknown Smith as a cadet at West Point, but had no recollection of havingmet him after my graduation, in 1843, up to this time.  He explained thesituation of the two armies and the topography of the country so plainlythat I could see it without an inspection.  I found that he hadestablished a saw-mill on the banks of the river, by utilizing an oldengine found in the neighborhood; and, by rafting logs from the northside of the river above, had got out the lumber and completed pontoonsand roadway plank for a second bridge, one flying bridge being therealready.  He was also rapidly getting out the materials and constructingthe boats for a third bridge.  In addition to this he had far under waya steamer for plying between Chattanooga and Bridgeport whenever wemight get possession of the river.  This boat consisted of a scow, madeof the plank sawed out at the mill, housed in, and a stern wheelattached which was propelled by a second engine taken from some shop orfactory.I telegraphed to Washington this night, notifying General Halleck of myarrival, and asking to have General Sherman assigned to the command ofthe Army of the Tennessee, headquarters in the field.  The request wasat once complied with.
ISFP	 XLI.ASSUMING THE COMMAND AT CHATTANOOGA--OPENING A LINE OF SUPPLIES--BATTLEOF WAUHATCHIE--ON THE PICKET LINE.The next day, the 24th, I started out to make a personal inspection,taking Thomas and Smith with me, besides most of the members of mypersonal staff.  We crossed to the north side of the river, and, movingto the north of detached spurs of hills, reached the Tennessee atBrown's Ferry, some three miles below Lookout Mountain, unobserved bythe enemy.  Here we left our horses back from the river and approachedthe water on foot. There was a picket station of the enemy on theopposite side, of about twenty men, in full view, and we were withineasy range. They did not fire upon us nor seem to be disturbed by ourpresence.  They must have seen that we were all commissioned officers.But, I suppose, they looked upon the garrison of Chattanooga asprisoners of war, feeding or starving themselves, and thought it wouldbe inhuman to kill any of them except in self-defence.That night I issued orders for opening the route to Bridgeport--acracker line, as the soldiers appropriately termed it.  They had been solong on short rations that my first thought was the establishment of aline over which food might reach them.Chattanooga is on the south bank of the Tennessee, where that river runsnearly due west.  It is at the northern end of a valley five or sixmiles in width, through which Chattanooga Creek runs.  To the east ofthe valley is Missionary Ridge, rising from five to eight hundred feetabove the creek and terminating somewhat abruptly a half mile or morebefore reaching the Tennessee.  On the west of the valley is LookoutMountain, twenty-two hundred feet above-tide water.  Just below the townthe Tennessee makes a turn to the south and runs to the base of LookoutMountain, leaving no level ground between the mountain and river.  TheMemphis and Charleston Railroad passes this point, where the mountainstands nearly perpendicular. East of Missionary Ridge flows the SouthChickamauga River; west of Lookout Mountain is Lookout Creek; and westof that, Raccoon Mountains.  Lookout Mountain, at its northern end,rises almost perpendicularly for some distance, then breaks off in agentle slope of cultivated fields to near the summit, where it ends in apalisade thirty or more feet in height.  On the gently sloping ground,between the upper and lower palisades, there is a single farmhouse,which is reached by a wagon-road from the valley east.The intrenched line of the enemy commenced on the north end ofMissionary Ridge and extended along the crest for some distance south,thence across Chattanooga valley to Lookout Mountain. Lookout Mountainwas also fortified and held by the enemy, who also kept troops inLookout valley west, and on Raccoon Mountain, with pickets extendingdown the river so as to command the road on the north bank and render ituseless to us.  In addition to this there was an intrenched line inChattanooga valley extending from the river east of the town to LookoutMountain, to make the investment complete.  Besides the fortificationson Mission Ridge, there was a line at the base of the hill, withoccasional spurs of rifle-pits half-way up the front.  The enemy'spickets extended out into the valley towards the town, so far that thepickets of the two armies could converse.  At one point they wereseparated only by the narrow creek which gives its name to the valleyand town, and from which both sides drew water.  The Union lines wereshorter than those of the enemy.Thus the enemy, with a vastly superior force, was strongly fortified tothe east, south, and west, and commanded the river below.  Practically,the Army of the Cumberland was besieged. The enemy had stopped with hiscavalry north of the river the passing of a train loaded with ammunitionand medical supplies.  The Union army was short of both, not havingammunition enough for a day's fighting.General Halleck had, long before my coming into this new field, orderedparts of the 11th and 12th corps, commanded respectively by GeneralsHoward and Slocum, Hooker in command of the whole, from the Army of thePotomac to reinforce Rosecrans.  It would have been folly to send themto Chattanooga to help eat up the few rations left there.  They wereconsequently left on the railroad, where supplies could be brought tothem.  Before my arrival, Thomas ordered their concentration atBridgeport.General W. F. Smith had been so instrumental in preparing for the movewhich I was now about to make, and so clear in his judgment about themanner of making it, that I deemed it but just to him that he shouldhave command of the troops detailed to execute the design, although hewas then acting as a staff officer and was not in command of troops.On the 24th of October, after my return to Chattanooga, the followingdetails were made:  General Hooker, who was now at Bridgeport, wasordered to cross to the south side of the Tennessee and march up byWhitesides and Wauhatchie to Brown's Ferry.  General Palmer, with adivision of the 14th corps, Army of the Cumberland, was ordered to movedown the river on the north side, by a back road, until oppositeWhitesides, then cross and hold the road in Hooker's rear after he hadpassed. Four thousand men were at the same time detailed to act underGeneral Smith directly from Chattanooga. Eighteen hundred of them, underGeneral Hazen, were to take sixty pontoon boats, and under cover ofnight float by the pickets of the enemy at the north base of Lookout,down to Brown's Ferry, then land on the south side and capture or driveaway the pickets at that point.  Smith was to march with the remainderof the detail, also under cover of night, by the north bank of the riverto Brown's Ferry, taking with him all the material for laying the bridgeas soon as the crossing was secured.On the 26th, Hooker crossed the river at Bridgeport and commenced hiseastward march.  At three o'clock on the morning of the 27th, Hazenmoved into the stream with his sixty pontoons and eighteen hundred braveand well-equipped men.  Smith started enough in advance to be near theriver when Hazen should arrive.  There are a number of detached spurs ofhills north of the river at Chattanooga, back of which is a good roadparallel to the stream, sheltered from the view from the top of Lookout.It was over this road Smith marched.  At five o'clock Hazen landed atBrown's Ferry, surprised the picket guard, and captured most of it.  Byseven o'clock the whole of Smith's force was ferried over and inpossession of a height commanding the ferry.  This was speedilyfortified, while a detail was laying the pontoon bridge.  By ten o'clockthe bridge was laid, and our extreme right, now in Lookout valley, wasfortified and connected with the rest of the army.  The two bridges overthe Tennessee River--a flying one at Chattanooga and the new one atBrown's Ferry--with the road north of the river, covered from both thefire and the view of the enemy, made the connection complete.  Hookerfound but slight obstacles in his way, and on the afternoon of the 28themerged into Lookout valley at Wauhatchie.  Howard marched on to Brown'sFerry, while Geary, who commanded a division in the 12th corps, stoppedthree miles south.  The pickets of the enemy on the river below were nowcut off, and soon came in and surrendered.The river was now opened to us from Lookout valley to Bridgeport.Between Brown's Ferry and Kelly's Ferry the Tennessee runs through anarrow gorge in the mountains, which contracts the stream so much as toincrease the current beyond the capacity of an ordinary steamer to stemit.  To get up these rapids, steamers must be cordelled; that is, pulledup by ropes from the shore.  But there is no difficulty in navigatingthe stream from Bridgeport to Kelly's Ferry.  The latter point is onlyeight miles from Chattanooga and connected with it by a good wagon-road,which runs through a low pass in the Raccoon Mountains on the south sideof the river to Brown's Ferry, thence on the north side to the riveropposite Chattanooga. There were several steamers at Bridgeport, andabundance of forage, clothing and provisions.On the way to Chattanooga I had telegraphed back to Nashville for a goodsupply of vegetables and small rations, which the troops had been solong deprived of.  Hooker had brought with him from the east a fullsupply of land transportation.  His animals had not been subjected tohard work on bad roads without forage, but were in good condition.  Infive days from my arrival in Chattanooga the way was open to Bridgeportand, with the aid of steamers and Hooker's teams, in a week the troopswere receiving full rations.  It is hard for any one not an eye-witnessto realize the relief this brought.  The men were soon reclothed andalso well fed, an abundance of ammunition was brought up, and acheerfulness prevailed not before enjoyed in many weeks.  Neitherofficers nor men looked upon themselves any longer as doomed.  The weakand languid appearance of the troops, so visible before, disappeared atonce.  I do not know what the effect was on the other side, but assumeit must have been correspondingly depressing.  Mr. Davis had visitedBragg but a short time before, and must have perceived our condition tobe about as Bragg described it in his subsequent report.  'Thesedispositions,' he said, 'faithfully sustained, insured the enemy'sspeedy evacuation of Chattanooga for want of food and forage.  Possessedof the shortest route to his depot, and the one by which reinforcementsmust reach him, we held him at our mercy, and his destruction was only aquestion of time.'  But the dispositions were not 'faithfullysustained,' and I doubt not but thousands of men engaged in trying to'sustain' them now rejoice that they were not.  There was no time duringthe rebellion when I did not think, and often say, that the South wasmore to be benefited by its defeat than the North.  The latter had thepeople, the institutions, and the territory to make a great andprosperous nation.  The former was burdened with an institutionabhorrent to all civilized people not brought up under it, and one whichdegraded labor, kept it in ignorance, and enervated the governing class.With the outside world at war with this institution, they could not haveextended their territory.  The labor of the country was not skilled, norallowed to become so.  The whites could not toil without becomingdegraded, and those who did were denominated 'poor white trash.'  Thesystem of labor would have soon exhausted the soil and left the peoplepoor.  The non-slaveholders would have left the country, and the smallslaveholder must have sold out to his more fortunate neighbor.  Soon theslaves would have outnumbered the masters, and, not being in sympathywith them, would have risen in their might and exterminated them.  Thewar was expensive to the South as well as to the North, both in bloodand treasure, but it was worth all it cost.The enemy was surprised by the movements which secured to us a line ofsupplies.  He appreciated its importance, and hastened to try to recoverthe line from us.  His strength on Lookout Mountain was not equal toHooker's command in the valley below.  From Missionary Ridge he had tomarch twice the distance we had from Chattanooga, in order to reachLookout Valley; but on the night of the 28th and 29th an attack was madeon Geary at Wauhatchie by Longstreet's corps.  When the battlecommenced, Hooker ordered Howard up from Brown's Ferry.  He had threemiles to march to reach Geary.  On his way he was fired upon by rebeltroops from a foot-hill to the left of the road and from which the roadwas commanded.  Howard turned to the left, charged up the hill andcaptured it before the enemy had time to intrench, taking manyprisoners.  Leaving sufficient men to hold this height, he pushed on toreinforce Geary.  Before he got up, Geary had been engaged for aboutthree hours against a vastly superior force.  The night was so dark thatthe men could not distinguish one from another except by the light ofthe flashes of their muskets.  In the darkness and uproar Hooker'steamsters became frightened and deserted their teams.  The mules alsobecame frightened, and breaking loose from their fastenings stampededdirectly towards the enemy.  The latter, no doubt, took this for acharge, and stampeded in turn.  By four o'clock in the morning thebattle had entirely ceased, and our 'cracker line' was never afterwarddisturbed.In securing possession of Lookout Valley, Smith lost one man killed andfour or five wounded.  The enemy lost most of his pickets at the ferry,captured.  In the night engagement of the 28th-9th Hooker lost 416killed and wounded.  I never knew the loss of the enemy, but our troopsburied over one hundred and fifty of his dead and captured more than ahundred.After we had secured the opening of a line over which to bring oursupplies to the army, I made a personal inspection to see the situationof the pickets of the two armies.  As I have stated, Chattanooga Creekcomes down the centre of the valley to within a mile or such a matter ofthe town of Chattanooga, then bears off westerly, then north-westerly,and enters the Tennessee River at the foot of Lookout Mountain.  Thiscreek, from its mouth up to where it bears off west, lay between the twolines of pickets, and the guards of both armies drew their water fromthe same stream.  As I would be under short-range fire and in an opencountry, I took nobody with me, except, I believe, a bugler, who stayedsome distance to the rear.  I rode from our right around to our left.When I came to the camp of the picket guard of our side, I heard thecall, 'Turn out the guard for the commanding general.'  I replied,'Never mind the guard,' and they were dismissed and went back to theirtents. Just back of these, and about equally distant from the creek,were the guards of the Confederate pickets.  The sentinel on their postcalled out in like manner, 'Turn out the guard for the commandinggeneral,' and, I believe, added, 'General Grant.'  Their line in amoment front-faced to the north, facing me, and gave a salute, which Ireturned.The most friendly relations seemed to exist between the pickets of thetwo armies.  At one place there was a tree which had fallen across thestream, and which was used by the soldiers of both armies in drawingwater for their camps.  General Longstreet's corps was stationed thereat the time, and wore blue of a little different shade from our uniform.Seeing a soldier in blue on this log, I rode up to him, commencedconversing with him, and asked whose corps he belonged to.  He was verypolite, and, touching his hat to me, said he belonged to GeneralLongstreet's corps.  I asked him a few questions--but not with a view ofgaining any particular information--all of which he answered, and I rodeoff.
ISFP	 XLII.CONDITION OF THE ARMY--REBUILDING THE RAILROAD--GENERAL BURNSIDE'SSITUATION--ORDERS FOR BATTLE--PLANS FOR THE ATTACK--HOOKER'S POSITION--SHERMAN'S MOVEMENTS.Having got the Army of the Cumberland in a comfortable position, I nowbegan to look after the remainder of my new command. Burnside was inabout as desperate a condition as the Army of the Cumberland had been,only he was not yet besieged.  He was a hundred miles from the nearESTJossible base, Big South Fork of the Cumberland River, and much fartherfrom any railroad we had possession of.  The roads back were overmountains, and all supplies along the line had long since beenexhausted.  His animals, too, had been starved, and their carcasseslined the road from Cumberland Gap, and far back towards Lexington, Ky.East Tennessee still furnished supplies of beef, bread and forage, butit did not supply ammunition, clothing, medical supplies, or smallrations, such as coffee, sugar, salt and rice.Sherman had started from Memphis for Corinth on the 11th of October.His instructions required him to repair the road in his rear in order tobring up supplies.  The distance was about three hundred and thirtymiles through a hostile country.  His entire command could not havemaintained the road if it had been completed.  The bridges had all beendestroyed by the enemy, and much other damage done.  A hostile communitylived along the road; guerilla bands infested the country, and more orless of the cavalry of the enemy was still in the West.  Often Sherman'swork was destroyed as soon as completed, and he only a short distanceaway.The Memphis and Charleston Railroad strikes the Tennessee River atEastport, Mississippi.  Knowing the difficulty Sherman would have tosupply himself from Memphis, I had previously ordered supplies sent fromSt. Louis on small steamers, to be convoyed by the navy, to meet him atEastport.  These he got.  I now ordered him to discontinue his work ofrepairing roads and to move on with his whole force to Stevenson,Alabama, without delay.  This order was borne to Sherman by a messenger,who paddled down the Tennessee in a canoe and floated over MuscleShoals; it was delivered at Iuka on the 27th.  In this Sherman wasnotified that the rebels were moving a force towards Cleveland, EastTennessee, and might be going to Nashville, in which event his troopswere in the best position to beat them there.  Sherman, with hischaracteristic promptness, abandoned the work he was engaged upon andpushed on at once.  On the 1st of November he crossed the Tennessee atEastport, and that day was in Florence, Alabama, with the head ofcolumn, while his troops were still crossing at Eastport, with Blairbringing up the rear.Sherman's force made an additional army, with cavalry, artillery, andtrains, all to be supplied by the single track road from Nashville.  Allindications pointed also to the probable necessity of supplyingBurnside's command in East Tennessee, twenty-five thousand more, by thesame route.  A single track could not do this.  I gave, therefore, anorder to Sherman to halt General G. M. Dodge's command, of about eightthousand men, at Athens, and subsequently directed the latter to arrangehis troops along the railroad from Decatur north towards Nashville, andto rebuild that road.  The road from Nashville to Decatur passes over abroken country, cut up with innumerable streams, many of them ofconsiderable width, and with valleys far below the road-bed.  All thebridges over these had been destroyed, and the rails taken up andtwisted by the enemy.  All the cars and locomotives not carried off hadbeen destroyed as effectually as they knew how to destroy them.  Allbridges and culverts had been destroyed between Nashville and Decatur,and thence to Stevenson, where the Memphis and Charleston and theNashville and Chattanooga roads unite.  The rebuilding of this roadwould give us two roads as far as Stevenson over which to supply thearmy.  From Bridgeport, a short distance farther east, the riversupplements the road.General Dodge, besides being a most capable soldier, was an experiencedrailroad builder.  He had no tools to work with except those of thepioneers--axes, picks, and spades.  With these he was able to intrenchhis men and protect them against surprises by small parties of theenemy.  As he had no base of supplies until the road could be completedback to Nashville, the first matter to consider after protecting his menwas the getting in of food and forage from the surrounding country.  Hehad his men and teams bring in all the grain they could find, or allthey needed, and all the cattle for beef, and such other food as couldbe found.  Millers were detailed from the ranks to run the mills alongthe line of the army.  When these were not near enough to the troops forprotection they were taken down and moved up to the line of the road.Blacksmith shops, with all the iron and steel found in them, were movedup in like manner.  Blacksmiths were detailed and set to work making thetools necessary in railroad and bridge building.  Axemen were put towork getting out timber for bridges and cutting fuel for locomotiveswhen the road should be completed.  Car-builders were set to workrepairing the locomotives and cars.  Thus every branch of railroadbuilding, making tools to work with, and supplying the workmen withfood, was all going on at once, and without the aid of a mechanic orlaborer except what the command itself furnished.  But rails and carsthe men could not make without material, and there was not enoughrolling stock to keep the road we already had worked to its fullcapacity.  There were no rails except those in use.  To supply thesedeficiencies I ordered eight of the ten engines General McPherson had atVicksburg to be sent to Nashville, and all the cars he had except ten.I also ordered the troops in West Tennessee to points on the river andon the Memphis and Charleston road, and ordered the cars, locomotivesand rails from all the railroads except the Memphis and Charleston toNashville.  The military manager of railroads also was directed tofurnish more rolling stock and, as far as he could, bridge material.General Dodge had the work assigned him finished within forty days afterreceiving his orders.  The number of bridges to rebuild was one hundredand eighty-two, many of them over deep and wide chasms; the length ofroad repaired was one hundred and two miles.The enemy's troops, which it was thought were either moving againstBurnside or were going to Nashville, went no farther than Cleveland.Their presence there, however, alarmed the authorities at Washington,and, on account of our helpless condition at Chattanooga, caused me muchuneasiness.  Dispatches were constantly coming, urging me to dosomething for Burnside's relief; calling attention to the importance ofholding East Tennessee; saying the President was much concerned for theprotection of the loyal people in that section, etc.  We had not atChattanooga animals to pull a single piece of artillery, much less asupply train.  Reinforcements could not help Burnside, because he hadneither supplies nor ammunition sufficient for them; hardly, indeed,bread and meat for the men he had.  There was no relief possible for himexcept by expelling the enemy from Missionary Ridge and aboutChattanooga.On the 4th of November Longstreet left our front with about fifteenthousand troops, besides Wheeler's cavalry, five thousand more, to goagainst Burnside.  The situation seemed desperate, and was moreaggravating because nothing could be done until Sherman should get up.The authorities at Washington were now more than ever anxious for thesafety of Burnside's army, and plied me with dispatches faster thanever, urging that something should be done for his relief.  On the 7th,before Longstreet could possibly have reached Knoxville, I orderedThomas peremptorily to attack the enemy's right, so as to force thereturn of the troops that had gone up the valley.  I directed him totake mules, officers' horses, or animals wherever he could get them tomove the necessary artillery.  But he persisted in the declaration thathe could not move a single piece of artillery, and could not see how hecould possibly comply with the order.  Nothing was left to be done butto answer Washington dispatches as best I could; urge Sherman forward,although he was making every effort to get forward, and encourageBurnside to hold on, assuring him that in a short time he should berelieved.  All of Burnside's dispatches showed the greatest confidencein his ability to hold his position as long as his ammunition held out.He even suggested the propriety of abandoning the territory he heldsouth and west of Knoxville, so as to draw the enemy farther from hisbase and make it more difficult for him to get back to Chattanooga whenthe battle should begin.  Longstreet had a railroad as far as Loudon;but from there to Knoxville he had to rely on wagon trains. Burnside'ssuggestion, therefore, was a good one, and it was adopted.  On the 14thI telegraphed him:'Sherman's advance has reached Bridgeport.  His whole force will beready to move from there by Tuesday at farthest.  If you can holdLongstreet in check until he gets up, or by skirmishing and falling backcan avoid serious loss to yourself and gain time, I will be able toforce the enemy back from here and place a force between Longstreet andBragg that must inevitably make the former take to the mountain-passesby every available road, to get to his supplies.  Sherman would havebeen here before this but for high water in Elk River driving him somethirty miles up that river to cross.'And again later in the day, indicating my plans for his relief, asfollows:'Your dispatch and Dana's just received.  Being there, you can tellbetter how to resist Longstreet's attack than I can direct.  With yourshowing you had better give up Kingston at the last moment and save themost productive part of your possessions.  Every arrangement is now madeto throw Sherman's force across the river, just at and below the mouthof Chickamauga Creek, as soon as it arrives.  Thomas will attack on hisleft at the same time, and together it is expected to carry MissionaryRidge, and from there push a force on to the railroad between Clevelandand Dalton.  Hooker will at the same time attack, and, if he can, carryLookout Mountain.  The enemy now seems to be looking for an attack onhis left flank.  This favors us.  To further confirm this, Sherman'sadvance division will march direct from Whiteside to Trenton.  Theremainder of his force will pass over a new road just made fromWhiteside to Kelly's Ferry, thus being concealed from the enemy, andleave him to suppose the whole force is going up Lookout Valley.Sherman's advance has only just reached Bridgeport.  The rear will onlyreach there on the 16th.  This will bring it to the 19th as the earliestday for making the combined movement as desired.  Inform me if you thinkyou can sustain yourself until this time.  I can hardly conceive of theenemy breaking through at Kingston and pushing for Kentucky.  If theyshould, however, a new problem would be left for solution.  Thomas hasordered a division of cavalry to the vicinity of Sparta. I willascertain if they have started, and inform you.  It will be entirely outof the question to send you ten thousand men, not because they cannot bespared, but how would they be fed after they got even one day east fromhere?'Longstreet, for some reason or other, stopped at Loudon until the 13th.That being the terminus of his railroad communications, it is probablehe was directed to remain there awaiting orders.  He was in a positionthreatening Knoxville, and at the same time where he could be broughtback speedily to Chattanooga. The day after Longstreet left Loudon,Sherman reached Bridgeport in person and proceeded on to see me thatevening, the 14th, and reached Chattanooga the next day.My orders for battle were all prepared in advance of Sherman's arrival(*15), except the dates, which could not be fixed while troops to beengaged were so far away.  The possession of Lookout Mountain was of nospecial advantage to us now.  Hooker was instructed to send Howard'scorps to the north side of the Tennessee, thence up behind the hills onthe north side, and to go into camp opposite Chattanooga; with theremainder of the command, Hooker was, at a time to be afterwardsappointed, to ascend the western slope between the upper and lowerpalisades, and so get into Chattanooga valley.The plan of battle was for Sherman to attack the enemy's right flank,form a line across it, extend our left over South Chickamauga River soas to threaten or hold the railroad in Bragg's rear, and thus force himeither to weaken his lines elsewhere or lose his connection with hisbase at Chickamauga Station.  Hooker was to perform like service on ourright.  His problem was to get from Lookout Valley to Chattanooga Valleyin the most expeditious way possible; cross the latter valley rapidly toRossville, south of Bragg's line on Missionary Ridge, form line thereacross the ridge facing north, with his right flank extended toChickamauga Valley east of the ridge, thus threatening the enemy's rearon that flank and compelling him to reinforce this also.  Thomas, withthe Army of the Cumberland, occupied the centre, and was to assaultwhile the enemy was engaged with most of his forces on his two flanks.To carry out this plan, Sherman was to cross the Tennessee at Brown'sFerry and move east of Chattanooga to a point opposite the north end ofMission Ridge, and to place his command back of the foot-hills out ofsight of the enemy on the ridge.  There are two streams calledChickamauga emptying into the Tennessee River east of Chattanooga--NorthChickamauga, taking its rise in Tennessee, flowing south, and emptyinginto the river some seven or eight miles east; while the SouthChickamauga, which takes its rise in Georgia, flows northward, andempties into the Tennessee some three or four miles above the town.There were now one hundred and sixteen pontoons in the North ChickamaugaRiver, their presence there being unknown to the enemy.At night a division was to be marched up to that point, and at twoo'clock in the morning moved down with the current, thirty men in eachboat.  A few were to land east of the mouth of the South Chickamauga,capture the pickets there, and then lay a bridge connecting the twobanks of the river.  The rest were to land on the south side of theTennessee, where Missionary Ridge would strike it if prolonged, and asufficient number of men to man the boats were to push to the north sideto ferry over the main body of Sherman's command while those left on thesouth side intrenched themselves.  Thomas was to move out from his linesfacing the ridge, leaving enough of Palmer's corps to guard against anattack down the valley.  Lookout Valley being of no present value to us,and being untenable by the enemy if we should secure Missionary Ridge,Hooker's orders were changed.  His revised orders brought him toChattanooga by the established route north of the Tennessee.  He wasthen to move out to the right to Rossville.Hooker's position in Lookout Valley was absolutely essential to us solong as Chattanooga was besieged.  It was the key to our line forsupplying the army.  But it was not essential after the enemy wasdispersed from our front, or even after the battle for this purpose wasbegun.  Hooker's orders, therefore, were designed to get his force pastLookout Mountain and Chattanooga Valley, and up to Missionary Ridge.  Bycrossing the north face of Lookout the troops would come intoChattanooga Valley in rear of the line held by the enemy across thevalley, and would necessarily force its evacuation.  Orders wereaccordingly given to march by this route.  But days before the battlebegan the advantages as well as the disadvantages of this plan of actionwere all considered.  The passage over the mountain was a difficult oneto make in the face of an enemy.  It might consume so much time as tolose us the use of the troops engaged in it at other points where theywere more wanted.  After reaching Chattanooga Valley, the creek of thesame name, quite a formidable stream to get an army over, had to becrossed.  I was perfectly willing that the enemy should keep LookoutMountain until we got through with the troops on Missionary Ridge.  Bymarching Hooker to the north side of the river, thence up the stream,and recrossing at the town, he could be got in position at any namedtime; when in this new position, he would have Chattanooga Creek behindhim, and the attack on Missionary Ridge would unquestionably cause theevacuation by the enemy of his line across the valley and on LookoutMountain.  Hooker's order was changed accordingly.  As explainedelsewhere, the original order had to be reverted to, because of a floodin the river rendering the bridge at Brown's Ferry unsafe for thepassage of troops at the exact juncture when it was wanted to bring allthe troops together against Missionary Ridge.The next day after Sherman's arrival I took him, with Generals Thomasand Smith and other officers, to the north side of the river, and showedthem the ground over which Sherman had to march, and pointed outgenerally what he was expected to do.  I, as well as the authorities inWashington, was still in a great state of anxiety for Burnside's safety.Burnside himself, I believe, was the only one who did not share in thisanxiety. Nothing could be done for him, however, until Sherman's troopswere up.  As soon, therefore, as the inspection was over, Shermanstarted for Bridgeport to hasten matters, rowing a boat himself, Ibelieve, from Kelly's Ferry.  Sherman had left Bridgeport the nightof the 14th, reached Chattanooga the evening of the 15th, made theabove-described inspection on the morning of the 16th, and started backthe same evening to hurry up his command, fully appreciating theimportance of time.His march was conducted with as much expedition as the roads and seasonwould admit of.  By the 20th he was himself at Brown's Ferry with thehead of column, but many of his troops were far behind, and one division(Ewing's) was at Trenton, sent that way to create the impression thatLookout was to be taken from the south.  Sherman received his orders atthe ferry, and was asked if he could not be ready for the assault thefollowing morning.  News had been received that the battle had beencommenced at Knoxville.  Burnside had been cut off from telegraphiccommunications.  The President, the Secretary of War, and GeneralHalleck, were in an agony of suspense.  My suspense was also great, butmore endurable, because I was where I could soon do something to relievethe situation.  It was impossible to get Sherman's troops up for thenext day.  I then asked him if they could not be got up to make theassault on the morning of the 22d, and ordered Thomas to move on thatdate.  But the elements were against us.  It rained all the 20th and21st. The river rose so rapidly that it was difficult to keep thepontoons in place.General Orlando B. Willcox, a division commander under Burnside, was atthis time occupying a position farther up the valley than Knoxville--about Maynardville--and was still in telegraphic communication with theNorth.  A dispatch was received from him saying that he was threatenedfrom the east.  The following was sent in reply:'If you can communicate with General Burnside, say to him that ourattack on Bragg will commence in the morning.  If successful, such amove will be made as I think will relieve East Tennessee, if he can holdout.  Longstreet passing through our lines to Kentucky need not causealarm.  He would find the country so bare that he would lose histransportation and artillery before reaching Kentucky, and would meetsuch a force before he got through, that he could not return.'Meantime, Sherman continued his crossing without intermission as fast ashis troops could be got up.  The crossing had to be effected in fullview of the enemy on the top of Lookout Mountain.  Once over, however,the troops soon disappeared behind the detached hill on the north side,and would not come to view again, either to watchmen on Lookout Mountainor Missionary Ridge, until they emerged between the hills to strike thebank of the river.  But when Sherman's advance reached a point oppositethe town of Chattanooga, Howard, who, it will be remembered, had beenconcealed behind the hills on the north side, took up his line of marchto join the troops on the south side.  His crossing was in full viewboth from Missionary Ridge and the top of Lookout, and the enemy ofcourse supposed these troops to be Sherman's.  This enabled Sherman toget to his assigned position without discovery.
ISFP	 XLIII.PREPARATIONS FOR BATTLE--THOMAS CARRIES THE FIRST LINE OF THE ENEMY--SHERMAN CARRIES MISSIONARY RIDGE--BATTLE OF LOOKOUT MOUNTAIN--GENERAL HOOKER'S FIGHT.On the 20th, when so much was occurring to discourage--rains falling soheavily as to delay the passage of troops over the river at Brown'sFerry and threatening the entire breaking of the bridge; news coming ofa battle raging at Knoxville; of Willcox being threatened by a forcefrom the east--a letter was received from Bragg which contained thesewords:  'As there may still be some non-combatants in Chattanooga, Ideem it proper to notify you that prudence would dictate their earlywithdrawal.' Of course, I understood that this was a device intended todeceive; but I did not know what the intended deception was.  On the22d, however, a deserter came in who informed me that Bragg was leavingour front, and on that day Buckner's division was sent to reinforceLongstreet at Knoxville, and another division started to follow but wasrecalled.  The object of Bragg's letter, no doubt, was in some way todetain me until Knoxville could be captured, and his troops there bereturned to Chattanooga.During the night of the 21st the rest of the pontoon boats, completed,one hundred and sixteen in all, were carried up to and placed in NorthChickamauga. The material for the roadway over these was deposited outof view of the enemy within a few hundred yards of the bank of theTennessee, where the north end of the bridge was to rest.Hearing nothing from Burnside, and hearing much of the distress inWashington on his account, I could no longer defer operations for hisrelief.  I determined, therefore, to do on the 23d, with the Army of theCumberland, what had been intended to be done on the 24th.The position occupied by the Army of the Cumberland had been made verystrong for defence during the months it had been besieged.  The line wasabout a mile from the town, and extended from Citico Creek, a smallstream running near the base of Missionary Ridge and emptying into theTennessee about two miles below the mouth of the South Chickamauga, onthe left, to Chattanooga Creek on the right.  All commanding points onthe line were well fortified and well equipped with artillery.  Theimportant elevations within the line had all been carefully fortifiedand supplied with a proper armament.  Among the elevations so fortifiedwas one to the east of the town, named Fort Wood.  It owed itsimportance chiefly to the fact that it lay between the town andMissionary Ridge, where most of the strength of the enemy was.  FortWood had in it twenty-two pieces of artillery, most of which would reachthe nearer points of the enemy's line.  On the morning of the 23dThomas, according to instructions, moved Granger's corps of twodivisions, Sheridan and T. J. Wood commanding, to the foot of Fort Wood,and formed them into line as if going on parade, Sheridan on the right,Wood to the left, extending to or near Citico Creek.  Palmer, commandingthe 14th corps, held that part of our line facing south and southwest.He supported Sheridan with one division (Baird's), while his otherdivision under Johnson remained in the trenches, under arms, ready to bemoved to any point. Howard's corps was moved in rear of the centre.  Thepicket lines were within a few hundred yards of each other.  At twoo'clock in the afternoon all were ready to advance.  By this time theclouds had lifted so that the enemy could see from his elevated positionall that was going on.  The signal for advance was given by a booming ofcannon from Fort Wood and other points on the line.  The rebel picketswere soon driven back upon the main guards, which occupied minor anddetached heights between the main ridge and our lines.  These too werecarried before halting, and before the enemy had time to reinforce theiradvance guards.  But it was not without loss on both sides. Thismovement secured to us a line fully a mile in advance of the one weoccupied in the morning, and the one which the enemy had occupied up tothis time.  The fortifications were rapidly turned to face the otherway.  During the following night they were made strong.  We lost in thispreliminary action about eleven hundred killed and wounded, while theenemy probably lost quite as heavily, including the prisoners that werecaptured. With the exception of the firing of artillery, kept up fromMissionary Ridge and Fort Wood until night closed in, this ended thefighting for the first day.The advantage was greatly on our side now, and if I could only have beenassured that Burnside could hold out ten days longer I should haverested more easily.  But we were doing the best we could for him and thecause.By the night of the 23d Sherman's command was in a position to move,though one division (Osterhaus's) had not yet crossed the river atBrown's Ferry.  The continuous rise in the Tennessee had rendered itimpossible to keep the bridge at that point in condition for troops tocross; but I was determined to move that night even without thisdivision.  Orders were sent to Osterhaus accordingly to report toHooker, if he could not cross by eight o'clock on the morning of the24th.  Because of the break in the bridge, Hooker's orders were againchanged, but this time only back to those first given to him.General W. F. Smith had been assigned to duty as Chief Engineer of theMilitary Division.  To him were given the general direction of movingtroops by the boats from North Chickamauga, laying the bridge after theyreached their position, and generally all the duties pertaining to hisoffice of chief engineer.  During the night General Morgan L. Smith'sdivision was marched to the point where the pontoons were, and thebrigade of Giles A. Smith was selected for the delicate duty of manningthe boats and surprising the enemy's pickets on the south bank of theriver.  During this night also General J. M. Brannan, chief ofartillery, moved forty pieces of artillery, belonging to the Army of theCumberland, and placed them on the north side of the river so as tocommand the ground opposite, to aid in protecting the approach to thepoint where the south end of the bridge was to rest.  He had to useSherman's artillery horses for this purpose, Thomas having none.At two o'clock in the morning, November 24th, Giles A. Smith pushed outfrom the North Chickamauga with his one hundred and sixteen boats, eachloaded with thirty brave and well-armed men.  The boats with theirprecious freight dropped down quietly with the current to avoidattracting the attention of any one who could convey information to theenemy, until arriving near the mouth of South Chickamauga. Here a fewboats were landed, the troops debarked, and a rush was made upon thepicket guard known to be at that point.  The guard were surprised, andtwenty of their number captured.  The remainder of the troops effected alanding at the point where the bridge was to start, with equally goodresults.  The work of ferrying over Sherman's command from the northside of the Tennessee was at once commenced, using the pontoons for thepurpose.  A steamer was also brought up from the town to assist.  Therest of M. L. Smith's division came first, then the division of John E.Smith.  The troops as they landed were put to work intrenching theirposition.  By daylight the two entire divisions were over, and wellcovered by the works they had built.The work of laying the bridge, on which to cross the artillery andcavalry, was now begun.  The ferrying over the infantry was continuedwith the steamer and the pontoons, taking the pontoons, however, as fastas they were wanted to put in their place in the bridge.  By a littlepast noon the bridge was completed, as well as one over the SouthChickamauga connecting the troops left on that side with their comradesbelow, and all the infantry and artillery were on the south bank of theTennessee.Sherman at once formed his troops for assault on Missionary Ridge.  Byone o'clock he started with M. L. Smith on his left, keeping nearly thecourse of Chickamauga River; J. E. Smith next to the right and a littleto the rear; and Ewing still farther to the right and also a little tothe rear of J. E. Smith's command, in column, ready to deploy to theright if an enemy should come from that direction.  A good skirmish linepreceded each of these columns.  Soon the foot of the hill was reached;the skirmishers pushed directly up, followed closely by their supports.By half-past three Sherman was in possession of the height withouthaving sustained much loss.  A brigade from each division was nowbrought up, and artillery was dragged to the top of the hill by hand.The enemy did not seem to be aware of this movement until the top of thehill was gained.  There had been a drizzling rain during the day, andthe clouds were so low that Lookout Mountain and the top of MissionaryRidge were obscured from the view of persons in the valley.  But now theenemy opened fire upon their assailants, and made several attempts withtheir skirmishers to drive them away, but without avail.  Later in theday a more determined attack was made, but this, too, failed, andSherman was left to fortify what he had gained.Sherman's cavalry took up its line of march soon after the bridge wascompleted, and by half-past three the whole of it was over both bridgesand on its way to strike the enemy's communications at ChickamaugaStation.  All of Sherman's command was now south of the Tennessee.During the afternoon General Giles A. Smith was severely wounded andcarried from the field.Thomas having done on the 23d what was expected of him on the 24th,there was nothing for him to do this day except to strengthen hisposition.  Howard, however, effected a crossing of Citico Creek and ajunction with Sherman, and was directed to report to him.  With two orthree regiments of his command he moved in the morning along the banksof the Tennessee, and reached the point where the bridge was being laid.He went out on the bridge as far as it was completed from the south end,and saw Sherman superintending the work from the north side and movinghimself south as fast as an additional boat was put in and the roadwayput upon it.  Howard reported to his new chief across the chasm betweenthem, which was now narrow and in a few minutes closed.While these operations were going on to the east of Chattanooga, Hookerwas engaged on the west.  He had three divisions: Osterhaus's, of the15th corps, Army of the Tennessee; Geary's, 12th corps, Army of thePotomac; and Cruft's, 14th corps, Army of the Cumberland.  Geary was onthe right at Wauhatchie, Cruft at the centre, and Osterhaus near Brown'sFerry.  These troops were all west of Lookout Creek.  The enemy had theeast bank of the creek strongly picketed and intrenched, and threebrigades of troops in the rear to reinforce them if attacked.  Thesebrigades occupied the summit of the mountain.  General Carter L.Stevenson was in command of the whole.  Why any troops, except artillerywith a small infantry guard, were kept on the mountain-top, I do notsee.  A hundred men could have held the summit--which is a palisade formore than thirty feet down--against the assault of any number of menfrom the position Hooker occupied.The side of Lookout Mountain confronting Hooker's command was rugged,heavily timbered, and full of chasms, making it difficult to advancewith troops, even in the absence of an opposing force.  Farther up, theground becomes more even and level, and was in cultivation.  On the eastside the slope is much more gradual, and a good wagon road, zigzaggingup it, connects the town of Chattanooga with the summit.Early on the morning of the 24th Hooker moved Geary's division,supported by a brigade of Cruft's, up Lookout Creek, to effect acrossing.  The remainder of Cruft's division was to seize the bridgeover the creek, near the crossing of the railroad. Osterhaus was to moveup to the bridge and cross it.  The bridge was seized by Gross's brigadeafter a slight skirmish with the pickets guarding it.  This attractedthe enemy so that Geary's movement farther up was not observed.  A heavymist obscured him from the view of the troops on the top of themountain.  He crossed the creek almost unobserved, and captured thepicket of over forty men on guard near by.  He then commenced ascendingthe mountain directly in his front.  By this time the enemy was seencoming down from their camps on the mountain slope, and filing intotheir rifle-pits to contest the crossing of the bridge.  By eleveno'clock the bridge was complete.  Osterhaus was up, and after some sharpskirmishing the enemy was driven away with considerable loss in killedand captured.While the operations at the bridge were progressing, Geary was pushingup the hill over great obstacles, resisted by the enemy directly in hisfront, and in face of the guns on top of the mountain.  The enemy,seeing their left flank and rear menaced, gave way, and were followed byCruft and Osterhaus.  Soon these were up abreast of Geary, and the wholecommand pushed up the hill, driving the enemy in advance.  By noon Gearyhad gained the open ground on the north slope of the mountain, with hisright close up to the base of the upper palisade, but there were strongfortifications in his front.  The rest of the command coming up, a linewas formed from the base of the upper palisade to the mouth ofChattanooga Creek.Thomas and I were on the top of Orchard Knob.  Hooker's advance now madeour line a continuous one.  It was in full view, extending from theTennessee River, where Sherman had crossed, up Chickamauga River to thebase of Mission Ridge, over the top of the north end of the ridge toChattanooga Valley, then along parallel to the ridge a mile or more,across the valley to the mouth of Chattanooga Creek, thence up the slopeof Lookout Mountain to the foot of the upper palisade.  The day washazy, so that Hooker's operations were not visible to us except atmoments when the clouds would rise.  But the sound of his artillery andmusketry was heard incessantly.  The enemy on his front was partiallyfortified, but was soon driven out of his works.  During the afternoonthe clouds, which had so obscured the top of Lookout all day as to hidewhatever was going on from the view of those below, settled down andmade it so dark where Hooker was as to stop operations for the time.  Atfour o'clock Hooker reported his position as impregnable.  By a littleafter five direct communication was established, and a brigade of troopswas sent from Chattanooga to reinforce him.  These troops had to crossChattanooga Creek and met with some opposition, but soon overcame it,and by night the commander, General Carlin, reported to Hooker and wasassigned to his left.  I now telegraphed to Washington:  'The fightto-day progressed favorably.  Sherman carried the end of MissionaryRidge, and his right is now at the tunnel, and his left at ChickamaugaCreek. Troops from Lookout Valley carried the point of the mountain, andnow hold the eastern slope and a point high up.  Hooker reports twothousand prisoners taken, besides which a small number have fallen intoour hands from Missionary Ridge.'  The next day the President replied:'Your dispatches as to fighting on Monday and Tuesday are here.  Welldone. Many thanks to all.  Remember Burnside.'  And Halleck alsotelegraphed: 'I congratulate you on the success thus far of your plans.I fear that Burnside is hard pushed, and that any further delay mayprove fatal.  I know you will do all in your power to relieve him.'The division of Jefferson C. Davis, Army of the Cumberland, had beensent to the North Chickamauga to guard the pontoons as they weredeposited in the river, and to prevent all ingress or egress ofcitizens.  On the night of the 24th his division, having crossed withSherman, occupied our extreme left from the upper bridge over the plainto the north base of Missionary Ridge. Firing continued to a late hourin the night, but it was not connected with an assault at any point.
ISFP	 XLIV.BATTLE OF CHATTANOOGA--A GALLANT CHARGE--COMPLETE ROUT OF THE ENEMY--PURSUIT OF THE CONFEDERATES--GENERAL BRAGG--REMARKS ON CHATTANOOGA.At twelve o'clock at night, when all was quiet, I began to give ordersfor the next day, and sent a dispatch to Willcox to encourage Burnside.Sherman was directed to attack at daylight.  Hooker was ordered to moveat the same hour, and endeavor to intercept the enemy's retreat if hestill remained; if he had gone, then to move directly to Rossville andoperate against the left and rear of the force on Missionary Ridge.Thomas was not to move until Hooker had reached Missionary Ridge.  As Iwas with him on Orchard Knob, he would not move without further ordersfrom me.The morning of the 25th opened clear and bright, and the whole field wasin full view from the top of Orchard Knob.  It remained so all day.Bragg's headquarters were in full view, and officers--presumably staffofficers--could be seen coming and going constantly.The point of ground which Sherman had carried on the 24th was almostdisconnected from the main ridge occupied by the enemy. A low pass, overwhich there is a wagon road crossing the hill, and near which there is arailroad tunnel, intervenes between the two hills.  The problem now wasto get to the main ridge. The enemy was fortified on the point; and backfarther, where the ground was still higher, was a second fortificationcommanding the first.  Sherman was out as soon as it was light enough tosee, and by sunrise his command was in motion.  Three brigades held thehill already gained.  Morgan L. Smith moved along the east base ofMissionary Ridge; Loomis along the west base, supported by two brigadesof John E. Smith's division; and Corse with his brigade was between thetwo, moving directly towards the hill to be captured.  The ridge issteep and heavily wooded on the east side, where M. L. Smith's troopswere advancing, but cleared and with a more gentle slope on the westside.  The troops advanced rapidly and carried the extreme end of therebel works.  Morgan L. Smith advanced to a point which cut the enemyoff from the railroad bridge and the means of bringing up supplies byrail from Chickamauga Station, where the main depot was located.  Theenemy made brave and strenuous efforts to drive our troops from theposition we had gained, but without success.  The contest lasted for twohours.  Corse, a brave and efficient commander, was badly wounded inthis assault.  Sherman now threatened both Bragg's flank and his stores,and made it necessary for him to weaken other points of his line tostrengthen his right.  From the position I occupied I could see columnafter column of Bragg's forces moving against Sherman.  EveryConfederate gun that could be brought to bear upon the Union forces wasconcentrated upon him.  J. E. Smith, with two brigades, charged up thewest side of the ridge to the support of Corse's command, over openground and in the face of a heavy fire of both artillery and musketry,and reached the very parapet of the enemy.  He lay here for a time, butthe enemy coming with a heavy force upon his right flank, he wascompelled to fall back, followed by the foe.  A few hundred yardsbrought Smith's troops into a wood, where they were speedily reformed,when they charged and drove the attacking party back to hisintrenchments.Seeing the advance, repulse, and second advance of J. E. Smith from theposition I occupied, I directed Thomas to send a division to reinforcehim.  Baird's division was accordingly sent from the right of OrchardKnob.  It had to march a considerable distance directly under the eye ofthe enemy to reach its position.  Bragg at once commenced massing in thesame direction.  This was what I wanted.  But it had now got to be latein the afternoon, and I had expected before this to see Hooker crossingthe ridge in the neighborhood of Rossville and compelling Bragg to massin that direction also.The enemy had evacuated Lookout Mountain during the night, as I expectedhe would.  In crossing the valley he burned the bridge over ChattanoogaCreek, and did all he could to obstruct the roads behind him.  Hookerwas off bright and early, with no obstructions in his front but distanceand the destruction above named.  He was detained four hours crossingChattanooga Creek, and thus was lost the immediate advantage I expectedfrom his forces.  His reaching Bragg's flank and extending across it wasto be the signal for Thomas's assault of the ridge.  But Sherman'scondition was getting so critical that the assault for his relief couldnot be delayed any longer.Sheridan's and Wood's divisions had been lying under arms from earlymorning, ready to move the instant the signal was given. I now directedThomas to order the charge at once (*16). I watched eagerly to see theeffect, and became impatient at last that there was no indication of anycharge being made.  The centre of the line which was to make the chargewas near where Thomas and I stood, but concealed from view by anintervening forest.  Turning to Thomas to inquire what caused the delay,I was surprised to see Thomas J. Wood, one of the division commanderswho was to make the charge, standing talking to him.  I spoke to GeneralWood, asking him why he did not charge as ordered an hour before.  Hereplied very promptly that this was the first he had heard of it, butthat he had been ready all day to move at a moment's notice.  I told himto make the charge at once.  He was off in a moment, and in anincredibly short time loud cheering was heard, and he and Sheridan weredriving the enemy's advance before them towards Missionary Ridge.  TheConfederates were strongly intrenched on the crest of the ridge in frontof us, and had a second line half-way down and another at the base. Ourmen drove the troops in front of the lower line of rifle-pits sorapidly, and followed them so closely, that rebel and Union troops wentover the first line of works almost at the same time.  Many rebels werecaptured and sent to the rear under the fire of their own friends higherup the hill.  Those that were not captured retreated, and were pursued.The retreating hordes being between friends and pursuers caused theenemy to fire high to avoid killing their own men.  In fact, on thatoccasion the Union soldier nearest the enemy was in the safest position.Without awaiting further orders or stopping to reform, on our troopswent to the second line of works; over that and on for the crest--thuseffectually carrying out my orders of the 18th for the battle and of the24th (*17) for this charge.I watched their progress with intense interest.  The fire along therebel line was terrific.  Cannon and musket balls filled the air:  butthe damage done was in small proportion to the ammunition expended.  Thepursuit continued until the crest was reached, and soon our men wereseen climbing over the Confederate barriers at different points in frontof both Sheridan's and Wood's divisions.  The retreat of the enemy alongmost of his line was precipitate and the panic so great that Bragg andhis officers lost all control over their men.  Many were captured, andthousands threw away their arms in their flight.Sheridan pushed forward until he reached the Chickamauga River at apoint above where the enemy crossed.  He met some resistance from troopsoccupying a second hill in rear of Missionary Ridge, probably to coverthe retreat of the main body and of the artillery and trains.  It wasnow getting dark, but Sheridan, without halting on that account pushedhis men forward up this second hill slowly and without attracting theattention of the men placed to defend it, while he detached to the rightand left to surround the position.  The enemy discovered the movementbefore these dispositions were complete, and beat a hasty retreat,leaving artillery, wagon trains, and many prisoners in our hands.  ToSheridan's prompt movement the Army of the Cumberland, and the nation,are indebted for the bulk of the capture of prisoners, artillery, andsmall-arms that day. Except for his prompt pursuit, so much in this waywould not have been accomplished.While the advance up Mission Ridge was going forward, General Thomaswith staff, General Gordon Granger, commander of the corps making theassault, and myself and staff occupied Orchard Knob, from which theentire field could be observed.  The moment the troops were seen goingover the last line of rebel defences, I ordered Granger to join hiscommand, and mounting my horse I rode to the front.  General Thomas leftabout the same time. Sheridan on the extreme right was already inpursuit of the enemy east of the ridge.  Wood, who commanded thedivision to the left of Sheridan, accompanied his men on horseback inthe charge, but did not join Sheridan in the pursuit.  To the left, inBaird's front where Bragg's troops had massed against Sherman, theresistance was more stubborn and the contest lasted longer.  I orderedGranger to follow the enemy with Wood's division, but he was so muchexcited, and kept up such a roar of musketry in the direction the enemyhad taken, that by the time I could stop the firing the enemy had gotwell out of the way.  The enemy confronting Sherman, now seeingeverything to their left giving way, fled also.  Sherman, however, wasnot aware of the extent of our success until after nightfall, when hereceived orders to pursue at daylight in the morning.As soon as Sherman discovered that the enemy had left his front hedirected his reserves, Davis's division of the Army of the Cumberland,to push over the pontoon-bridge at the mouth of the Chickamauga, and tomove forward to Chickamauga Station.  He ordered Howard to move up thestream some two miles to where there was an old bridge, repair it duringthe night, and follow Davis at four o'clock in the morning.  Morgan L.Smith was ordered to reconnoitre the tunnel to see if that was stillheld.  Nothing was found there but dead bodies of men of both armies.The rest of Sherman's command was directed to follow Howard at daylightin the morning to get on to the railroad towards Graysville.Hooker, as stated, was detained at Chattanooga Creek by the destructionof the bridge at that point.  He got his troops over, with the exceptionof the artillery, by fording the stream at a little after three o'clock.Leaving his artillery to follow when the bridge should be reconstructed,he pushed on with the remainder of his command.  At Rossville he cameupon the flank of a division of the enemy, which soon commenced aretreat along the ridge.  This threw them on Palmer.  They could makebut little resistance in the position they were caught in, and as manyof them as could do so escaped.  Many, however, were captured.  Hooker'sposition during the night of the 25th was near Rossville, extending eastof the ridge.  Palmer was on his left, on the road to Graysville.During the night I telegraphed to Willcox that Bragg had been defeated,and that immediate relief would be sent to Burnside if he could holdout; to Halleck I sent an announcement of our victory, and informed himthat forces would be sent up the valley to relieve Burnside.Before the battle of Chattanooga opened I had taken measures for therelief of Burnside the moment the way should be clear. Thomas wasdirected to have the little steamer that had been built at Chattanoogaloaded to its capacity with rations and ammunition.  Granger's corps wasto move by the south bank of the Tennessee River to the mouth of theHolston, and up that to Knoxville accompanied by the boat.  In additionto the supplies transported by boat, the men were to carry forty roundsof ammunition in their cartridge-boxes, and four days' rations inhaversacks.In the battle of Chattanooga, troops from the Army of the Potomac, fromthe Army of the Tennessee, and from the Army of the Cumberlandparticipated.  In fact, the accidents growing out of the heavy rains andthe sudden rise in the Tennessee River so mingled the troops that theorganizations were not kept together, under their respective commanders,during the battle.  Hooker, on the right, had Geary's division of the12th corps, Army of the Potomac; Osterhaus's division of the 15th corps,Army of the Tennessee; and Cruft's division of the Army of theCumberland.  Sherman had three divisions of his own army, Howard's corpsfrom the Army of the Potomac, and Jefferson C. Davis's division of theArmy of the Cumberland.  There was no jealousy--hardly rivalry.  Indeed,I doubt whether officers or men took any note at the time of the fact ofthis intermingling of commands.  All saw a defiant foe surrounding them,and took it for granted that every move was intended to dislodge him,and it made no difference where the troops came from so that the end wasaccomplished.The victory at Chattanooga was won against great odds, considering theadvantage the enemy had of position, and was accomplished more easilythan was expected by reason of Bragg's making several grave mistakes:first, in sending away his ablest corps commander with over twentythousand troops; second, in sending away a division of troops on the eveof battle; third, in placing so much of a force on the plain in front ofhis impregnable position.It was known that Mr. Jefferson Davis had visited Bragg on MissionaryRidge a short time before my reaching Chattanooga. It was reported andbelieved that he had come out to reconcile a serious difference betweenBragg and Longstreet, and finding this difficult to do, planned thecampaign against Knoxville, to be conducted by the latter general.  Ihad known both Bragg and Longstreet before the war, the latter verywell.  We had been three years at West Point together, and, after mygraduation, for a time in the same regiment.  Then we served together inthe Mexican War.  I had known Bragg in Mexico, and met him occasionallysubsequently.  I could well understand how there might be anirreconcilable difference between them.Bragg was a remarkably intelligent and well-informed man, professionallyand otherwise.  He was also thoroughly upright. But he was possessed ofan irascible temper, and was naturally disputatious.  A man of thehighest moral character and the most correct habits, yet in the old armyhe was in frequent trouble. As a subordinate he was always on thelookout to catch his commanding officer infringing his prerogatives; asa post commander he was equally vigilant to detect the slightestneglect, even of the most trivial order.I have heard in the old army an anecdote very characteristic of Bragg.On one occasion, when stationed at a post of several companies commandedby a field officer, he was himself commanding one of the companies andat the same time acting as post quartermaster and commissary.  He wasfirst lieutenant at the time, but his captain was detached on otherduty.  As commander of the company he made a requisition upon thequartermaster--himself--for something he wanted.  As quartermaster hedeclined to fill the requisition, and endorsed on the back of it hisreasons for so doing.  As company commander he responded to this, urgingthat his requisition called for nothing but what he was entitled to, andthat it was the duty of the quartermaster to fill it.  As quartermasterhe still persisted that he was right.  In this condition of affairsBragg referred the whole matter to the commanding officer of the post.The latter, when he saw the nature of the matter referred, exclaimed:'My God, Mr. Bragg, you have quarrelled with every officer in the army,and now you are quarrelling with yourself!'Longstreet was an entirely different man.  He was brave, honest,intelligent, a very capable soldier, subordinate to his superiors, justand kind to his subordinates, but jealous of his own rights, which hehad the courage to maintain.  He was never on the lookout to detect aslight, but saw one as soon as anybody when intentionally given.It may be that Longstreet was not sent to Knoxville for the reasonstated, but because Mr. Davis had an exalted opinion of his own militarygenius, and thought he saw a chance of 'killing two birds with onestone.'  On several occasions during the war he came to the relief ofthe Union army by means of his SUPERIOR MILITARY GENIUS.I speak advisedly when I saw Mr. Davis prided himself on his militarycapacity.  He says so himself, virtually, in his answer to the notice ofhis nomination to the Confederate presidency. Some of his generals havesaid so in their writings since the downfall of the Confederacy.My recollection is that my first orders for the battle of Chattanoogawere as fought.  Sherman was to get on Missionary Ridge, as he did;Hooker to cross the north end of Lookout Mountain, as he did, sweepacross Chattanooga Valley and get across the south end of the ridge nearRossville.  When Hooker had secured that position the Army of theCumberland was to assault in the centre.  Before Sherman arrived,however, the order was so changed as that Hooker was directed to come toChattanooga by the north bank of the Tennessee River.  The waters in theriver, owing to heavy rains, rose so fast that the bridge at Brown'sFerry could not be maintained in a condition to be used in crossingtroops upon it.  For this reason Hooker's orders were changed bytelegraph back to what they were originally.------NOTE.--From this point on this volume was written (with the exception ofthe campaign in the Wilderness, which had been previously written) byGeneral Grant, after his great illness in April, and the presentarrangement of the subject-matter was made by him between the 10th and18th of July, 1885.
ISFP	 XLV.THE RELIEF OF KNOXVILLE--HEADQUARTERS MOVED TO NASHVILLE--VISITINGKNOXVILLE-CIPHER CIPHER DISPATCHES--WITHHOLDING ORDERS.Chattanooga now being secure to the National troops beyond any doubt, Iimmediately turned my attention to relieving Knoxville, about thesituation of which the President, in particular, was very anxious.Prior to the battles, I had made preparations for sending troops to therelief of Burnside at the very earliest moment after securingChattanooga. We had there two little steamers which had been built andfitted up from the remains of old boats and put in condition to run.General Thomas was directed to have one of these boats loaded withrations and ammunition and move up the Tennessee River to the mouth ofthe Holston, keeping the boat all the time abreast of the troops.General Granger, with the 4th corps reinforced to make twenty thousandmen, was to start the moment Missionary Ridge was carried, and under nocircumstances were the troops to return to their old camps.  With theprovisions carried, and the little that could be got in the country, itwas supposed he could hold out until Longstreet was driven away, afterwhich event East Tennessee would furnish abundance of food forBurnside's army and his own also.While following the enemy on the 26th, and again on the morning of the27th, part of the time by the road to Ringgold, I directed Thomas,verbally, not to start Granger until he received further orders from me;advising him that I was going to the front to more fully see thesituation.  I was not right sure but that Bragg's troops might be overtheir stampede by the time they reached Dalton.  In that case Braggmight think it well to take the road back to Cleveland, move thencetowards Knoxville, and, uniting with Longstreet, make a sudden dash uponBurnside.When I arrived at Ringgold, however, on the 27th, I saw that the retreatwas most earnest.  The enemy had been throwing away guns, caissons andsmall-arms, abandoning provisions, and, altogether, seemed to be movinglike a disorganized mob, with the exception of Cleburne's division,which was acting as rear-guard to cover the retreat.When Hooker moved from Rossville toward Ringgold Palmer's division tookthe road to Graysville, and Sherman moved by the way of ChickamaugaStation toward the same point.  As soon as I saw the situation atRinggold I sent a staff officer back to Chattanooga to advise Thomas ofthe condition of affairs, and direct him by my orders to start Grangerat once.  Feeling now that the troops were already on the march for therelief of Burnside I was in no hurry to get back, but stayed at Ringgoldthrough the day to prepare for the return of our troops.Ringgold is in a valley in the mountains, situated between EastChickamauga Creek and Taylor's Ridge, and about twenty miles south-eastfrom Chattanooga. I arrived just as the artillery that Hooker had leftbehind at Chattanooga Creek got up.  His men were attacking Cleburne'sdivision, which had taken a strong position in the adjacent hills so asto cover the retreat of the Confederate army through a narrow gorgewhich presents itself at that point.  Just beyond the gorge the valleyis narrow, and the creek so tortuous that it has to be crossed a greatmany times in the course of the first mile.  This attack wasunfortunate, and cost us some men unnecessarily.  Hooker captured,however, 3 pieces of artillery and 230 prisoners, and 130 rebel deadwere left upon the field.I directed General Hooker to collect the flour and wheat in theneighboring mills for the use of the troops, and then to destroy themills and all other property that could be of use to the enemy, but notto make any wanton destruction.At this point Sherman came up, having reached Graysville with histroops, where he found Palmer had preceded him.  Palmer had picked upmany prisoners and much abandoned property on the route.  I went back inthe evening to Graysville with Sherman, remained there over night anddid not return to Chattanooga until the following night, the 29th.  Ithen found that Thomas had not yet started Granger, thus having lost afull day which I deemed of so much importance in determining the fate ofKnoxville.  Thomas and Granger were aware that on the 23d of the monthBurnside had telegraphed that his supplies would last for ten or twelvedays and during that time he could hold out against Longstreet, but ifnot relieved within the time indicated he would be obliged to surrenderor attempt to retreat.  To effect a retreat would have been animpossibility.  He was already very low in ammunition, and with an armypursuing he would not have been able to gather supplies.Finding that Granger had not only not started but was very reluctant togo, he having decided for himself that it was a very bad move to make, Isent word to General Sherman of the situation and directed him to marchto the relief of Knoxville.  I also gave him the problem that we had tosolve--that Burnside had now but four to six days supplies left, andthat he must be relieved within that time.Sherman, fortunately, had not started on his return from Graysville,having sent out detachments on the railroad which runs from Dalton toCleveland and Knoxville to thoroughly destroy that road, and thesetroops had not yet returned to camp.  I was very loath to send Sherman,because his men needed rest after their long march from Memphis and hardfighting at Chattanooga. But I had become satisfied that Burnside wouldnot be rescued if his relief depended upon General Granger's movements.Sherman had left his camp on the north side of the Tennessee River, nearChattanooga, on the night of the 23d, the men having two days' cookedrations in their haversacks.  Expecting to be back in their tents bythat time and to be engaged in battle while out, they took with themneither overcoats nor blankets. The weather was already cold, and atnight they must have suffered more or less.  The two days' rations hadalready lasted them five days; and they were now to go through a countrywhich had been run over so much by Confederate troops that there was butlittle probability of finding much food.  They did, however, succeed incapturing some flour.  They also found a good deal of bran in some ofthe mills, which the men made up into bread; and in this and other waysthey eked out an existence until they could reach Knoxville.I was so very anxious that Burnside should get news of the steps beingtaken for his relief, and thus induce him to hold out a little longer ifit became necessary, that I determined to send a message to him.  Itherefore sent a member of my staff, Colonel J. H. Wilson, to get intoKnoxville if he could report to Burnside the situation fully, and givehim all the encouragement possible.  Mr. Charles A. Dana was atChattanooga during the battle, and had been there even before I assumedcommand.  Mr. Dana volunteered to accompany Colonel Wilson, and didaccompany him.  I put the information of what was being done for therelief of Knoxville into writing, and directed that in some way or otherit must be secretly managed so as to have a copy of this fall into thehands of General Longstreet.  They made the trip safely; GeneralLongstreet did learn of Sherman's coming in advance of his reachingthere, and Burnside was prepared to hold out even for a longer time ifit had been necessary.Burnside had stretched a boom across the Holston River to catch scowsand flats as they floated down.  On these, by previous arrangements withthe loyal people of East Tennessee, were placed flour and corn, withforage and provisions generally, and were thus secured for the use ofthe Union troops.  They also drove cattle into Knoxville by the eastside, which was not covered by the enemy; so that when relief arrivedBurnside had more provisions on hand than when he had last reported.Our total loss (not including Burnside's) in all these engagementsamounted to 757 killed, 4,529 wounded and 330 missing.  We captured6,142 prisoners--about 50 per cent. more than the enemy reported fortheir total loss--40 pieces of artillery, 69 artillery carriages andcaissons and over 7,000 stands of small-arms.  The enemy's loss in armswas probably much greater than here reported, because we picked up agreat many that were found abandoned.I had at Chattanooga, in round numbers, about 60,000 men.  Bragg hadabout half this number, but his position was supposed to be impregnable.It was his own fault that he did not have more men present.  He had sentLongstreet away with his corps swelled by reinforcements up to overtwenty thousand men, thus reducing his own force more than one-third anddepriving himself of the presence of the ablest general of his command.He did this, too, after our troops had opened a line of communication byway of Brown's and Kelly's ferries with Bridgeport, thus securing fullrations and supplies of every kind; and also when he knew reinforcementswere coming to me.  Knoxville was of no earthly use to him whileChattanooga was in our hands.  If he should capture Chattanooga,Knoxville with its garrison would have fallen into his hands without astruggle.  I have never been able to see the wisdom of this move.Then, too, after Sherman had arrived, and when Bragg knew that he was onthe north side of the Tennessee River, he sent Buckner's division toreinforce Longstreet.  He also started another division a day later, butour attack having commenced before it reached Knoxville Bragg ordered itback.  It had got so far, however, that it could not return toChattanooga in time to be of service there.  It is possible this latterblunder may have been made by Bragg having become confused as to whatwas going on on our side.  Sherman had, as already stated, crossed tothe north side of the Tennessee River at Brown's Ferry, in full view ofBragg's troops from Lookout Mountain, a few days before the attack.They then disappeared behind foot hills, and did not come to the view ofthe troops on Missionary Ridge until they met their assault.  Bragg knewit was Sherman's troops that had crossed, and, they being so long out ofview, may have supposed that they had gone up the north bank of theTennessee River to the relief of Knoxville and that Longstreet wastherefore in danger.  But the first great blunder, detaching Longstreet,cannot be accounted for in any way I know of.  If he had capturedChattanooga, East Tennessee would have fallen without a struggle.  Itwould have been a victory for us to have got our army away fromChattanooga safely.  It was a manifold greater victory to drive away thebesieging army; a still greater one to defeat that army in his chosenground and nearly annihilate it.The probabilities are that our loss in killed was the heavier, as wewere the attacking party.  The enemy reported his loss in killed at 361:but as he reported his missing at 4,146, while we held over 6,000 ofthem as prisoners, and there must have been hundreds if not thousandswho deserted, but little reliance can be placed on this report.  Therewas certainly great dissatisfaction with Bragg on the part of thesoldiers for his harsh treatment of them, and a disposition to get awayif they could.  Then, too, Chattanooga, following in the same half yearwith Gettysburg in the East and Vicksburg in the West, there was muchthe same feeling in the South at this time that there had been in theNorth the fall and winter before.  If the same license had been allowedthe people and press in the South that was allowed in the North,Chattanooga would probably have been the last battle fought for thepreservation of the Union.General William F. Smith's services in these battles had been such thatI thought him eminently entitled to promotion.  I was aware that he hadpreviously been named by the President for promotion to the grade ofmajor-general, but that the Senate had rejected the nomination.  I wasnot aware of the reasons for this course, and therefore stronglyrecommended him for a major-generalcy.  My recommendation was heeded andthe appointment made.Upon the raising of the siege of Knoxville I, of course, informed theauthorities at Washington--the President and Secretary of War--of thefact, which caused great rejoicing there.  The President especially wasrejoiced that Knoxville had been relieved (*18) without furtherbloodshed.  The safety of Burnside's army and the loyal people of EastTennessee had been the subject of much anxiety to the President forseveral months, during which time he was doing all he could to relievethe situation; sending a new commander (*19) with a few thousand troopsby the way of Cumberland Gap, and telegraphing me daily, almost hourly,to 'remember Burnside,' 'do something for Burnside,' and other appealsof like tenor.  He saw no escape for East Tennessee until after ourvictory at Chattanooga. Even then he was afraid that Burnside might beout of ammunition, in a starving condition, or overpowered:  and hisanxiety was still intense until he heard that Longstreet had been drivenfrom the field.Burnside followed Longstreet only to Strawberry Plains, some twentymiles or more east, and then stopped, believing that Longstreet wouldleave the State.  The latter did not do so, however, but stopped only ashort distance farther on and subsisted his army for the entire winteroff East Tennessee. Foster now relieved Burnside.  Sherman madedisposition of his troops along the Tennessee River in accordance withinstructions.  I left Thomas in command at Chattanooga, and, about the20th of December, moved my headquarters to Nashville, Tennessee.Nashville was the most central point from which to communicate with myentire military division, and also with the authorities at Washington.While remaining at Chattanooga I was liable to have my telegraphiccommunications cut so as to throw me out of communication with both mycommand and Washington.Nothing occurred at Nashville worthy of mention during the winter, (*20)so I set myself to the task of having troops in positions from whichthey could move to advantage, and in collecting all necessary suppliesso as to be ready to claim a due share of the enemy's attention upon theappearance of the first good weather in the spring.  I expected toretain the command I then had, and prepared myself for the campaignagainst Atlanta. I also had great hopes of having a campaign madeagainst Mobile from the Gulf.  I expected after Atlanta fell to occupythat place permanently, and to cut off Lee's army from the West by wayof the road running through Augusta to Atlanta and thence south-west.  Iwas preparing to hold Atlanta with a small garrison, and it was myexpectation to push through to Mobile if that city was in ourpossession:  if not, to Savannah; and in this manner to get possessionof the only east and west railroad that would then be left to the enemy.But the spring campaign against Mobile was not made.The Army of the Ohio had been getting supplies over Cumberland Gap untiltheir animals had nearly all starved.  I now determined to go myself tosee if there was any possible chance of using that route in the spring,and if not to abandon it. Accordingly I left Nashville in the latterpart of December by rail for Chattanooga. From Chattanooga I took one ofthe little steamers previously spoken of as having been built there,and, putting my horses aboard, went up to the junction of the Clinchwith the Tennessee.  From that point the railroad had been repaired upto Knoxville and out east to Strawberry Plains.  I went by railtherefore to Knoxville, where I remained for several days.  General JohnG. Foster was then commanding the Department of the Ohio.  It was anintensely cold winter, the thermometer being down as low as zero everymorning for more than a week while I was at Knoxville and on my way fromthere on horseback to Lexington, Kentucky, the first point where I couldreach rail to carry me back to my headquarters at Nashville.The road over Cumberland Gap, and back of it, was strewn with debris ofbroken wagons and dead animals, much as I had found it on my first tripto Chattanooga over Waldron's Ridge.  The road had been cut up to asgreat a depth as clay could be by mules and wagons, and in thatcondition frozen; so that the ride of six days from Strawberry Plains toLexington over these holes and knobs in the road was a very cheerlessone, and very disagreeable.I found a great many people at home along that route, both in Tennesseeand Kentucky, and, almost universally, intensely loyal.  They wouldcollect in little places where we would stop of evenings, to see me,generally hearing of my approach before we arrived.  The peoplenaturally expected to see the commanding general the oldest person inthe party.  I was then forty-one years of age, while my medical directorwas gray-haired and probably twelve or more years my senior.  The crowdswould generally swarm around him, and thus give me an opportunity ofquietly dismounting and getting into the house.  It also gave me anopportunity of hearing passing remarks from one spectator to anotherabout their general.  Those remarks were apt to be more complimentary tothe cause than to the appearance of the supposed general, owing to hisbeing muffled up, and also owing to the travel-worn condition we wereall in after a hard day's ride.  I was back in Nashville by the 13th ofJanuary, 1864.When I started on this trip it was necessary for me to have some personalong who could turn dispatches into cipher, and who could also read thecipher dispatches which I was liable to receive daily and almost hourly.Under the rules of the War Department at that time, Mr. Stanton hadtaken entire control of the matter of regulating the telegraph anddetermining how it should be used, and of saying who, and who alone,should have the ciphers.  The operators possessed of the ciphers, aswell as the ciphers used, were practically independent of the commanderswhom they were serving immediately under, and had to report to the WarDepartment through General Stager all the dispatches which they receivedor forwarded.I was obliged to leave the telegraphic operator back at Nashville,because that was the point at which all dispatches to me would come, tobe forwarded from there.  As I have said, it was necessary for me alsoto have an operator during this inspection who had possession of thiscipher to enable me to telegraph to my division and to the WarDepartment without my dispatches being read by all the operators alongthe line of wires over which they were transmitted.  Accordingly Iordered the cipher operator to turn over the key to Captain Cyrus B.Comstock, of the Corps of Engineers, whom I had selected as a wise anddiscreet man who certainly could be trusted with the cipher if theoperator at my headquarters could.The operator refused point blank to turn over the key to CaptainComstock as directed by me, stating that his orders from the WarDepartment were not to give it to anybody--the commanding general or anyone else.  I told him I would see whether he would or not.  He said thatif he did he would be punished.  I told him if he did not he mostcertainly would be punished. Finally, seeing that punishment was certainif he refused longer to obey my order, and being somewhat remote (evenif he was not protected altogether from the consequences of hisdisobedience to his orders) from the War Department, he yielded.  When Ireturned from Knoxville I found quite a commotion.  The operator hadbeen reprimanded very severely and ordered to be relieved.  I informedthe Secretary of War, or his assistant secretary in charge of thetelegraph, Stager, that the man could not be relieved, for he had onlyobeyed my orders.  It was absolutely necessary for me to have thecipher, and the man would most certainly have been punished if he hadnot delivered it; that they would have to punish me if they punishedanybody, or words to that effect.This was about the only thing approaching a disagreeable differencebetween the Secretary of War and myself that occurred until the war wasover, when we had another little spat.  Owing to his natural dispositionto assume all power and control in all matters that he had anythingwhatever to do with, he boldly took command of the armies, and, whileissuing no orders on the subject, prohibited any order from me going outof the adjutant-general's office until he had approved it.  This wasdone by directing the adjutant-general to hold any orders that came fromme to be issued from the adjutant-general's office until he had examinedthem and given his approval.  He never disturbed himself, either, inexamining my orders until it was entirely convenient for him; so thatorders which I had prepared would often lie there three or four daysbefore he would sanction them.  I remonstrated against this in writing,and the Secretary apologetically restored me to my rightful position ofGeneral-in-Chief of the Army.  But he soon lapsed again and took controlmuch as before.After the relief of Knoxville Sherman had proposed to Burnside that heshould go with him to drive Longstreet out of Tennessee; but Burnsideassured him that with the troops which had been brought by Granger, andwhich were to be left, he would be amply prepared to dispose ofLongstreet without availing himself of this offer.  As before statedSherman's command had left their camps north of the Tennessee, nearChattanooga, with two days' rations in their haversacks, without coatsor blankets, and without many wagons, expecting to return to their campsby the end of that time.  The weather was now cold and they weresuffering, but still they were ready to make the further sacrifice, hadit been required, for the good of the cause which had brought them intoservice.  Sherman, having accomplished the object for which he was sent,marched back leisurely to his old camp on the Tennessee River.
ISFP	 XLVI.OPERATIONS IN MISSISSIPPI--LONGSTREET IN EAST TENNESSEE--COMMISSIONEDLIEUTENANT-GENERAL--COMMANDING THE ARMIES OF THE UNITED STATES--FIRSTINTERVIEW WITH PRESIDENT LINCOLN.Soon after his return from Knoxville I ordered Sherman to distribute hisforces from Stevenson to Decatur and thence north to Nashville; Shermansuggested that he be permitted to go back to Mississippi, to the limitsof his own department and where most of his army still remained, for thepurpose of clearing out what Confederates might still be left on theeast bank of the Mississippi River to impede its navigation by ourboats.  He expected also to have the co-operation of Banks to do thesame thing on the west shore.  Of course I approved heartily.About the 10th of January Sherman was back in Memphis, where Hurlbutcommanded, and got together his Memphis men, or ordered them collectedand sent to Vicksburg.  He then went to Vicksburg and out to whereMcPherson was in command, and had him organize his surplus troops so asto give him about 20,000 men in all.Sherman knew that General (Bishop) Polk was occupying Meridian with hisheadquarters, and had two divisions of infantry with a considerableforce of cavalry scattered west of him.  He determined, therefore, tomove directly upon Meridian.I had sent some 2,500 cavalry under General Sooy Smith to Sherman'sdepartment, and they had mostly arrived before Sherman got to Memphis.Hurlbut had 7,000 cavalry, and Sherman ordered him to reinforce Smith soas to give the latter a force of about 7,000 with which to go againstForrest, who was then known to be south-east from Memphis.  Smith wasordered to move about the 1st of February.While Sherman was waiting at Vicksburg for the arrival of Hurlbut withhis surplus men, he sent out scouts to ascertain the position andstrength of the enemy and to bring back all the information they couldgather.  When these scouts returned it was through them that he got theinformation of General Polk's being at Meridian, and of the strength anddisposition of his command.Forrest had about 4,000 cavalry with him, composed of thoroughlywell-disciplined men, who under so able a leader were very effective.Smith's command was nearly double that of Forrest, but not equal, man toman, for the lack of a successful experience such as Forrest's men hadhad.  The fact is, troops who have fought a few battles and won, andfollowed up their victories, improve upon what they were before to anextent that can hardly be counted by percentage.  The difference inresult is often decisive victory instead of inglorious defeat.  Thissame difference, too, is often due to the way troops are officered, andfor the particular kind of warfare which Forrest had carried on neitherarmy could present a more effective officer than he was.Sherman got off on the 3d of February and moved out on his expedition,meeting with no opposition whatever until he crossed the Big Black, andwith no great deal of opposition after that until he reached Jackson,Mississippi.  This latter place he reached on the 6th or 7th, Brandon onthe 8th, and Morton on the 9th.  Up to this time he moved in two columnsto enable him to get a good supply of forage, etc., and expedite themarch. Here, however, there were indications of the concentration ofConfederate infantry, and he was obliged to keep his army closetogether.  He had no serious engagement; but he met some of the enemywho destroyed a few of his wagons about Decatur, Mississippi, where, bythe way, Sherman himself came near being picked up.He entered Meridian on the 14th of the month, the enemy having retreatedtoward Demopolis, Alabama. He spent several days in Meridian inthoroughly destroying the railroad to the north and south, and also forthe purpose of hearing from Sooy Smith, who he supposed had met Forrestbefore this time and he hoped had gained a decisive victory because of asuperiority of numbers. Hearing nothing of him, however, he started onhis return trip to Vicksburg.  There he learned that Smith, whilewaiting for a few of his men who had been ice-bound in the Ohio River,instead of getting off on the 1st as expected, had not left until the11th.  Smith did meet Forrest, but the result was decidedly in Forrest'sfavor.Sherman had written a letter to Banks, proposing a co-operative movementwith him against Shreveport, subject to my approval.  I disapproved ofSherman's going himself, because I had other important work for him todo, but consented that he might send a few troops to the aid of Banks,though their time to remain absent must be limited.  We must have themfor the spring campaign.  The trans-Mississippi movement provedabortive.My eldest son, who had accompanied me on the Vicksburg campaign andsiege, had while there contracted disease, which grew worse, until hehad grown so dangerously ill that on the 24th of January I obtainedpermission to go to St. Louis, where he was staying at the time, to seehim, hardly expecting to find him alive on my arrival.  While I waspermitted to go, I was not permitted to turn over my command to any oneelse, but was directed to keep the headquarters with me and tocommunicate regularly with all parts of my division and with Washington,just as though I had remained at Nashville.When I obtained this leave I was at Chattanooga, having gone there againto make preparations to have the troops of Thomas in the southern partof Tennessee co-operate with Sherman's movement in Mississippi.  Idirected Thomas, and Logan who was at Scottsboro, Alabama, to keep up athreatening movement to the south against J. E. Johnston, who had againrelieved Bragg, for the purpose of making him keep as many troops aspossible there.I learned through Confederate sources that Johnston had already sent twodivisions in the direction of Mobile, presumably to operate againstSherman, and two more divisions to Longstreet in East Tennessee.  Seeingthat Johnston had depleted in this way, I directed Thomas to send atleast ten thousand men, besides Stanley's division which was already tothe east, into East Tennessee, and notified Schofield, who was now incommand in East Tennessee, of this movement of troops into hisdepartment and also of the reinforcements Longstreet had received.  Myobject was to drive Longstreet out of East Tennessee as a part of thepreparations for my spring campaign.About this time General Foster, who had been in command of theDepartment of the Ohio after Burnside until Schofield relieved him(*21), advised me that he thought it would be a good thing to keepLongstreet just where he was; that he was perfectly quiet in EastTennessee, and if he was forced to leave there, his whole well-equippedarmy would be free to go to any place where it could effect the most fortheir cause.  I thought the advice was good, and, adopting that view,countermanded the orders for pursuit of Longstreet.On the 12th of February I ordered Thomas to take Dalton and hold it, ifpossible; and I directed him to move without delay. Finding that he hadnot moved, on the 17th I urged him again to start, telling him howimportant it was, that the object of the movement was to co-operate withSherman, who was moving eastward and might be in danger.  Then again onthe 21st, he not yet having started, I asked him if he could not startthe next day.  He finally got off on the 22d or 23d.  The enemy fellback from his front without a battle, but took a new position quite asstrong and farther to the rear.  Thomas reported that he could not goany farther, because it was impossible with his poor teams, nearlystarved, to keep up supplies until the railroads were repaired.  He soonfell back.Schofield also had to return for the same reason.  He could not carrysupplies with him, and Longstreet was between him and the supplies stillleft in the country.  Longstreet, in his retreat, would be movingtowards his supplies, while our forces, following, would be recedingfrom theirs.  On the 2d of March, however, I learned of Sherman'ssuccess, which eased my mind very much.  The next day, the 3d, I wasordered to Washington.The bill restoring the grade of lieutenant-general of the army hadpassed through Congress and became a law on the 26th of February.  Mynomination had been sent to the Senate on the 1st of March and confirmedthe next day (the 2d).  I was ordered to Washington on the 3d to receivemy commission, and started the day following that.  The commission washanded to me on the 9th.  It was delivered to me at the ExecutiveMansion by President Lincoln in the presence of his Cabinet, my eldestson, those of my staff who were with me and and a few other visitors.The President in presenting my commission read from a paper--stating,however, as a preliminary, and prior to the delivery of it, that he haddrawn that up on paper, knowing my disinclination to speak in public,and handed me a copy in advance so that I might prepare a few lines ofreply.  The President said:'General Grant, the nation's appreciation of what you have done, and itsreliance upon you for what remains to be done in the existing greatstruggle, are now presented, with this commission constituting youlieutenant-general in the Army of the United States.  With this highhonor, devolves upon you, also, a corresponding responsibility.  As thecountry herein trusts you, so, under God, it will sustain you.  Iscarcely need to add, that, with what I here speak for the nation, goesmy own hearty personal concurrence.'To this I replied:  'Mr. President, I accept the commission, withgratitude for the high honor conferred.  With the aid of the noblearmies that have fought in so many fields for our common country, itwill be my earnest endeavor not to disappoint your expectations.  I feelthe full weight of the responsibilities now devolving on me; and I knowthat if they are met, it will be due to those armies, and above all, tothe favor of that Providence which leads both nations and men.'On the 10th I visited the headquarters of the Army of the Potomac atBrandy Station; then returned to Washington, and pushed west at once tomake my arrangements for turning over the commands there and givinggeneral directions for the preparations to be made for the springcampaign.It had been my intention before this to remain in the West, even if Iwas made lieutenant-general; but when I got to Washington and saw thesituation it was plain that here was the point for the commandinggeneral to be.  No one else could, probably, resist the pressure thatwould be brought to bear upon him to desist from his own plans andpursue others.  I determined, therefore, before I started back to haveSherman advanced to my late position, McPherson to Sherman's in commandof the department, and Logan to the command of McPherson's corps. Thesechanges were all made on my recommendation and without hesitation.  Mycommission as lieutenant-general was given to me on the 9th of March,1864.  On the following day, as already stated, I visited General Meade,commanding the Army of the Potomac, at his headquarters at BrandyStation, north of the Rapidan.  I had known General Meade slightly inthe Mexican war, but had not met him since until this visit.  I was astranger to most of the Army of the Potomac, I might say to all exceptthe officers of the regular army who had served in the Mexican war.There had been some changes ordered in the organization of that armybefore my promotion.  One was the consolidation of five corps intothree, thus throwing some officers of rank out of important commands.Meade evidently thought that I might want to make still one more changenot yet ordered.  He said to me that I might want an officer who hadserved with me in the West, mentioning Sherman specially, to take hisplace.  If so, he begged me not to hesitate about making the change.  Heurged that the work before us was of such vast importance to the wholenation that the feeling or wishes of no one person should stand in theway of selecting the right men for all positions.  For himself, he wouldserve to the best of his ability wherever placed.  I assured him that Ihad no thought of substituting any one for him.  As to Sherman, he couldnot be spared from the West.This incident gave me even a more favorable opinion of Meade than didhis great victory at Gettysburg the July before.  It is men who wait tobe selected, and not those who seek, from whom we may always expect themost efficient service.Meade's position afterwards proved embarrassing to me if not to him.  Hewas commanding an army and, for nearly a year previous to my takingcommand of all the armies, was in supreme command of the Army of thePotomac--except from the authorities at Washington.  All other generalofficers occupying similar positions were independent in their commandsso far as any one present with them was concerned.  I tried to makeGeneral Meade's position as nearly as possible what it would have beenif I had been in Washington or any other place away from his command.  Itherefore gave all orders for the movements of the Army of the Potomacto Meade to have them executed.  To avoid the necessity of having togive orders direct, I established my headquarters near his, unless therewere reasons for locating them elsewhere.  This sometimes happened, andI had on occasions to give orders direct to the troops affected.  On the11th I returned to Washington and, on the day after, orders werepublished by the War Department placing me in command of all the armies.I had left Washington the night before to return to my old command inthe West and to meet Sherman whom I had telegraphed to join me inNashville.Sherman assumed command of the military division of the Mississippi onthe 18th of March, and we left Nashville together for Cincinnati.  I hadSherman accompany me that far on my way back to Washington so that wecould talk over the matters about which I wanted to see him, withoutlosing any more time from my new command than was necessary.  The firstpoint which I wished to discuss was particularly about the co-operationof his command with mine when the spring campaign should commence. Therewere also other and minor points, minor as compared with the greatimportance of the question to be decided by sanguinary war--therestoration to duty of officers who had been relieved from importantcommands, namely McClellan, Burnside and Fremont in the East, and Buell,McCook, Negley and Crittenden in the West.Some time in the winter of 1863-64 I had been invited by thegeneral-in-chief to give my views of the campaign I thought advisablefor the command under me--now Sherman's.  General J. E. Johnston wasdefending Atlanta and the interior of Georgia with an army, the largESTJart of which was stationed at Dalton, about 38 miles south ofChattanooga. Dalton is at the junction of the railroad from Clevelandwith the one from Chattanooga to Atlanta.There could have been no difference of opinion as to the first duty ofthe armies of the military division of the Mississippi.  Johnston's armywas the first objective, and that important railroad centre, Atlanta,the second.  At the time I wrote General Halleck giving my views of theapproaching campaign, and at the time I met General Sherman, it wasexpected that General Banks would be through with the campaign which hehad been ordered upon before my appointment to the command of all thearmies, and would be ready to co-operate with the armies east of theMississippi, his part in the programme being to move upon Mobile by landwhile the navy would close the harbor and assist to the best of itsability. (*22) The plan therefore was for Sherman to attack Johnston anddestroy his army if possible, to capture Atlanta and hold it, and withhis troops and those of Banks to hold a line through to Mobile, or atleast to hold Atlanta and command the railroad running east and west,and the troops from one or other of the armies to hold important pointson the southern road, the only east and west road that would be left inthe possession of the enemy.  This would cut the Confederacy in twoagain, as our gaining possession of the Mississippi River had donebefore.  Banks was not ready in time for the part assigned to him, andcircumstances that could not be foreseen determined the campaign whichwas afterwards made, the success and grandeur of which has resoundedthroughout all lands.In regard to restoring officers who had been relieved from importantcommands to duty again, I left Sherman to look after those who had beenremoved in the West while I looked out for the rest.  I directed,however, that he should make no assignment until I could speak to theSecretary of War about the matter.  I shortly after recommended to theSecretary the assignment of General Buell to duty.  I received theassurance that duty would be offered to him; and afterwards theSecretary told me that he had offered Buell an assignment and that thelatter had declined it, saying that it would be degradation to acceptthe assignment offered.  I understood afterwards that he refused toserve under either Sherman or Canby because he had ranked them both.Both graduated before him and ranked him in the old army.  Shermanranked him as a brigadier-general.  All of them ranked me in the oldarmy, and Sherman and Buell did as brigadiers.  The worst excuse asoldier can make for declining service is that he once ranked thecommander he is ordered to report to.On the 23d of March I was back in Washington, and on the 26th took up myheadquarters at Culpeper Court-House, a few miles south of theheadquarters of the Army of the Potomac.Although hailing from Illinois myself, the State of the President, Inever met Mr. Lincoln until called to the capital to receive mycommission as lieutenant-general.  I knew him, however, very well andfavorably from the accounts given by officers under me at the West whohad known him all their lives.  I had also read the remarkable series ofdebates between Lincoln and Douglas a few years before, when they wererival candidates for the United States Senate.  I was then a resident ofMissouri, and by no means a 'Lincoln man' in that contest; but Irecognized then his great ability.In my first interview with Mr. Lincoln alone he stated to me that he hadnever professed to be a military man or to know how campaigns should beconducted, and never wanted to interfere in them:  but thatprocrastination on the part of commanders, and the pressure from thepeople at the North and Congress, WHICH WAS ALWAYS WITH HIM, forced himinto issuing his series of 'Military Orders'--one, two, three, etc.  Hedid not know but they were all wrong, and did know that some of themwere.  All he wanted or had ever wanted was some one who would take theresponsibility and act, and call on him for all the assistance needed,pledging himself to use all the power of the government in renderingsuch assistance.  Assuring him that I would do the best I could with themeans at hand, and avoid as far as possible annoying him or the WarDepartment, our first interview ended.The Secretary of War I had met once before only, but felt that I knewhim better.While commanding in West Tennessee we had occasionally heldconversations over the wires, at night, when they were not beingotherwise used.  He and General Halleck both cautioned me against givingthe President my plans of campaign, saying that he was so kind-hearted,so averse to refusing anything asked of him, that some friend would besure to get from him all he knew.  I should have said that in ourinterview the President told me he did not want to know what I proposedto do.  But he submitted a plan of campaign of his own which he wantedme to hear and then do as I pleased about.  He brought out a map ofVirginia on which he had evidently marked every position occupied by theFederal and Confederate armies up to that time.  He pointed out on themap two streams which empty into the Potomac, and suggested that thearmy might be moved on boats and landed between the mouths of thesestreams.  We would then have the Potomac to bring our supplies, and thetributaries would protect our flanks while we moved out.  I listenedrespectfully, but did not suggest that the same streams would protectLee's flanks while he was shutting us up.I did not communicate my plans to the President, nor did I to theSecretary of War or to General Halleck.March the 26th my headquarters were, as stated, at Culpeper, and thework of preparing for an early campaign commenced.
ISFP	 XLVII.THE MILITARY SITUATION--PLANS FOR THE CAMPAIGN--SHERIDAN ASSIGNED TOCOMMAND OF THE CAVALRY--FLANK MOVEMENTS--FORREST AT FORT PILLOW--GENERALBANKS'S EXPEDITION--COLONEL MOSBY--AN INCIDENT OF THE WILDERNESSCAMPAIGN.When I assumed command of all the armies the situation was about this:the Mississippi River was guarded from St. Louis to its mouth; the lineof the Arkansas was held, thus giving us all the North-west north ofthat river.  A few points in Louisiana not remote from the river wereheld by the Federal troops, as was also the mouth of the Rio Grande.East of the Mississippi we held substantially all north of the Memphisand Charleston Railroad as far east as Chattanooga, thence along theline of the Tennessee and Holston rivers, taking in nearly all of theState of Tennessee.  West Virginia was in our hands; and that part ofold Virginia north of the Rapidan and east of the Blue Ridge we alsoheld.  On the sea-coast we had Fortress Monroe and Norfolk in Virginia;Plymouth, Washington and New Berne in North Carolina; Beaufort, Follyand Morris islands, Hilton Head, Port Royal and Fort Pulaski in SouthCarolina and Georgia; Fernandina, St. Augustine, Key West and Pensacolain Florida. The balance of the Southern territory, an empire in extent,was still in the hands of the enemy.Sherman, who had succeeded me in the command of the military division ofthe Mississippi, commanded all the troops in the territory west of theAlleghanies and north of Natchez, with a large movable force aboutChattanooga. His command was subdivided into four departments, but thecommanders all reported to Sherman and were subject to his orders.  Thisarrangement, however, insured the better protection of all lines ofcommunication through the acquired territory, for the reason that thesedifferent department commanders could act promptly in case of a suddenor unexpected raid within their respective jurisdictions withoutawaiting the orders of the division commander.In the East the opposing forces stood in substantially the samerelations towards each other as three years before, or when the warbegan; they were both between the Federal and Confederate capitals.  Itis true, footholds had been secured by us on the sea-coast, in Virginiaand North Carolina, but, beyond that, no substantial advantage had beengained by either side.  Battles had been fought of as great severity ashad ever been known in war, over ground from the James River andChickahominy, near Richmond, to Gettysburg and Chambersburg, inPennsylvania, with indecisive results, sometimes favorable to theNational army, sometimes to the Confederate army; but in every instance,I believe, claimed as victories for the South by the Southern press ifnot by the Southern generals.  The Northern press, as a whole, did notdiscourage these claims; a portion of it always magnified rebel successand belittled ours, while another portion, most sincerely earnest intheir desire for the preservation of the Union and the overwhelmingsuccess of the Federal armies, would nevertheless generally expressdissatisfaction with whatever victories were gained because they werenot more complete.That portion of the Army of the Potomac not engaged in guarding lines ofcommunication was on the northern bank of the Rapidan.  The Army ofNorthern Virginia confronting it on the opposite bank of the same river,was strongly intrenched and commanded by the acknowledged ablest generalin the Confederate army.  The country back to the James River is cut upwith many streams, generally narrow, deep, and difficult to cross exceptwhere bridged.  The region is heavily timbered, and the roads narrow,and very bad after the least rain.  Such an enemy was not, of course,unprepared with adequate fortifications at convenient intervals all theway back to Richmond, so that when driven from one fortified positionthey would always have another farther to the rear to fall back into.To provision an army, campaigning against so formidable a foe throughsuch a country, from wagons alone seemed almost impossible.  System anddiscipline were both essential to its accomplishment.The Union armies were now divided into nineteen departments, though fourof them in the West had been concentrated into a single militarydivision.  The Army of the Potomac was a separate command and had noterritorial limits.  There were thus seventeen distinct commanders.Before this time these various armies had acted separately andindependently of each other, giving the enemy an opportunity often ofdepleting one command, not pressed, to reinforce another more activelyengaged.  I determined to stop this.  To this end I regarded the Army ofthe Potomac as the centre, and all west to Memphis along the linedescribed as our position at the time, and north of it, the right wing;the Army of the James, under General Butler, as the left wing, and allthe troops south, as a force in rear of the enemy.  Some of these latterwere occupying positions from which they could not render serviceproportionate to their numerical strength.  All such were depleted tothe minimum necessary to hold their positions as a guard againstblockade runners; where they could not do this their positions wereabandoned altogether.  In this way ten thousand men were added to theArmy of the James from South Carolina alone, with General Gillmore incommand.  It was not contemplated that General Gillmore should leave hisdepartment; but as most of his troops were taken, presumably for activeservice, he asked to accompany them and was permitted to do so.Officers and soldiers on furlough, of whom there were many thousands,were ordered to their proper commands; concentration was the order ofthe day, and to have it accomplished in time to advance at the earliestmoment the roads would permit was the problem.As a reinforcement to the Army of the Potomac, or to act in support ofit, the 9th army corps, over twenty thousand strong, under GeneralBurnside, had been rendezvoused at Annapolis, Maryland.  This was anadmirable position for such a reinforcement.  The corps could be broughtat the last moment as a reinforcement to the Army of the Potomac, or itcould be thrown on the sea-coast, south of Norfolk, in Virginia or NorthCarolina, to operate against Richmond from that direction.  In factBurnside and the War Department both thought the 9th corps was intendedfor such an expedition up to the last moment.My general plan now was to concentrate all the force possible againstthe Confederate armies in the field.  There were but two such, as wehave seen, east of the Mississippi River and facing north.  The Army ofNorthern Virginia, General Robert E. Lee commanding, was on the southbank of the Rapidan, confronting the Army of the Potomac; the second,under General Joseph E. Johnston, was at Dalton, Georgia, opposed toSherman who was still at Chattanooga. Beside these main armies theConfederates had to guard the Shenandoah Valley, a great storehouse tofeed their armies from, and their line of communications from Richmondto Tennessee.  Forrest, a brave and intrepid cavalry general, was in theWest with a large force; making a larger command necessary to hold whatwe had gained in Middle and West Tennessee.  We could not abandon anyterritory north of the line held by the enemy because it would lay theNorthern States open to invasion.  But as the Army of the Potomac wasthe principal garrison for the protection of Washington even while itwas moving on Lee, so all the forces to the west, and the Army of theJames, guarded their special trusts when advancing from them as well aswhen remaining at them.  Better indeed, for they forced the enemy toguard his own lines and resources at a greater distance from ours, andwith a greater force.  Little expeditions could not so well be sent outto destroy a bridge or tear up a few miles of railroad track, burn astorehouse, or inflict other little annoyances.  Accordingly I arrangedfor a simultaneous movement all along the line.  Sherman was to movefrom Chattanooga, Johnston's army and Atlanta being his objectivepoints. (*23)  Crook, commanding in West Virginia, was to move from themouth of the Gauley River with a cavalry force and some artillery, theVirginia and Tennessee Railroad to be his objective.  Either the enemywould have to keep a large force to protect their communications, or seethem destroyed and a large amount of forage and provision, which they somuch needed, fall into our hands.  Sigel was in command in the Valley ofVirginia. He was to advance up the valley, covering the North from aninvasion through that channel as well while advancing as by remainingnear Harper's Ferry.  Every mile he advanced also gave us possession ofstores on which Lee relied.  Butler was to advance by the James River,having Richmond and Petersburg as his objective.Before the advance commenced I visited Butler at Fort Monroe. This wasthe first time I had ever met him.  Before giving him any order as tothe part he was to play in the approaching campaign I invited his views.They were very much such as I intended to direct, and as I did direct(*24), in writing, before leaving.General W. F. Smith, who had been promoted to the rank of major-generalshortly after the battle of Chattanooga on my recommendation, had notyet been confirmed.  I found a decided prejudice against hisconfirmation by a majority of the Senate, but I insisted that hisservices had been such that he should be rewarded.  My wishes were nowreluctantly complied with, and I assigned him to the command of one ofthe corps under General Butler.  I was not long in finding out that theobjections to Smith's promotion were well founded.In one of my early interviews with the President I expressed mydissatisfaction with the little that had been accomplished by thecavalry so far in the war, and the belief that it was capable ofaccomplishing much more than it had done if under a thorough leader.  Isaid I wanted the very best man in the army for that command.  Halleckwas present and spoke up, saying: 'How would Sheridan do?'  I replied:'The very man I want.' The President said I could have anybody I wanted.Sheridan was telegraphed for that day, and on his arrival was assignedto the command of the cavalry corps with the Army of the Potomac.  Thisrelieved General Alfred Pleasonton.  It was not a reflection on thatofficer, however, for I did not know but that he had been as efficientas any other cavalry commander.Banks in the Department of the Gulf was ordered to assemble all thetroops he had at New Orleans in time to join in the general move, Mobileto be his objective.At this time I was not entirely decided as to whether I should move theArmy of the Potomac by the right flank of the enemy, or by his left.Each plan presented advantages. (*25)  If by his right--my left--thePotomac, Chesapeake Bay and tributaries would furnish us an easy haulingdistance of every position the army could occupy from the Rapidan to theJames River.  But Lee could, if he chose, detach or move his whole armynorth on a line rather interior to the one I would have to take infollowing.  A movement by his left--our right--would obviate this; butall that was done would have to be done with the supplies and ammunitionwe started with.  All idea of adopting this latter plan was abandonedwhen the limited quantity of supplies possible to take with us wasconsidered.  The country over which we would have to pass was soexhausted of all food or forage that we would be obliged to carryeverything with us.While these preparations were going on the enemy was not entirely idle.In the West Forrest made a raid in West Tennessee up to the northernborder, capturing the garrison of four or five hundred men at UnionCity, and followed it up by an attack on Paducah, Kentucky, on the banksof the Ohio.  While he was able to enter the city he failed to capturethe forts or any part of the garrison.  On the first intelligence ofForrest's raid I telegraphed Sherman to send all his cavalry againsthim, and not to let him get out of the trap he had put himself into.Sherman had anticipated me by sending troops against him before he gotmy order.Forrest, however, fell back rapidly, and attacked the troops at FortPillow, a station for the protection of the navigation of theMississippi River.  The garrison consisted of a regiment of coloredtroops, infantry, and a detachment of Tennessee cavalry.  These troopsfought bravely, but were overpowered.  I will leave Forrest in hisdispatches to tell what he did with them.'The river was dyed,' he says, 'with the blood of the slaughtered fortwo hundred yards.  The approximate loss was upward of five hundredkilled, but few of the officers escaping.  My loss was about twentykilled.  It is hoped that these facts will demonstrate to the Northernpeople that negro soldiers cannot cope with Southerners.'  SubsequentlyForrest made a report in which he left out the part which shockshumanity to read.At the East, also, the rebels were busy.  I had said to Halleck thatPlymouth and Washington, North Carolina, were unnecessary to hold.  Itwould be better to have the garrisons engaged there added to Butler'scommand.  If success attended our arms both places, and others too,would fall into our hands naturally. These places had been occupied byFederal troops before I took command of the armies, and I knew that theExecutive would be reluctant to abandon them, and therefore explained myviews; but before my views were carried out the rebels captured thegarrison at Plymouth.  I then ordered the abandonment of Washington, butdirected the holding of New Berne at all hazards.  This was essentialbecause New Berne was a port into which blockade runners could enter.General Banks had gone on an expedition up the Red River long before mypromotion to general command.  I had opposed the movement strenuously,but acquiesced because it was the order of my superior at the time.  Bydirection of Halleck I had reinforced Banks with a corps of about tenthousand men from Sherman's command.  This reinforcement was wanted backbadly before the forward movement commenced.  But Banks had got so farthat it seemed best that he should take Shreveport on the Red River, andturn over the line of that river to Steele, who commanded in Arkansas,to hold instead of the line of the Arkansas.  Orders were givenaccordingly, and with the expectation that the campaign would be endedin time for Banks to return A. J. Smith's command to where it belongedand get back to New Orleans himself in time to execute his part in thegeneral plan.  But the expedition was a failure.  Banks did not get backin time to take part in the programme as laid down. Nor was Smithreturned until long after the movements of May, 1864, had been begun.The services of forty thousand veteran troops, over and above the numberrequired to hold all that was necessary in the Department of the Gulf,were thus paralyzed. It is but just to Banks, however, to say that hisexpedition was ordered from Washington and he was in no way responsibleexcept for the conduct of it.  I make no criticism on this point.  Heopposed the expedition.By the 27th of April spring had so far advanced as to justify me infixing a day for the great move.  On that day Burnside left Annapolis tooccupy Meade's position between Bull Run and the Rappahannock.  Meadewas notified and directed to bring his troops forward to his advance.On the following day Butler was notified of my intended advance on the4th of May, and he was directed to move the night of the same day andget as far up the James River as possible by daylight, and push on fromthere to accomplish the task given him.  He was also notified thatreinforcements were being collected in Washington City, which would beforwarded to him should the enemy fall back into the trenches atRichmond.  The same day Sherman was directed to get his forces up readyto advance on the 5th.  Sigel was in Winchester and was notified to movein conjunction with the others.The criticism has been made by writers on the campaign from the Rapidanto the James River that all the loss of life could have been obviated bymoving the army there on transports.  Richmond was fortified andintrenched so perfectly that one man inside to defend was more thanequal to five outside besieging or assaulting.  To get possession ofLee's army was the first great object.  With the capture of his armyRichmond would necessarily follow.  It was better to fight him outsideof his stronghold than in it.  If the Army of the Potomac had been movedbodily to the James River by water Lee could have moved a part of hisforces back to Richmond, called Beauregard from the south to reinforceit, and with the balance moved on to Washington. Then, too, I ordered amove, simultaneous with that of the Army of the Potomac, up the JamesRiver by a formidable army already collected at the mouth of the river.While my headquarters were at Culpeper, from the 26th of March to the4th of May, I generally visited Washington once a week to confer withthe Secretary of War and President.  On the last occasion, a few daysbefore moving, a circumstance occurred which came near postponing mypart in the campaign altogether. Colonel John S. Mosby had for a longtime been commanding a partisan corps, or regiment, which operated inthe rear of the Army of the Potomac.  On my return to the field on thisoccasion, as the train approached Warrenton Junction, a heavy cloud ofdust was seen to the east of the road as if made by a body of cavalry ona charge.  Arriving at the junction the train was stopped and inquiriesmade as to the cause of the dust. There was but one man at the station,and he informed us that Mosby had crossed a few minutes before at fullspeed in pursuit of Federal cavalry.  Had he seen our train coming, nodoubt he would have let his prisoners escape to capture the train.  Iwas on a special train, if I remember correctly, without any guard.Since the close of the war I have come to know Colonel Mosby personally,and somewhat intimately.  He is a different man entirely from what I hadsupposed.  He is slender, not tall, wiry, and looks as if he couldendure any amount of physical exercise.  He is able, and thoroughlyhonest and truthful. There were probably but few men in the South whocould have commanded successfully a separate detachment in the rear ofan opposing army, and so near the border of hostilities, as long as hedid without losing his entire command.On this same visit to Washington I had my last interview with thePresident before reaching the James River.  He had of course becomeacquainted with the fact that a general movement had been ordered allalong the line, and seemed to think it a new feature in war.  Iexplained to him that it was necessary to have a great number of troopsto guard and hold the territory we had captured, and to preventincursions into the Northern States.  These troops could perform thisservice just as well by advancing as by remaining still; and byadvancing they would compel the enemy to keep detachments to hold themback, or else lay his own territory open to invasion.  His answer was:'Oh, yes!  I see that.  As we say out West, if a man can't skin he musthold a leg while somebody else does.'There was a certain incident connected with the Wilderness campaign ofwhich it may not be out of place to speak; and to avoid a digressionfurther on I will mention it here.A few days before my departure from Culpeper the Honorable E. B.Washburne visited me there, and remained with my headquarters for somedistance south, through the battle in the Wilderness and, I think, toSpottsylvania. He was accompanied by a Mr. Swinton, whom he presented asa literary gentleman who wished to accompany the army with a view ofwriting a history of the war when it was over.  He assured me--and Ihave no doubt Swinton gave him the assurance--that he was not present asa correspondent of the press.  I expressed an entire willingness to havehim (Swinton) accompany the army, and would have allowed him to do so asa correspondent, restricted, however, in the character of theinformation he could give.  We received Richmond papers with about asmuch regularity as if there had been no war, and knew that our paperswere received with equal regularity by the Confederates.  It wasdesirable, therefore, that correspondents should not be privileged spiesof the enemy within our lines.Probably Mr. Swinton expected to be an invited guest at my headquarters,and was disappointed that he was not asked to become so.  At all eventshe was not invited, and soon I found that he was corresponding with somepaper (I have now forgotten which one), thus violating his word eitherexpressed or implied.  He knew of the assurance Washburne had given asto the character of his mission.  I never saw the man from the day ofour introduction to the present that I recollect.  He accompanied us,however, for a time at least.The second night after crossing the Rapidan (the night of the 5th ofMay) Colonel W. R. Rowley, of my staff, was acting as night officer atmy headquarters.  A short time before midnight I gave him verbalinstructions for the night.  Three days later I read in a Richmond papera verbatim report of these instructions.A few nights still later (after the first, and possibly after thesecond, day's fighting in the Wilderness) General Meade came to my tentfor consultation, bringing with him some of his staff officers.  Bothhis staff and mine retired to the camp-fire some yards in front of thetent, thinking our conversation should be private.  There was a stump alittle to one side, and between the front of the tent and camp-fire.One of my staff, Colonel T. S. Bowers, saw what he took to be a manseated on the ground and leaning against the stump, listening to theconversation between Meade and myself.  He called the attention ofColonel Rowley to it.  The latter immediately took the man by theshoulder and asked him, in language more forcible than polite, what hewas doing there.  The man proved to be Swinton, the 'historian,' and hisreplies to the question were evasive and unsatisfactory, and he waswarned against further eaves-dropping.The next I heard of Mr. Swinton was at Cold Harbor.  General Meade cameto my headquarters saying that General Burnside had arrested Swinton,who at some previous time had given great offence, and had ordered himto be shot that afternoon.  I promptly ordered the prisoner to bereleased, but that he must be expelled from the lines of the army not toreturn again on pain of punishment.
ISFP	 XLVIII.COMMENCEMENT OF THE GRAND CAMPAIGN--GENERAL BUTLER'S POSITION--SHERIDAN'S FIRST RAID.The armies were now all ready to move for the accomplishment of a singleobject.  They were acting as a unit so far as such a thing was possibleover such a vast field.  Lee, with the capital of the Confederacy, wasthe main end to which all were working.  Johnston, with Atlanta, was animportant obstacle in the way of our accomplishing the result aimed at,and was therefore almost an independent objective.  It was of lessimportance only because the capture of Johnston and his army would notproduce so immediate and decisive a result in closing the rebellion aswould the possession of Richmond, Lee and his army.  All other troopswere employed exclusively in support of these two movements.  This wasthe plan; and I will now endeavor to give, as concisely as I can, themethod of its execution, outlining first the operations of minordetached but co-operative columns.As stated before, Banks failed to accomplish what he had been sent to doon the Red River, and eliminated the use of forty thousand veteranswhose cooperation in the grand campaign had been expected--ten thousandwith Sherman and thirty thousand against Mobile.Sigel's record is almost equally brief.  He moved out, it is true,according to programme; but just when I was hoping to hear of good workbeing done in the valley I received instead the following announcementfrom Halleck:  'Sigel is in full retreat on Strasburg.  He will donothing but run; never did anything else.'  The enemy had interceptedhim about New Market and handled him roughly, leaving him short sixguns, and some nine hundred men out of his six thousand.The plan had been for an advance of Sigel's forces in two columns.Though the one under his immediate command failed ingloriously the otherproved more fortunate.  Under Crook and Averell his western columnadvanced from the Gauley in West Virginia at the appointed time, andwith more happy results. They reached the Virginia and TennesseeRailroad at Dublin and destroyed a depot of supplies, besides tearing upseveral miles of road and burning the bridge over New River.  Havingaccomplished this they recrossed the Alleghanies to Meadow Bluffs andthere awaited further orders.Butler embarked at Fort Monroe with all his command, except the cavalryand some artillery which moved up the south bank of the James River.His steamers moved first up Chesapeake Bay and York River as ifthreatening the rear of Lee's army.  At midnight they turned back, andButler by daylight was far up the James River.  He seized City Point andBermuda Hundred early in the day, without loss and, no doubt, very muchto the surprise of the enemy.This was the accomplishment of the first step contemplated in myinstructions to Butler.  He was to act from here, looking to Richmond ashis objective point.  I had given him to understand that I should aim tofight Lee between the Rapidan and Richmond if he would stand; but shouldLee fall back into Richmond I would follow up and make a junction of thearmies of the Potomac and the James on the James River.  He was directedto secure a footing as far up the south side of the river as he could atas early a date as possible.Butler was in position by the 6th of May and had begun intrenching, andon the 7th he sent out his cavalry from Suffolk to cut the WeldonRailroad.  He also sent out detachments to destroy the railroad betweenPetersburg and Richmond, but no great success attended these latterefforts.  He made no great effort to establish himself on that road andneglected to attack Petersburg, which was almost defenceless.  About the11th he advanced slowly until he reached the works at Drury's Bluff,about half way between Bermuda Hundred and Richmond.  In the mean timeBeauregard had been gathering reinforcements.  On the 16th he attackedButler with great vigor, and with such success as to limit verymaterially the further usefulness of the Army of the James as a distinctfactor in the campaign.  I afterward ordered a portion of it to join theArmy of the Potomac, leaving a sufficient force with Butler to man hisworks, hold securely the footing he had already gained and maintain athreatening front toward the rear of the Confederate capital.The position which General Butler had chosen between the two rivers, theJames and Appomattox, was one of great natural strength, one where alarge area of ground might be thoroughly inclosed by means of a singleintrenched line, and that a very short one in comparison with the extentof territory which it thoroughly protected.  His right was protected bythe James River, his left by the Appomattox, and his rear by theirjunction--the two streams uniting near by.  The bends of the two streamsshortened the line that had been chosen for intrenchments, while itincreased the area which the line inclosed.Previous to ordering any troops from Butler I sent my chief engineer,General Barnard, from the Army of the Potomac to that of the James toinspect Butler's position and ascertain whether I could again safelymake an order for General Butler's movement in co-operation with mine,now that I was getting so near Richmond; or, if I could not, whether hisposition was strong enough to justify me in withdrawing some of histroops and having them brought round by water to White House to join meand reinforce the Army of the Potomac.  General Barnard reported theposition very strong for defensive purposes, and that I could do thelatter with great security; but that General Butler could not move fromwhere he was, in co-operation, to produce any effect. He said that thegeneral occupied a place between the James and Appomattox rivers whichwas of great strength, and where with an inferior force he could hold itfor an indefinite length of time against a superior; but that he coulddo nothing offensively.  I then asked him why Butler could not move outfrom his lines and push across the Richmond and Petersburg Railroad tothe rear and on the south side of Richmond.  He replied that it wasimpracticable, because the enemy had substantially the same line acrossthe neck of land that General Butler had.  He then took out his penciland drew a sketch of the locality, remarking that the position was likea bottle and that Butler's line of intrenchments across the neckrepresented the cork; that the enemy had built an equally strong lineimmediately in front of him across the neck; and it was therefore as ifButler was in a bottle.  He was perfectly safe against an attack; but,as Barnard expressed it, the enemy had corked the bottle and with asmall force could hold the cork in its place.  This struck me as beingvery expressive of his position, particularly when I saw the hastysketch which General Barnard had drawn; and in making my subsequentreport I used that expression without adding quotation marks, neverthinking that anything had been said that would attract attention--asthis did, very much to the annoyance, no doubt, of General Butler and, Iknow, very much to my own.  I found afterwards that this was mentionedin the notes of General Badeau's book, which, when they were shown tome, I asked to have stricken out; yet it was retained there, thoughagainst my wishes.I make this statement here because, although I have often made itbefore, it has never been in my power until now to place it where itwill correct history; and I desire to rectify all injustice that I mayhave done to individuals, particularly to officers who were gallantlyserving their country during the trying period of the war for thepreservation of the Union. General Butler certainly gave his veryearnest support to the war; and he gave his own best efforts personallyto the suppression of the rebellion.The further operations of the Army of the James can best be treated ofin connection with those of the Army of the Potomac, the two being sointimately associated and connected as to be substantially one body inwhich the individuality of the supporting wing is merged.Before giving the reader a summary of Sherman's great Atlanta campaign,which must conclude my description of the various co-operative movementspreparatory to proceeding with that of the operations of the centre, Iwill briefly mention Sheridan's first raid upon Lee's communicationswhich, though an incident of the operations on the main line and notspecifically marked out in the original plan, attained in its brilliantexecution and results all the proportions of an independent campaign.By thus anticipating, in point of time, I will be able to more perfectlyobserve the continuity of events occurring in my immediate front when Ishall have undertaken to describe our advance from the Rapidan.On the 8th of May, just after the battle of the Wilderness and when wewere moving on Spottsylvania I directed Sheridan verbally to cut loosefrom the Army of the Potomac, pass around the left of Lee's army andattack his cavalry:  to cut the two roads--one running west throughGordonsville, Charlottesville and Lynchburg, the other to Richmond, and,when compelled to do so for want of forage and rations, to move on tothe James River and draw these from Butler's supplies.  This move tookhim past the entire rear of Lee's army.  These orders were also given inwriting through Meade.The object of this move was three-fold.  First, if successfullyexecuted, and it was, he would annoy the enemy by cutting his line ofsupplies and telegraphic communications, and destroy or get for his ownuse supplies in store in the rear and coming up.  Second, he would drawthe enemy's cavalry after him, and thus better protect our flanks, rearand trains than by remaining with the army.  Third, his absence wouldsave the trains drawing his forage and other supplies fromFredericksburg, which had now become our base.  He started at daylightthe next morning, and accomplished more than was expected.  It wassixteen days before he got back to the Army of the Potomac.The course Sheridan took was directly to Richmond.  Before night Stuart,commanding the Confederate cavalry, came on to the rear of his command.But the advance kept on, crossed the North Anna, and at Beaver Dam, astation on the Virginia Central Railroad, recaptured four hundred Unionprisoners on their way to Richmond, destroyed the road and used anddestroyed a large amount of subsistence and medical stores.Stuart, seeing that our cavalry was pushing towards Richmond, abandonedthe pursuit on the morning of the 10th and, by a detour and anexhausting march, interposed between Sheridan and Richmond at YellowTavern, only about six miles north of the city.  Sheridan destroyed therailroad and more supplies at Ashland, and on the 11th arrived inStuart's front.  A severe engagement ensued in which the losses wereheavy on both sides, but the rebels were beaten, their leader mortallywounded, and some guns and many prisoners were captured.Sheridan passed through the outer defences of Richmond, and could, nodoubt, have passed through the inner ones.  But having no supports nearhe could not have remained.  After caring for his wounded he struck forthe James River below the city, to communicate with Butler and to resthis men and horses as well as to get food and forage for them.He moved first between the Chickahominy and the James, but in themorning (the 12th) he was stopped by batteries at Mechanicsville.  Hethen turned to cross to the north side of the Chickahominy by MeadowBridge.  He found this barred, and the defeated Confederate cavalry,reorganized, occupying the opposite side.  The panic created by hisfirst entrance within the outer works of Richmond having subsided troopswere sent out to attack his rear.He was now in a perilous position, one from which but few generals couldhave extricated themselves.  The defences of Richmond, manned, were tothe right, the Chickahominy was to the left with no bridge remaining andthe opposite bank guarded, to the rear was a force from Richmond.  Thisforce was attacked and beaten by Wilson's and Gregg's divisions, whileSheridan turned to the left with the remaining division and hastilybuilt a bridge over the Chickahominy under the fire of the enemy, forceda crossing and soon dispersed the Confederates he found there. The enemywas held back from the stream by the fire of the troops not engaged inbridge building.On the 13th Sheridan was at Bottom's Bridge, over the Chickahominy.  Onthe 14th he crossed this stream and on that day went into camp on theJames River at Haxall's Landing.  He at once put himself intocommunication with General Butler, who directed all the supplies hewanted to be furnished.Sheridan had left the Army of the Potomac at Spottsylvania, but did notknow where either this or Lee's army was now.  Great caution thereforehad to be exercised in getting back.  On the 17th, after resting hiscommand for three days, he started on his return.  He moved by the wayof White House.  The bridge over the Pamunkey had been burned by theenemy, but a new one was speedily improvised and the cavalry crossedover it.  On the 22d he was at Aylett's on the Matapony, where helearned the position of the two armies.  On the 24th he joined us on themarch from North Anna to Cold Harbor, in the vicinity of Chesterfield.Sheridan in this memorable raid passed entirely around Lee's army:encountered his cavalry in four engagements, and defeated them in all;recaptured four hundred Union prisoners and killed and captured many ofthe enemy; destroyed and used many supplies and munitions of war;destroyed miles of railroad and telegraph, and freed us from annoyanceby the cavalry of the enemy for more than two weeks.
ISFP	 XLIX.SHERMAN'S CAMPAIGN IN GEORGIA--SIEGE OF ATLANTA--DEATH OF GENERALMCPHERSON--ATTEMPT TO CAPTURE ANDERSONVILLE--CAPTURE OF ATLANTA.After separating from Sherman in Cincinnati I went on to Washington, asalready stated, while he returned to Nashville to assume the duties ofhis new command.  His military division was now composed of fourdepartments and embraced all the territory west of the AlleghanyMountains and east of the Mississippi River, together with the State ofArkansas in the trans-Mississippi.  The most easterly of these was theDepartment of the Ohio, General Schofield commanding; the next was theDepartment of the Cumberland, General Thomas commanding; the third theDepartment of the Tennessee, General McPherson commanding; and GeneralSteele still commanded the trans-Mississippi, or Department of Arkansas.The last-named department was so far away that Sherman could notcommunicate with it very readily after starting on his spring campaign,and it was therefore soon transferred from his military division to thatof the Gulf, where General Canby, who had relieved General Banks, was incommand.The movements of the armies, as I have stated in a former chapter, wereto be simultaneous, I fixing the day to start when the season should befar enough advanced, it was hoped, for the roads to be in a conditionfor the troops to march.General Sherman at once set himself to work preparing for the task whichwas assigned him to accomplish in the spring campaign.  McPherson lay atHuntsville with about twenty-four thousand men, guarding those points ofTennessee which were regarded as most worth holding; Thomas, with oversixty thousand men of the Army of the Cumberland, was at Chattanooga;and Schofield, with about fourteen thousand men, was at Knoxville. Withthese three armies, numbering about one hundred thousand men in all,Sherman was to move on the day fixed for the general advance, with aview of destroying Johnston's army and capturing Atlanta. He visitedeach of these commands to inform himself as to their condition, and itwas found to be, speaking generally, good.One of the first matters to turn his attention to was that of getting,before the time arrived for starting, an accumulation of suppliesforward to Chattanooga, sufficiently large to warrant a movement.  Hefound, when he got to that place, that the trains over the single-trackrailroad, which was frequently interrupted for a day or two at a time,were only sufficient to meet the daily wants of the troops withoutbringing forward any surplus of any kind.  He found, however, thattrains were being used to transport all the beef cattle, horses for thecavalry, and even teams that were being brought to the front.  He atonce changed all this, and required beef cattle, teams, cavalry horses,and everything that could travel, even the troops, to be marched, andused the road exclusively for transporting supplies.  In this way he wasable to accumulate an abundance before the time finally fixed upon forthe move, the 4th of May.As I have said already, Johnston was at Dalton, which was nearlyone-fourth of the way between Chattanooga and Atlanta. The country ismountainous all the way to Atlanta, abounding in mountain streams, someof them of considerable volume.  Dalton is on ground where water drainstowards Atlanta and into one of the main streams rising north-east fromthere and flowing south-west--this being the general direction which allthe main streams of that section take, with smaller tributaries enteringinto them.  Johnston had been preparing himself for this campaign duringthe entire winter.  The best positions for defence had been selected allthe way from Dalton back to Atlanta, and very strongly intrenched; sothat, as he might be forced to fall back from one position, he wouldhave another to fall into in his rear.  His position at Dalton was sovery strongly intrenched that no doubt he expected, or at least hoped,to hold Sherman there and prevent him from getting any further.  With aless skilful general, and one disposed to take no risks, I have no doubtthat he would have succeeded.Sherman's plan was to start Schofield, who was farthest back, a few daysin advance from Knoxville, having him move on the direct road to Dalton.Thomas was to move out to Ringgold.  It had been Sherman's intention tocross McPherson over the Tennessee River at Huntsville or Decatur, andmove him south from there so as to have him come into the road runningfrom Chattanooga to Atlanta a good distance to the rear of the pointJohnston was occupying; but when that was contemplated it was hoped thatMcPherson alone would have troops enough to cope with Johnston, if thelatter should move against him while unsupported by the balance of thearmy.  In this he was disappointed.  Two of McPherson's veterandivisions had re-enlisted on the express provision that they were tohave a furlough.  This furlough had not yet expired, and they were notback.Then, again, Sherman had lent Banks two divisions under A. J. Smith, thewinter before, to co-operate with the trans-Mississippi forces, and thiswith the express pledge that they should be back by a time specified, soas to be prepared for this very campaign.  It is hardly necessary to saythey were not returned.  That department continued to absorb troops tono purpose to the end of the war.  This left McPherson so weak that thepart of the plan above indicated had to be changed.  He was thereforebrought up to Chattanooga and moved from there on a road to the right ofThomas--the two coming together about Dalton.  The three armies wereabreast, all ready to start promptly on time.Sherman soon found that Dalton was so strongly fortified that it wasuseless to make any attempt to carry it by assault; and even to carry itby regular approaches was impracticable.  There was a narrowing up inthe mountain, between the National and Confederate armies, through whicha stream, a wagon road and a railroad ran.  Besides, the stream had beendammed so that the valley was a lake.  Through this gorge the troopswould have to pass.  McPherson was therefore sent around by the right,to come out by the way of Snake Creek Gap into the rear of the enemy.This was a surprise to Johnston, and about the 13th he decided toabandon his position at Dalton.On the 15th there was very hard fighting about Resaca; but our cavalryhaving been sent around to the right got near the road in the enemy'srear.  Again Johnston fell back, our army pursuing.  The pursuit wascontinued to Kingston, which was reached on the 19th with very littlefighting, except that Newton's division overtook the rear of Johnston'sarmy and engaged it.  Sherman was now obliged to halt for the purpose ofbringing up his railroad trains.  He was depending upon the railroad forall of his supplies, and as of course the railroad was wholly destroyedas Johnston fell back, it had to be rebuilt.  This work was pushedforward night and day, and caused much less delay than most personswould naturally expect in a mountainous country where there were so manybridges to be rebuilt.The campaign to Atlanta was managed with the most consummate skill, theenemy being flanked out of one position after another all the way there.It is true this was not accomplished without a good deal of fighting--some of it very hard fighting, rising to the dignity of very importantbattles--neither were single positions gained in a day.  On thecontrary, weeks were spent at some; and about Atlanta more than a monthwas consumed.It was the 23d of May before the road was finished up to the rear ofSherman's army and the pursuit renewed.  This pursuit brought him up tothe vicinity of Allatoona. This place was very strongly intrenched, andnaturally a very defensible position. An assault upon it was not thoughtof, but preparations were made to flank the enemy out of it.  This wasdone by sending a large force around our right, by the way of Dallas, toreach the rear of the enemy.  Before reaching there, however, they foundthe enemy fortified in their way, and there resulted hard fighting forabout a week at a place called New Hope Church.  On the left our troopsalso were fortified, and as close up to the enemy as they could get.They kept working still farther around to the left toward the railroad.This was the case more particularly with the cavalry.  By the 4th ofJune Johnston found that he was being hemmed in so rapidly that he drewoff and Allatoona was left in our possession.Allatoona, being an important place, was strongly intrenched foroccupation by our troops before advancing farther, and made a secondarybase of supplies.  The railroad was finished up to that point, theintrenchments completed, storehouses provided for food, and the army gotin readiness for a further advance. The rains, however, were falling insuch torrents that it was impossible to move the army by the side roadswhich they would have to move upon in order to turn Johnston out of hisnew position.While Sherman's army lay here, General F. P. Blair returned to it,bringing with him the two divisions of veterans who had been onfurlough.Johnston had fallen back to Marietta and Kenesaw Mountain, where strongintrenchments awaited him.  At this latter place our troops made anassault upon the enemy's lines after having got their own lines up closeto him, and failed, sustaining considerable loss.  But during theprogress of the battle Schofield was gaining ground to the left; and thecavalry on his left were gaining still more toward the enemy's rear.These operations were completed by the 3d of July, when it was foundthat Johnston had evacuated the place.  He was pursued at once.  Shermanhad made every preparation to abandon the railroad, leaving a strongguard in his intrenchments.  He had intended, moving out with twentydays' rations and plenty of ammunition, to come in on the railroad againat the Chattahoochee River.  Johnston frustrated this plan by himselfstarting back as above stated.  This time he fell back to theChattahoochee.About the 5th of July he was besieged again, Sherman getting easypossession of the Chattahoochee River both above and below him.  Theenemy was again flanked out of his position, or so frightened byflanking movements that on the night of the 9th he fell back across theriver.Here Johnston made a stand until the 17th, when Sherman's old tacticsprevailed again and the final movement toward Atlanta began.  Johnstonwas now relieved of the command, and Hood superseded him.Johnston's tactics in this campaign do not seem to have met with muchfavor, either in the eyes of the administration at Richmond, or of thepeople of that section of the South in which he was commanding.  Thevery fact of a change of commanders being ordered under suchcircumstances was an indication of a change of policy, and that now theywould become the aggressors--the very thing our troops wanted.For my own part, I think that Johnston's tactics were right. Anythingthat could have prolonged the war a year beyond the time that it didfinally close, would probably have exhausted the North to such an extentthat they might then have abandoned the contest and agreed to aseparation.Atlanta was very strongly intrenched all the way around in a circleabout a mile and a half outside of the city.  In addition to this, therewere advanced intrenchments which had to be taken before a close siegecould be commenced.Sure enough, as indicated by the change of commanders, the enemy wasabout to assume the offensive.  On the 20th he came out and attacked theArmy of the Cumberland most furiously.  Hooker's corps, and Newton's andJohnson's divisions were the principal ones engaged in this contest,which lasted more than an hour; but the Confederates were then forced tofall back inside their main lines.  The losses were quite heavy on bothsides.  On this day General Gresham, since our Postmaster-General, wasvery badly wounded.  During the night Hood abandoned his outer lines,and our troops were advanced.  The investment had not been relinquishedfor a moment during the day.During the night of the 21st Hood moved out again, passing by our leftflank, which was then in motion to get a position farther in rear ofhim, and a desperate battle ensued, which lasted most of the day of the22d.  At first the battle went very much in favor of the Confederates,our troops being somewhat surprised.  While our troops were advancingthey were struck in flank, and their flank was enveloped.  But they hadbecome too thorough veterans to be thrown into irreparable confusion byan unexpected attack when off their guard, and soon they were in orderand engaging the enemy, with the advantage now of knowing where theirantagonist was.  The field of battle continued to expand until itembraced about seven miles of ground.  Finally, however, and beforenight, the enemy was driven back into the city (*26).It was during this battle that McPherson, while passing from one columnto another, was instantly killed.  In his death the army lost one of itsablest, purest and best generals.Garrard had been sent out with his cavalry to get upon the railroad eastof Atlanta and to cut it in the direction of Augusta. He was successfulin this, and returned about the time of the battle.  Rousseau had alsocome up from Tennessee with a small division of cavalry, having crossedthe Tennessee River about Decatur and made a raid into Alabama. Finally,when hard pressed, he had come in, striking the railroad in rear ofSherman, and reported to him about this time.The battle of the 22d is usually known as the Battle of Atlanta,although the city did not fall into our hands until the 2d of September.Preparations went on, as before, to flank the enemy out of his position.The work was tedious, and the lines that had to be maintained were verylong.  Our troops were gradually worked around to the east until theystruck the road between Decatur and Atlanta. These lines were stronglyfortified, as were those to the north and west of the city--all as closeup to the enemy's lines as practicable--in order to hold them with thesmallest possible number of men, the design being to detach an army tomove by our right and try to get upon the railroad down south ofAtlanta.On the 27th the movement by the right flank commenced.  On the 28th theenemy struck our right flank, General Logan commanding, with greatvigor.  Logan intrenched himself hastily, and by that means was enabledto resist all assaults and inflict a great deal of damage upon theenemy.  These assaults were continued to the middle of the afternoon,and resumed once or twice still later in the day.  The enemy's losses inthese unsuccessful assaults were fearful.During that evening the enemy in Logan's front withdrew into the town.This now left Sherman's army close up to the Confederate lines,extending from a point directly east of the city around by the north andwest of it for a distance of fully ten miles; the whole of this linebeing intrenched, and made stronger every day they remained there.In the latter part of July Sherman sent Stoneman to destroy therailroads to the south, about Macon.  He was then to go east and, ifpossible, release our prisoners about Andersonville. There were painfulstories current at the time about the great hardships these prisonershad to endure in the way of general bad treatment, in the way in whichthey were housed, and in the way in which they were fed.  Great sympathywas felt for them; and it was thought that even if they could be turnedloose upon the country it would be a great relief to them.  But theattempt proved a failure.  McCook, who commanded a small brigade, wasfirst reported to have been captured; but he got back, having inflicteda good deal of damage upon the enemy.  He had also taken some prisoners;but encountering afterwards a largely superior force of the enemy he wasobliged to drop his prisoners and get back as best he could with whatmen he had left.  He had lost several hundred men out of his smallcommand.  On the 4th of August Colonel Adams, commanding a littlebrigade of about a thousand men, returned reporting Stoneman and all buthimself as lost.  I myself had heard around Richmond of the capture ofStoneman, and had sent Sherman word, which he received.  The rumor wasconfirmed there, also, from other sources.  A few days after ColonelAdams's return Colonel Capron also got in with a small detachment andconfirmed the report of the capture of Stoneman with something less thana thousand men.It seems that Stoneman, finding the escape of all his force wasimpossible, had made arrangements for the escape of two divisions.  Hecovered the movement of these divisions to the rear with a force ofabout seven hundred men, and at length surrendered himself and thisdetachment to the commanding Confederate.  In this raid, however, muchdamage was inflicted upon the enemy by the destruction of cars,locomotives, army wagons, manufactories of military supplies, etc.On the 4th and 5th Sherman endeavored to get upon the railroad to ourright, where Schofield was in command, but these attempts failedutterly.  General Palmer was charged with being the cause of thisfailure, to a great extent, by both General Sherman and GeneralSchofield; but I am not prepared to say this, although a question seemsto have arisen with Palmer as to whether Schofield had any right tocommand him.  If he did raise this question while an action was goingon, that act alone was exceedingly reprehensible.About the same time Wheeler got upon our railroad north of Resaca anddestroyed it nearly up to Dalton.  This cut Sherman off fromcommunication with the North for several days.  Sherman responded tothis attack on his lines of communication by directing one upon theirs.Kilpatrick started on the night of the 18th of August to reach the Maconroad about Jonesboro.  He succeeded in doing so, passed entirely aroundthe Confederate lines of Atlanta, and was back again in his formerposition on our left by the 22d.  These little affairs, however,contributed but very little to the grand result.  They annoyed, it istrue, but any damage thus done to a railroad by any cavalry expeditionis soon repaired.Sherman made preparations for a repetition of his tactics; that is, fora flank movement with as large a force as could be got together to somepoint in the enemy's rear.  Sherman commenced this last movement on the25th of August, and on the 1st of September was well up towards therailroad twenty miles south of Atlanta.  Here he found Hardeeintrenched, ready to meet him.  A battle ensued, but he was unable todrive Hardee away before night set in.  Under cover of the night,however, Hardee left of his own accord.  That night Hood blew up hismilitary works, such as he thought would be valuable in our hands, anddecamped.The next morning at daylight General H. W. Slocum, who was commandingnorth of the city, moved in and took possession of Atlanta, and notifiedSherman.  Sherman then moved deliberately back, taking three days toreach the city, and occupied a line extending from Decatur on the leftto Atlanta in the centre, with his troops extending out of the city forsome distance to the right.The campaign had lasted about four months, and was one of the mostmemorable in history.  There was but little if anything in the wholecampaign, now that it is over, to criticise at all, and nothing tocriticise severely.  It was creditable alike to the general whocommanded and the army which had executed it. Sherman had on thiscampaign some bright, wide-awake division and brigade commanders whosealertness added a host to the efficiency of his command.The troops now went to work to make themselves comfortable, and to enjoya little rest after their arduous campaign.  The city of Atlanta wasturned into a military base.  The citizens were all compelled to leave.Sherman also very wisely prohibited the assembling of the army ofsutlers and traders who always follow in the wake of an army in thefield, if permitted to do so, from trading with the citizens and gettingthe money of the soldiers for articles of but little use to them, andfor which they are made to pay most exorbitant prices.  He limited thenumber of these traders to one for each of his three armies.The news of Sherman's success reached the North instantaneously, and setthe country all aglow.  This was the first great political campaign forthe Republicans in their canvass of 1864.  It was followed later bySheridan's campaign in the Shenandoah Valley; and these two campaignsprobably had more effect in settling the election of the followingNovember than all the speeches, all the bonfires, and all the paradingwith banners and bands of music in the North.
ISFP	 L.GRAND MOVEMENT OF THE ARMY OF THE POTOMAC--CROSSING THE RAPIDAN--ENTERING THE WILDERNESS--BATTLE OF THE WILDERNESS.Soon after midnight, May 3d-4th, the Army of the Potomac moved out fromits position north Rapidan, to start upon that memorable campaign,destined to result in the capture of the Confederate capital and thearmy defending it.  This was not to be accomplished, however, without asdesperate fighting as the world has ever witnessed; not to beconsummated in a day, a week, a month, single season.  The lossesinflicted, and endured, were destined to be severe; but the armies nowconfronting each other had already been in deadly conflict for a periodof three years, with immense losses in killed, by death from sickness,captured and wounded; and neither had made any real progressaccomplishing the final end.  It is true the Confederates had, so far,held their capital, and they claimed this to be their sole object.  Butpreviously they had boldly proclaimed their intention to capturePhiladelphia, New York, and the National Capital, and had made severalattempts to do so, and once or twice had come fearfully near makingtheir boast good--too near for complacent contemplation by the loyalNorth. They had also come near losing their own capital on at least oneoccasion.  So here was a stand-off.  The campaign now begun was destinedto result in heavier losses, to both armies, in a given time, than anypreviously suffered; but the carnage was to be limited to a single year,and to accomplish all that had been anticipated or desired at thebeginning in that time.  We had to have hard fighting to achieve this.The two armies had been confronting each other so long, without anydecisive result, that they hardly knew which could whip.Ten days' rations, with a supply of forage and ammunition were taken inwagons.  Beef cattle were driven with the trains, and butchered aswanted.  Three days rations in addition, in haversacks, and fifty roundsof cartridges, were carried on the person of each soldier.The country over which the army had to operate, from the Rapidan to thecrossing of the James River, is rather flat, and is cut by numerousstreams which make their way to the Chesapeake Bay.  The crossings ofthese streams by the army were generally made not far above tide-water,and where they formed a considerable obstacle to the rapid advance oftroops even when the enemy did not appear in opposition.  The countryroads were narrow and poor. Most of the country is covered with a denseforest, in places, like the Wilderness and along the Chickahominy,almost impenetrable even for infantry except along the roads.  Allbridges were naturally destroyed before the National troops came tothem.The Army of the Potomac was composed of three infantry and one cavalrycorps, commanded respectively by Generals W. S. Hancock, G. K. Warren,(*27) John Sedgwick and P. H. Sheridan.  The artillery was commanded byGeneral Henry J. Hunt.  This arm was in such abundance that the fourthof it could not be used to advantage in such a country as we weredestined to pass through.  The surplus was much in the way, taking up asit did so much of the narrow and bad roads, and consuming so much of theforage and other stores brought up by the trains.The 5th corps, General Warren commanding, was in advance on the right,and marched directly for Germania Ford, preceded by one division ofcavalry, under General J. H. Wilson.  General Sedgwick followed Warrenwith the 6th corps.  Germania Ford was nine or ten miles below the rightof Lee's line.  Hancock, with the 2d corps, moved by another road,farther east, directly upon Ely's Ford, six miles below Germania,preceded by Gregg's division of cavalry, and followed by the artillery.Torbert's division of cavalry was left north of the Rapidan, for thetime, to picket the river and prevent the enemy from crossing andgetting into our rear.  The cavalry seized the two crossings beforedaylight, drove the enemy's pickets guarding them away, and by sixo'clock A.M. had the pontoons laid ready for the crossing of theinfantry and artillery.  This was undoubtedly a surprise to Lee.  Thefact that the movement was unopposed proves this.Burnside, with the 9th corps, was left back at Warrenton, guarding therailroad from Bull Run forward to preserve control of it in case ourcrossing the Rapidan should be long delayed. He was instructed, however,to advance at once on receiving notice that the army had crossed; and adispatch was sent to him a little after one P.M. giving the informationthat our crossing had been successful.The country was heavily wooded at all the points of crossing,particularly on the south side of the river.  The battle-field from thecrossing of the Rapidan until the final movement from the Wildernesstoward Spottsylvania was of the same character. There were someclearings and small farms within what might be termed the battle-field;but generally the country was covered with a dense forest.  The roadswere narrow and bad.  All the conditions were favorable for defensiveoperations.There are two roads, good for that part of Virginia, running from OrangeCourt House to the battle-field.  The most southerly of these roads isknown as the Orange Court House Plank Road, the northern one as theOrange Turnpike.  There are also roads from east of the battle-fieldrunning to Spottsylvania Court House, one from Chancellorsville,branching at Aldrich's; the western branch going by Piney Branch Church,Alsop's, thence by the Brock Road to Spottsylvania; the east branch goesby Gates's, thence to Spottsylvania.  The Brock Road runs from GermaniaFord through the battle-field and on to the Court House.  AsSpottsylvania is approached the country is cut up with numerous roads,some going to the town direct, and others crossing so as to connect thefarms with roads going there.Lee's headquarters were at Orange Court House.  From there toFredericksburg he had the use of the two roads above described runningnearly parallel to the Wilderness.  This gave him unusual facilities,for that country, for concentrating his forces to his right.  Theseroads strike the road from Germania Ford in the Wilderness.As soon as the crossing of the infantry was assured, the cavalry pushedforward, Wilson's division by Wilderness Tavern to Parker's store, onthe Orange Plank Road; Gregg to the left towards Chancellorsville.Warren followed Wilson and reached the Wilderness Tavern by noon, tookposition there and intrenched.  Sedgwick followed Warren.  He was acrossthe river and in camp on the south bank, on the right of Warren, bysundown.  Hancock, with the 2d corps, moved parallel with Warren andcamped about six miles east of him.  Before night all the troops, and bythe evening of the 5th the trains of more than four thousand wagons,were safely on the south side of the river.There never was a corps better organized than was the quartermaster'scorps with the Army of the Potomac in 1864. With a wagon-train thatwould have extended from the Rapidan to Richmond, stretched along insingle file and separated as the teams necessarily would be when moving,we could still carry only three days' forage and about ten to twelvedays' rations, besides a supply of ammunition.  To overcome alldifficulties, the chief quartermaster, General Rufus Ingalls, had markedon each wagon the corps badge with the division color and the number ofthe brigade.  At a glance, the particular brigade to which any wagonbelonged could be told.  The wagons were also marked to note thecontents:  if ammunition, whether for artillery or infantry; if forage,whether grain or hay; if rations, whether, bread, pork, beans, rice,sugar, coffee or whatever it might be.  Empty wagons were never allowedto follow the army or stay in camp.  As soon as a wagon was empty itwould return to the base of supply for a load of precisely the samearticle that had been taken from it.  Empty trains were obliged to leavethe road free for loaded ones.  Arriving near the army they would beparked in fields nearest to the brigades they belonged to.  Issues,except of ammunition, were made at night in all cases.  By this systemthe hauling of forage for the supply train was almost wholly dispensedwith.  They consumed theirs at the depots.I left Culpeper Court House after all the troops had been put in motion,and passing rapidly to the front, crossed the Rapidan in advance ofSedgwick's corps; and established headquarters for the afternoon andnight in a deserted house near the river.Orders had been given, long before this movement began, to cut down thebaggage of officers and men to the lowest point possible.Notwithstanding this I saw scattered along the road from Culpeper toGermania Ford wagon-loads of new blankets and overcoats, thrown away bythe troops to lighten their knapsacks; an improvidence I had neverwitnessed before.Lee, while his pickets and signal corps must have discovered at a veryearly hour on the morning of the 4th of May, that the Army of thePotomac was moving, evidently did not learn until about one o'clock inthe afternoon by what route we would confront his army.  This I judgefrom the fact that at 1.15 P.M., an hour and a quarter after Warren hadreached Old Wilderness Tavern, our officers took off rebel signalswhich, when translated, were seen to be an order to his troops to occupytheir intrenchments at Mine Run.Here at night dispatches were received announcing that Sherman, Butlerand Crook had moved according to programme.On discovering the advance of the Army of the Potomac, Lee ordered Hill,Ewell and Longstreet, each commanding corps, to move to the right toattack us, Hill on the Orange Plank Road, Longstreet to follow on thesame road.  Longstreet was at this time--middle of the afternoon--atGordonsville, twenty or more miles away.  Ewell was ordered by theOrange Pike.  He was near by and arrived some four miles east of MineRun before bivouacking for the night.My orders were given through General Meade for an early advance on themorning of the 5th.  Warren was to move to Parker's store, and Wilson'scavalry--then at Parker's store--to move on to Craig's meeting-house.Sedgwick followed Warren, closing in on his right.  The Army of thePotomac was facing to the west, though our advance was made to thesouth, except when facing the enemy.  Hancock was to move south-westwardto join on the left of Warren, his left to reach to Shady Grove Church.At six o'clock, before reaching Parker's store, Warren discovered theenemy.  He sent word back to this effect, and was ordered to halt andprepare to meet and attack him.  Wright, with his division of Sedgwick'scorps, was ordered, by any road he could find, to join on to Warren'sright, and Getty with his division, also of Sedgwick's corps, wasordered to move rapidly by Warren's rear and get on his left.  This wasthe speediest way to reinforce Warren who was confronting the enemy onboth the Orange plank and turnpike roads.Burnside had moved promptly on the 4th, on receiving word that the Armyof the Potomac had safely crossed the Rapidan.  By making a night march,although some of his troops had to march forty miles to reach the river,he was crossing with the head of his column early on the morning of the5th.  Meade moved his headquarters on to Old Wilderness Tavern, fourmiles south of the river, as soon as it was light enough to see theroad.  I remained to hasten Burnside's crossing and to put him inposition.  Burnside at this time was not under Meade's command, and washis senior in rank.  Getting information of the proximity of the enemy,I informed Meade, and without waiting to see Burnside, at once movedforward my headquarters to where Meade was.It was my plan then, as it was on all other occasions, to take theinitiative whenever the enemy could be drawn from his intrenchments ifwe were not intrenched ourselves.  Warren had not yet reached the pointwhere he was to halt, when he discovered the enemy near by.  Neitherparty had any advantage of position.  Warren was, therefore, ordered toattack as soon as he could prepare for it.  At nine o'clock Hancock wasordered to come up to the support of Getty.  He himself arrived atGetty's front about noon, but his troops were yet far in the rear.Getty was directed to hold his position at all hazards until relieved.About this hour Warren was ready, and attacked with favorable though notdecisive results.  Getty was somewhat isolated from Warren and was in aprecarious condition for a time.  Wilson, with his division of cavalry,was farther south, and was cut off from the rest of the army.  At twoo'clock Hancock's troops began to arrive, and immediately he was orderedto join Getty and attack the enemy.  But the heavy timber and narrowroads prevented him from getting into position for attack as promptly ashe generally did when receiving such orders.  At four o'clock he againreceived his orders to attack, and General Getty received orders fromMeade a few minutes later to attack whether Hancock was ready or not.He met the enemy under Heth within a few hundred yards.Hancock immediately sent two divisions, commanded by Birney and Mott,and later two brigades, Carroll's and Owen's, to the support of Getty.This was timely and saved Getty.  During the battle Getty and Carrollwere wounded, but remained on the field.  One of Birney's most gallantbrigade commanders--Alexander Hays--was killed.I had been at West Point with Hays for three years, and had served withhim through the Mexican war, a portion of the time in the same regiment.He was a most gallant officer, ready to lead his command whereverordered.  With him it was 'Come, boys,' not 'Go.'Wadsworth's division and Baxter's brigade of the 2d division were sentto reinforce Hancock and Getty; but the density of the interveningforest was such that, there being no road to march upon, they did notget up with the head of column until night, and bivouacked where theywere without getting into position.During the afternoon Sheridan sent Gregg's division of cavalry to Todd'sTavern in search of Wilson.  This was fortunate.  He found Wilsonengaged with a superior force under General Rosser, supported byinfantry, and falling back before it.  Together they were strong enoughto turn the tables upon the enemy and themselves become aggressive.They soon drove the rebel cavalry back beyond Corbin's Bridge.Fighting between Hancock and Hill continued until night put a close toit.  Neither side made any special progress.After the close of the battle of the 5th of May my orders were given forthe following morning.  We knew Longstreet with 12,000 men was on hisway to join Hill's right, near the Brock Road, and might arrive duringthe night.  I was anxious that the rebels should not take the initiativein the morning, and therefore ordered Hancock to make an assault at 4.30o'clock.  Meade asked to have the hour changed to six.  Deferring to hiswishes as far as I was willing, the order was modified and five wasfixed as the hour to move.Hancock had now fully one-half of the Army of the Potomac. Wadsworthwith his division, which had arrived the night before, lay in a lineperpendicular to that held by Hill, and to the right of Hancock.  He wasdirected to move at the same time, and to attack Hill's left.Burnside, who was coming up with two divisions, was directed to get inbetween Warren and Wadsworth, and attack as soon as he could get inposition to do so.  Sedgwick and Warren were to make attacks in theirfront, to detain as many of the enemy as they could and to takeadvantage of any attempt to reinforce Hill from that quarter.  Burnsidewas ordered if he should succeed in breaking the enemy's centre, toswing around to the left and envelop the right of Lee's army.  Hancockwas informed of all the movements ordered.Burnside had three divisions, but one of them--a colored division--wassent to guard the wagon train, and he did not see it again until July.Lee was evidently very anxious that there should be no battle on hisright until Longstreet got up.  This is evident from the fact thatnotwithstanding the early hour at which I had ordered the assault, bothfor the purpose of being the attacking party and to strike beforeLongstreet got up, Lee was ahead in his assault on our right.  Hispurpose was evident, but he failed.Hancock was ready to advance by the hour named, but learning in timethat Longstreet was moving a part of his corps by the Catharpin Road,thus threatening his left flank, sent a division of infantry, commandedby General Barlow, with all his artillery, to cover the approaches bywhich Longstreet was expected.  This disposition was made in time toattack as ordered.  Hancock moved by the left of the Orange Plank Road,and Wadsworth by the right of it. The fighting was desperate for aboutan hour, when the enemy began to break up in great confusion.I believed then, and see no reason to change that opinion now, that ifthe country had been such that Hancock and his command could have seenthe confusion and panic in the lines of the enemy, it would have beentaken advantage of so effectually that Lee would not have made anotherstand outside of his Richmond defences.Gibbon commanded Hancock's left, and was ordered to attack, but was notable to accomplish much.On the morning of the 6th Sheridan was sent to connect with Hancock'sleft and attack the enemy's cavalry who were trying to get on our leftand rear.  He met them at the intersection of the Furnace and Brockroads and at Todd's Tavern, and defeated them at both places.  Later hewas attacked, and again the enemy was repulsed.Hancock heard the firing between Sheridan and Stuart, and thinking theenemy coming by that road, still further reinforced his positionguarding the entrance to the Brock Road.  Another incident happenedduring the day to further induce Hancock to weaken his attacking column.Word reached him that troops were seen moving towards him from thedirection of Todd's Tavern, and Brooke's brigade was detached to meetthis new enemy; but the troops approaching proved to be several hundredconvalescents coming from Chancellorsville, by the road Hancock hadadvanced upon, to join their respective commands.  At 6.50 o'clock A.M.,Burnside, who had passed Wilderness Tavern at six o'clock, was orderedto send a division to the support of Hancock, but to continue with theremainder of his command in the execution of his previous order.  Thedifficulty of making a way through the dense forests prevented Burnsidefrom getting up in time to be of any service on the forenoon of thesixth.Hancock followed Hill's retreating forces, in the morning, a mile ormore.  He maintained this position until, along in the afternoon,Longstreet came upon him.  The retreating column of Hill meetingreinforcements that had not yet been engaged, became encouraged andreturned with them.  They were enabled, from the density of the forest,to approach within a few hundred yards of our advance before beingdiscovered.  Falling upon a brigade of Hancock's corps thrown to theadvance, they swept it away almost instantly.  The enemy followed up hisadvantage and soon came upon Mott's division, which fell back in greatconfusion.  Hancock made dispositions to hold his advanced position, butafter holding it for a time, fell back into the position that he hadheld in the morning, which was strongly intrenched.  In this engagementthe intrepid Wadsworth while trying to rally his men was mortallywounded and fell into the hands of the enemy.  The enemy followed up,but made no immediate attack.The Confederate General Jenkins was killed and Longstreet seriouslywounded in this engagement.  Longstreet had to leave the field, not toresume command for many weeks.  His loss was a severe one to Lee, andcompensated in a great measure for the mishap, or misapprehensions,which had fallen to our lot during the day.After Longstreet's removal from the field Lee took command of his rightin person.  He was not able, however, to rally his men to attackHancock's position, and withdrew from our front for the purpose ofreforming.  Hancock sent a brigade to clear his front of all remnantsthat might be left of Longstreet's or Hill's commands.  This brigadehaving been formed at right angles to the intrenchments held byHancock's command, swept down the whole length of them from left toright.  A brigade of the enemy was encountered in this move; but itbroke and disappeared without a contest.Firing was continued after this, but with less fury.  Burnside had notyet been able to get up to render any assistance.  But it was now onlyabout nine in the morning, and he was getting into position on Hancock'sright.At 4.15 in the afternoon Lee attacked our left.  His line moved up towithin a hundred yards of ours and opened a heavy fire. This status wasmaintained for about half an hour.  Then a part of Mott's division andWard's brigade of Birney's division gave way and retired in disorder.The enemy under R. H. Anderson took advantage of this and pushed throughour line, planting their flags on a part of the intrenchments not onfire.  But owing to the efforts of Hancock, their success was buttemporary.  Carroll, of Gibbon's division, moved at a double quick withhis brigade and drove back the enemy, inflicting great loss.  Fightinghad continued from five in the morning sometimes along the whole line,at other times only in places. The ground fought over had varied inwidth, but averaged three-quarters of a mile.  The killed, and many ofthe severely wounded, of both armies, lay within this belt where it wasimpossible to reach them.  The woods were set on fire by the burstingshells, and the conflagration raged.  The wounded who had not strengthto move themselves were either suffocated or burned to death.  Finallythe fire communicated with our breastworks, in places.  Beingconstructed of wood, they burned with great fury.  But the battle stillraged, our men firing through the flames until it became too hot toremain longer.Lee was now in distress.  His men were in confusion, and his personalefforts failed to restore order.  These facts, however, were learnedsubsequently, or we would have taken advantage of his condition and nodoubt gained a decisive success.  His troops were withdrawn now, but Irevoked the order, which I had given previously to this assault, forHancock to attack, because his troops had exhausted their ammunition anddid not have time to replenish from the train, which was at somedistance.Burnside, Sedgwick, and Warren had all kept up an assault during allthis time; but their efforts had no other effect than to prevent theenemy from reinforcing his right from the troops in their front.I had, on the 5th, ordered all the bridges over the Rapidan to be takenup except one at Germania Ford.The troops on Sedgwick's right had been sent to enforce our left.  Thisleft our right in danger of being turned, and us of being cut off fromall present base of supplies.  Sedgwick had refused his right andintrenched it for protection against attack.  But late in the afternoonof the 6th Early came out from his lines in considerable force and gotin upon Sedgwick's right, notwithstanding the precautions taken, andcreated considerable confusion.  Early captured several hundredprisoners, among them two general officers.  The defence, however, wasvigorous; and night coming on, the enemy was thrown into as muchconfusion as our troops, engaged, were.  Early says in his Memoirs thatif we had discovered the confusion in his lines we might have broughtfresh troops to his great discomfort.  Many officers, who had not beenattacked by Early, continued coming to my headquarters even afterSedgwick had rectified his lines a little farther to the rear, with newsof the disaster, fully impressed with the idea that the enemy waspushing on and would soon be upon me.During the night all of Lee's army withdrew within their intrenchments.On the morning of the 7th General Custer drove the enemy's cavalry fromCatharpin Furnace to Todd's Tavern. Pickets and skirmishers were sentalong our entire front to find the position of the enemy.  Some went asfar as a mile and a half before finding him. But Lee showed nodisposition to come out of his Works.  There was no battle during theday, and but little firing except in Warren's front; he being directedabout noon to make a reconnoissance in force.  This drew some sharpfiring, but there was no attempt on the part of Lee to drive him back.This ended the Battle of the Wilderness.
ISFP	 LI.AFTER THE BATTLE--TELEGRAPH AND SIGNAL SERVICE--MOVEMENT BY THE LEFTFLANK.More desperate fighting has not been witnessed on this continent thanthat of the 5th and 6th of May.  Our victory consisted in havingsuccessfully crossed a formidable stream, almost in the face of anenemy, and in getting the army together as a unit. We gained anadvantage on the morning of the 6th, which, if it had been followed up,must have proven very decisive.  In the evening the enemy gained anadvantage; but was speedily repulsed.  As we stood at the close, the twoarmies were relatively in about the same condition to meet each other aswhen the river divided them.  But the fact of having safely crossed wasa victory.Our losses in the Wilderness were very severe.  Those of theConfederates must have been even more so; but I have no means ofspeaking with accuracy upon this point.  The Germania Ford bridge wastransferred to Ely's Ford to facilitate the transportation of thewounded to Washington.It may be as well here as elsewhere to state two things connected withall movements of the Army of the Potomac:  first, in every change ofposition or halt for the night, whether confronting the enemy or not,the moment arms were stacked the men intrenched themselves.  For thispurpose they would build up piles of logs or rails if they could befound in their front, and dig a ditch, throwing the dirt forward on thetimber.  Thus the digging they did counted in making a depression tostand in, and increased the elevation in front of them.  It waswonderful how quickly they could in this way construct defences ofconsiderable strength.  When a halt was made with the view of assaultingthe enemy, or in his presence, these would be strengthened or theirpositions changed under the direction of engineer officers.  The secondwas, the use made of the telegraph and signal corps.  Nothing could bemore complete than the organization and discipline of this body of braveand intelligent men.  Insulated wires--insulated so that they wouldtransmit messages in a storm, on the ground or under water--were woundupon reels, making about two hundred pounds weight of wire to each reel.Two men and one mule were detailed to each reel.  The pack-saddle onwhich this was carried was provided with a rack like a sawbuck placedcrosswise of the saddle, and raised above it so that the reel, with itswire, would revolve freely.  There was a wagon, supplied with atelegraph operator, battery and telegraph instruments for each division,each corps, each army, and one for my headquarters.  There were wagonsalso loaded with light poles, about the size and length of a wall tESFJole, supplied with an iron spike in one end, used to hold the wires upwhen laid, so that wagons and artillery would not run over them.  Themules thus loaded were assigned to brigades, and always kept with thecommand they were assigned to.  The operators were also assigned toparticular headquarters, and never changed except by special orders.The moment the troops were put in position to go into camp all the menconnected with this branch of service would proceed to put up theirwires.  A mule loaded with a coil of wire would be led to the rear ofthe nearest flank of the brigade he belonged to, and would be led in aline parallel thereto, while one man would hold an end of the wire anduncoil it as the mule was led off.  When he had walked the length of thewire the whole of it would be on the ground.  This would be done in rearof every brigade at the same time.  The ends of all the wires would thenbe joined, making a continuous wire in the rear of the whole army.  Themen, attached to brigades or divisions, would all commence at onceraising the wires with their telegraph poles. This was done by making aloop in the wire and putting it over the spike and raising the pole to aperpendicular position.  At intervals the wire would be attached totrees, or some other permanent object, so that one pole was sufficientat a place. In the absence of such a support two poles would have to beused, at intervals, placed at an angle so as to hold the wire firm inits place.  While this was being done the telegraph wagons would taketheir positions near where the headquarters they belonged to were to beestablished, and would connect with the wire. Thus, in a few minuteslonger time than it took a mule to walk the length of its coil,telegraphic communication would be effected between all the headquartersof the army.  No orders ever had to be given to establish the telegraph.The signal service was used on the march.  The men composing this corpswere assigned to specified commands.  When movements were made, theywould go in advance, or on the flanks, and seize upon high points ofground giving a commanding view of the country, if cleared, or wouldclimb tall trees on the highest points if not cleared, and would denote,by signals, the positions of different parts of our own army, and oftenthe movements of the enemy.  They would also take off the signals of theenemy and transmit them.  It would sometimes take too long a time tomake translations of intercepted dispatches for us to receive anybenefit from them.  But sometimes they gave useful information.On the afternoon of the 7th I received news from Washington announcingthat Sherman had probably attacked Johnston that day, and that Butlerhad reached City Point safely and taken it by surprise on the 5th.  Ihad given orders for a movement by the left flank, fearing that Leemight move rapidly to Richmond to crush Butler before I could get there.My order for this movement was as follows:HEADQUARTERS ARMIES OF THE U. S., May 7, 1864, 6.30 A.M.MAJOR-GENERAL MEADE, Commanding A. P.Make all preparations during the day for a night march to take positionat Spottsylvania C. H. with one army corps, at Todd's Tavern with one,and another near the intersection of the Piney Branch and Spottsylvaniaroad with the road from Alsop's to Old Court House.  If this move ismade the trains should be thrown forward early in the morning to the NyRiver.I think it would be advisable in making the change to leave Hancockwhere he is until Warren passes him.  He could then follow and becomethe right of the new line.  Burnside will move to Piney Branch Church.Sedgwick can move along the pike to Chancellorsville and on to hisdestination.  Burnside will move on the plank road to the intersectionof it with the Orange and Fredericksburg plank road, then followSedgwick to his place of destination.All vehicles should be got out of hearing of the enemy before the troopsmove, and then move off quietly.It is more than probable that the enemy concentrate for a heavy attackon Hancock this afternoon.  In case they do we must be prepared toresist them, and follow up any success we may gain, with our wholeforce.  Such a result would necessarily modify these instructions.All the hospitals should be moved to-day to Chancellorsville.U. S. GRANT, Lieut.-General.During the 7th Sheridan had a fight with the rebel cavalry at Todd'sTavern, but routed them, thus opening the way for the troops that wereto go by that route at night.  Soon after dark Warren withdrew from thefront of the enemy, and was soon followed by Sedgwick.  Warren's marchcarried him immediately behind the works where Hancock's command lay onthe Brock Road.  With my staff and a small escort of cavalry I precededthe troops.  Meade with his staff accompanied me.  The greatestenthusiasm was manifested by Hancock's men as we passed by.  No doubt itwas inspired by the fact that the movement was south. It indicated tothem that they had passed through the 'beginning of the end' in thebattle just fought.  The cheering was so lusty that the enemy must havetaken it for a night attack.  At all events it drew from him a furiousfusillade of artillery and musketry, plainly heard but not felt by us.Meade and I rode in advance.  We had passed but a little way beyond ourleft when the road forked.  We looked to see, if we could, which roadSheridan had taken with his cavalry during the day.  It seemed to be theright-hand one, and accordingly we took it.  We had not gone far,however, when Colonel C. B. Comstock, of my staff, with the instinct ofthe engineer, suspecting that we were on a road that would lead us intothe lines of the enemy, if he, too, should be moving, dashed by at arapid gallop and all alone.  In a few minutes he returned and reportedthat Lee was moving, and that the road we were on would bring us intohis lines in a short distance.  We returned to the forks of the road,left a man to indicate the right road to the head of Warren's columnwhen it should come up, and continued our journey to Todd's Tavern,where we arrived after midnight.My object in moving to Spottsylvania was two-fold:  first, I did notwant Lee to get back to Richmond in time to attempt to crush Butlerbefore I could get there; second, I wanted to get between his army andRichmond if possible; and, if not, to draw him into the open field.  ButLee, by accident, beat us to Spottsylvania.  Our wagon trains had beenordered easterly of the roads the troops were to march upon before themovement commenced.  Lee interpreted this as a semi-retreat of the Armyof the Potomac to Fredericksburg, and so informed his government.Accordingly he ordered Longstreet's corps--now commanded by Anderson--tomove in the morning (the 8th) to Spottsylvania.  But the woods beingstill on fire, Anderson could not go into bivouac, and marched directlyon to his destination that night.  By this accident Lee got possessionof Spottsylvania.  It is impossible to say now what would have been theresult if Lee's orders had been obeyed as given; but it is certain thatwe would have been in Spottsylvania, and between him and his capital.My belief is that there would have been a race between the two armies tosee which could reach Richmond first, and the Army of the Potomac wouldhave had the shorter line.  Thus, twice since crossing the Rapidan wecame near closing the campaign, so far as battles were concerned, fromthe Rapidan to the James River or Richmond.  The first failure wascaused by our not following up the success gained over Hill's corps onthe morning of the 6th, as before described:  the second, when firescaused by that battle drove Anderson to make a march during the night ofthe 7th-8th which he was ordered to commence on the morning of the 8th.But accident often decides the fate of battle.Sheridan's cavalry had had considerable fighting during the afternoon ofthe 7th, lasting at Todd's Tavern until after night, with the field hisat the close.  He issued the necessary orders for seizing Spottsylvaniaand holding the bridge over the Po River, which Lee's troops would haveto cross to get to Spottsylvania.  But Meade changed Sheridan's ordersto Merritt--who was holding the bridge--on his arrival at Todd's Tavern,and thereby left the road free for Anderson when he came up.  Wilson,who was ordered to seize the town, did so, with his division of cavalry;but he could not hold it against the Confederate corps which had notbeen detained at the crossing of the Po, as it would have been but forthe unfortunate change in Merritt's orders.  Had he been permitted toexecute the orders Sheridan gave him, he would have been guarding withtwo brigades of cavalry the bridge over the Po River which Anderson hadto cross, and must have detained him long enough to enable Warren toreinforce Wilson and hold the town.Anderson soon intrenched himself--if indeed the intrenchments were notalready made--immediately across Warren's front. Warren was not aware ofhis presence, but probably supposed it was the cavalry which Merritt hadengaged earlier in the day. He assaulted at once, but was repulsed.  Hesoon organized his men, as they were not pursued by the enemy, and madea second attack, this time with his whole corps.  This time he succeededin gaining a position immediately in the enemy's front, where heintrenched.  His right and left divisions--the former Crawford's, thelatter Wadsworth's, now commanded by Cutler--drove the enemy back somedistance.At this time my headquarters had been advanced to Piney Branch Church.I was anxious to crush Anderson before Lee could get a force to hissupport.  To this end Sedgwick who was at Piney Branch Church, wasordered to Warren's support.  Hancock, who was at Todd's Tavern, wasnotified of Warren's engagement, and was directed to be in readiness tocome up.  Burnside, who was with the wagon trains at Aldrich's on ourextreme left, received the same instructions.  Sedgwick was slow ingetting up for some reason--probably unavoidable, because he was neverat fault when serious work was to be done--so that it was near nightbefore the combined forces were ready to attack.  Even then all ofSedgwick's command did not get into the engagement.  Warren led the lastassault, one division at a time, and of course it failed.Warren's difficulty was twofold:  when he received an order to doanything, it would at once occur to his mind how all the balance of thearmy should be engaged so as properly to co-operate with him.  His ideaswere generally good, but he would forget that the person giving himorders had thought of others at the time he had of him.  In like manner,when he did get ready to execute an order, after giving most intelligentinstructions to division commanders, he would go in with one division,holding the others in reserve until he could superintend their movementsin person also, forgetting that division commanders could execute anorder without his presence.  His difficulty was constitutional andbeyond his control.  He was an officer of superior ability, quickperceptions, and personal courage to accomplish anything that could bedone with a small command.Lee had ordered Hill's corps--now commanded by Early--to move by thevery road we had marched upon.  This shows that even early in themorning of the 8th Lee had not yet become acquainted with my move, butstill thought that the Army of the Potomac had gone to Fredericksburg.Indeed, he informed the authorities at Richmond he had possession ofSpottsylvania and was on my flank. Anderson was in possession ofSpottsylvania, through no foresight of Lee, however.  Early only foundthat he had been following us when he ran against Hancock at Todd'sTavern.  His coming detained Hancock from the battle-field ofSpottsylvania for that day; but he, in like manner, kept Early back andforced him to move by another route.Had I ordered the movement for the night of the 7th by my left flank, itwould have put Hancock in the lead.  It would also have given us an houror earlier start.  It took all that time for Warren to get the head ofhis column to the left of Hancock after he had got his troops out oftheir line confronting the enemy.  This hour, and Hancock's capacity touse his whole force when necessary, would, no doubt, have enabled him tocrush Anderson before he could be reinforced.  But the movement made wastactical.  It kept the troops in mass against a possible assault by theenemy.  Our left occupied its intrenchments while the two corps to theright passed.  If an attack had been made by the enemy he would havefound the 2d corps in position, fortified, and, practically, the 5th and6th corps in position as reserves, until his entire front was passed.By a left flank movement the army would have been scattered while stillpassing the front of the enemy, and before the extreme right had got byit would have been very much exposed.  Then, too, I had not yet learnedthe special qualifications of the different corps commanders.  At thattime my judgment was that Warren was the man I would suggest to succeedMeade should anything happen to that gallant soldier to take him fromthe field.  As I have before said, Warren was a gallant soldier, an ableman; and he was beside thoroughly imbued with the solemnity andimportance of the duty he had to perform.
ISFP	 LII.BATTLE OF SPOTTSYLVANIA--HANCOCK'S POSITION--ASSAULT OF WARREN'S ANDWRIGHT'S CORPS--UPTON PROMOTED ON THE FIELD--GOOD NEWS FROM BUTLER ANDSHERIDAN.The Mattapony River is formed by the junction of the Mat, the Ta, the Poand the Ny rivers, the last being the northernmost of the four.  Ittakes its rise about a mile south and a little east of the WildernessTavern.  The Po rises south-west of the place, but farther away.Spottsylvania is on the ridge dividing these two streams, and where theyare but a few miles apart.  The Brock Road reaches Spottsylvania withoutcrossing either of these streams. Lee's army coming up by the CatharpinRoad, had to cross the Po at Wooden Bridge.  Warren and Hancock came bythe Brock Road.  Sedgwick crossed the Ny at Catharpin Furnace. Burnsidecoming by Aldrich's to Gates's house, had to cross the Ny near theenemy.  He found pickets at the bridge, but they were soon driven off bya brigade of Willcox's division, and the stream was crossed.  Thisbrigade was furiously attacked; but the remainder of the division comingup, they were enabled to hold their position, and soon fortified it.About the time I received the news of this attack, word came fromHancock that Early had left his front.  He had been forced over to theCatharpin Road, crossing the Po at Corbin's and again at Wooden Bridge.These are the bridges Sheridan had given orders to his cavalry to occupyon the 8th, while one division should occupy Spottsylvania.  Thesemovements of the enemy gave me the idea that Lee was about to make theattempt to get to, or towards, Fredericksburg to cut off my supplies.  Imade arrangements to attack his right and get between him and Richmondif he should try to execute this design.  If he had any such intentionit was abandoned as soon as Burnside was established south of the Ny.The Po and the Ny are narrow little streams, but deep, with abruptbanks, and bordered by heavily wooded and marshy bottoms--at the time wewere there--and difficult to cross except where bridged.  The countryabout was generally heavily timbered, but with occasional clearings.  Itwas a much better country to conduct a defensive campaign in than anoffensive one.By noon of the 9th the position of the two armies was as follows:  Leeoccupied a semicircle facing north, north-west and north-east, inclosingthe town.  Anderson was on his left extending to the Po, Ewell camenext, then Early.  Warren occupied our right, covering the Brock andother roads converging at Spottsylvania; Sedgwick was to his left andBurnside on our extreme left.  Hancock was yet back at Todd's Tavern,but as soon as it was known that Early had left Hancock's front thelatter was ordered up to Warren's right.  He formed a line with threedivisions on the hill overlooking the Po early in the afternoon, and wasordered to cross the Po and get on the enemy's flank.  The fourthdivision of Hancock's corps, Mott commanding, was left at Todd's whenthe corps first came up; but in the afternoon it was brought up andplaced to the left of Sedgwick's--now Wright's--6th corps.  In themorning General Sedgwick had been killed near the right of hisintrenchments by rebel sharpshooters.  His loss was a severe one to theArmy of the Potomac and to the Nation.  General H. G. Wright succeededhim in the command of his corps.Hancock was now, nine P.M. of the 9th of May, across the left flank ofLee's army, but separated from it, and also from the remainder ofMeade's army, by the Po River.  But for the lateness of the hour and thedarkness of the night he would have attempted to cross the river againat Wooden Bridge, thus bringing himself on the same side with bothfriend and foe.The Po at the points where Hancock's corps crossed runs nearly due east.Just below his lower crossing--the troops crossed at three points--itturns due south, and after passing under Wooden Bridge soon resumes amore easterly direction.  During the night this corps built threebridges over the Po; but these were in rear.The position assumed by Hancock's corps forced Lee to reinforce his leftduring the night.  Accordingly on the morning of the 10th, when Hancockrenewed his effort to get over the Po to his front, he found himselfconfronted by some of Early's command, which had been brought from theextreme right of the enemy during the night.  He succeeded in effectinga crossing with one brigade, however, but finding the enemy intrenchedin his front, no more were crossed.Hancock reconnoitred his front on the morning of the 10th, with the viewof forcing a crossing, if it was found that an advantage could begained.  The enemy was found strongly intrenched on the high groundoverlooking the river, and commanding the Wooden Bridge with artillery.Anderson's left rested on the Po, where it turns south; therefore, forHancock to cross over--although it would bring him to the same side ofthe stream with the rest of the army--would still farther isolate himfrom it.  The stream would have to be crossed twice in the face of theenemy to unite with the main body.  The idea of crossing was thereforeabandoned.Lee had weakened the other parts of his line to meet this movement ofHancock's, and I determined to take advantage of it.  Accordingly in themorning, orders were issued for an attack in the afternoon on the centreby Warren's and Wright's corps, Hancock to command all the attackingforce.  Two of his divisions were brought to the north side of the Po.Gibbon was placed to the right of Warren, and Birney in his rear as areserve.  Barlow's division was left south of the stream, and Mott ofthe same corps was still to the left of Wright's corps.  Burnside wasordered to reconnoitre his front in force, and, if an opportunitypresented, to attack with vigor.  The enemy seeing Barlow's divisionisolated from the rest of the army, came out and attacked with fury.Barlow repulsed the assault with great slaughter, and with considerableloss to himself.  But the enemy reorganized and renewed the assault.Birney was now moved to the high ground overlooking the river crossingsbuilt by our troops, and covered the crossings.  The second assault wasrepulsed, again with severe loss to the enemy, and Barlow was withdrawnwithout further molestation. General T. G. Stevenson was killed in thismove.Between the lines, where Warren's assault was to take place, there was aravine grown up with large trees and underbrush, making it almostimpenetrable by man.  The slopes on both sides were also covered with aheavy growth of timber.  Warren, before noon, reconnoitred his fronttwice, the first time with one and the second with two divisions.  Hewas repulsed on both occasions, but gained such information of theground as to induce him to report recommending the assault.Wright also reconnoitred his front and gained a considerably advancedposition from the one he started from.  He then organized a stormingparty, consisting of twelve regiments, and assigned Colonel Emory Upton,of the 121st New York Volunteers, to the command of it.  About fouro'clock in the afternoon the assault was ordered, Warren's and Wright'scorps, with Mott's division of Hancock's corps, to move simultaneously.The movement was prompt, and in a few minutes the fiercest of strugglesbegan.  The battle-field was so densely covered with forest that butlittle could be seen, by any one person, as to the progress made.  Meadeand I occupied the best position we could get, in rear of Warren.Warren was repulsed with heavy loss, General J. C. Rice being among thekilled.  He was not followed, however, by the enemy, and was therebyenabled to reorganize his command as soon as covered from the guns ofthe enemy.  To the left our success was decided, but the advantage waslost by the feeble action of Mott.  Upton with his assaulting partypushed forward and crossed the enemy's intrenchments.  Turning to theright and left he captured several guns and some hundreds of prisoners.Mott was ordered to his assistance but failed utterly.  So much time waslost in trying to get up the troops which were in the right position toreinforce, that I ordered Upton to withdraw; but the officers and men ofhis command were so averse to giving up the advantage they had gainedthat I withdrew the order.  To relieve them, I ordered a renewal of theassault.  By this time Hancock, who had gone with Birney's division torelieve Barlow, had returned, bringing the division with him.  His corpswas now joined with Warren's and Wright's in this last assault.  It wasgallantly made, many men getting up to, and over, the works of theenemy; but they were not able to hold them.  At night they werewithdrawn.  Upton brought his prisoners with him, but the guns he hadcaptured he was obliged to abandon.  Upton had gained an importantadvantage, but a lack in others of the spirit and dash possessed by himlost it to us.  Before leaving Washington I had been authorized topromote officers on the field for special acts of gallantry.  By thisauthority I conferred the rank of brigadier-general upon Upton on thespot, and this act was confirmed by the President.  Upton had been badlywounded in this fight.Burnside on the left had got up to within a few hundred yards ofSpottsylvania Court House, completely turning Lee's right.  He was notaware of the importance of the advantage he had gained, and I, beingwith the troops where the heavy fighting was, did not know of it at thetime.  He had gained his position with but little fighting, and almostwithout loss.  Burnside's position now separated him widely fromWright's corps, the corps nearest to him.  At night he was ordered tojoin on to this.  This brought him back about a mile, and lost to us animportant advantage.  I attach no blame to Burnside for this, but I doto myself for not having had a staff officer with him to report to mehis position.The enemy had not dared to come out of his line at any point to followup his advantage, except in the single instance of his attack on Barlow.Then he was twice repulsed with heavy loss, though he had an entirecorps against two brigades.  Barlow took up his bridges in the presenceof this force.On the 11th there was no battle and but little firing; none except byMott who made a reconnoissance to ascertain if there was a weak point inthe enemy's line.I wrote the following letter to General Halleck:NEAR SPOTTSYLVANIA C. H., May 11, 1864--8.30 A.M.MAJOR-GENERAL HALLECK, Chief of Staff of the Army, Washington, D. C.We have now ended the 6th day of very hard fighting.  The result up tothis time is much in our favor.  But our losses have been heavy as wellas those of the enemy.  We have lost to this time eleven generalofficers killed, wounded and missing, and probably twenty thousand men.I think the loss of the enemy must be greater--we having taken over fourthousand prisoners in battle, whilst he has taken from us but few excepta few stragglers.  I am now sending back to Belle Plain all my wagonsfor a fresh supply of provisions and ammunition, and purpose to fight itout on this line if it takes all summer.The arrival of reinforcements here will be very encouraging to the men,and I hope they will be sent as fast as possible, and in as greatnumbers.  My object in having them sent to Belle Plain was to use themas an escort to our supply trains.  If it is more convenient to sendthem out by train to march from the railroad to Belle Plain orFredericksburg, send them so.I am satisfied the enemy are very shaky, and are only kept up to themark by the greatest exertions on the part of their officers, and bykeeping them intrenched in every position they take.Up to this time there is no indication of any portion of Lee's armybeing detached for the defence of Richmond.U. S. GRANT, Lieut.-General.And also, I received information, through the War Department, fromGeneral Butler that his cavalry under Kautz had cut the railroad southof Petersburg, separating Beauregard from Richmond, and had whippedHill, killing, wounding and capturing many.  Also that he wasintrenched, and could maintain himself.  On this same day came news fromSheridan to the effect that he had destroyed ten miles of the railroadand telegraph between Lee and Richmond, one and a half million rations,and most of the medical stores for his army.On the 8th I had directed Sheridan verbally to cut loose from the Armyof the Potomac and pass around the left of Lee's army and attack hiscavalry and communications, which was successfully executed in themanner I have already described.
ISFP	 LIII.HANCOCK'S ASSAULT-LOSSES OF THE CONFEDERATES--PROMOTIONS RECOMMENDED--DISCOMFITURE OF THE ENEMY--EWELL'S ATTACK-REDUCING THE ARTILLERY.In the reconnoissance made by Mott on the 11th, a salient was discoveredat the right centre. I determined that an assault should be made at thatpoint. (*28) Accordingly in the afternoon Hancock was ordered to movehis command by the rear of Warren and Wright, under cover of night, toWright's left, and there form it for an assault at four o'clock the nextmorning.  The night was dark, it rained heavily, and the road wasdifficult, so that it was midnight when he reached the point where hewas to halt.  It took most of the night to get the men in position fortheir advance in the morning.  The men got but little rest.  Burnsidewas ordered to attack (*29) on the left of the salient at the same hour.I sent two of my staff officers to impress upon him the importance ofpushing forward vigorously.  Hancock was notified of this.  Warren andWright were ordered to hold themselves in readiness to join in theassault if circumstances made it advisable.  I occupied a centralposition most convenient for receiving information from all points.Hancock put Barlow on his left, in double column, and Birney to hisright.  Mott followed Birney, and Gibbon was held in reserve.The morning of the 12th opened foggy, delaying the start more than halfan hour.The ground over which Hancock had to pass to reach the enemy, wasascending and heavily wooded to within two or three hundred yards of theenemy's intrenchments.  In front of Birney there was also a marsh tocross.  But, notwithstanding all these difficulties, the troops pushedon in quick time without firing a gun, and when within four or fivehundred yards of the enemy's line broke out in loud cheers, and with arush went up to and over the breastworks.  Barlow and Birney enteredalmost simultaneously.  Here a desperate hand-to-hand conflict tookplace.  The men of the two sides were too close together to fire, butused their guns as clubs.  The hand conflict was soon over.  Hancock'scorps captured some four thousand prisoners among them a division and abrigade commander twenty or more guns with their horses, caissons, andammunition, several thousand stand of arms, and many colors.  Hancock,as soon as the hand-to-hand conflict was over, turned the guns of theenemy against him and advanced inside the rebel lines.  About sixo'clock I ordered Warren's corps to the support of Hancock's. Burnside,on the left, had advanced up east of the salient to the very parapet ofthe enemy.  Potter, commanding one of his divisions, got over but wasnot able to remain there.  However, he inflicted a heavy loss upon theenemy; but not without loss in return.This victory was important, and one that Lee could not afford to leaveus in full possession of.  He made the most strenuous efforts to regainthe position he had lost.  Troops were brought up from his left andattacked Hancock furiously.  Hancock was forced to fall back:  but hedid so slowly, with his face to the enemy, inflicting on him heavy loss,until behind the breastworks he had captured.  These he turned, facingthem the other way, and continued to hold.  Wright was ordered up toreinforce Hancock, and arrived by six o'clock.  He was wounded soonafter coming up but did not relinquish the command of his corps,although the fighting lasted until one o'clock the next morning.  Ateight o'clock Warren was ordered up again, but was so slow in making hisdispositions that his orders were frequently repeated, and withemphasis.  At eleven o'clock I gave Meade written orders to relieveWarren from his command if he failed to move promptly. Hancock placedbatteries on high ground in his rear, which he used against the enemy,firing over the heads of his own troops.Burnside accomplished but little on our left of a positive nature, butnegatively a great deal.  He kept Lee from reinforcing his centre fromthat quarter.  If the 5th corps, or rather if Warren, had been as promptas Wright was with the 6th corps, better results might have beenobtained.Lee massed heavily from his left flank on the broken point of his line.Five times during the day he assaulted furiously, but without dislodgingour troops from their new position.  His losses must have been fearful.Sometimes the belligerents would be separated by but a few feet.  In oneplace a tree, eighteen inches in diameter, was cut entirely down bymusket balls.  All the trees between the lines were very much cut topieces by artillery and musketry.  It was three o'clock next morningbefore the fighting ceased.  Some of our troops had then been twentyhours under fire.  In this engagement we did not lose a singleorganization, not even a company.  The enemy lost one division with itscommander, one brigade and one regiment, with heavy losseselsewhere.(*30)  Our losses were heavy, but, as stated, no whole companywas captured.  At night Lee took a position in rear of his former one,and by the following morning he was strongly intrenched in it.Warren's corps was now temporarily broken up, Cutler's division sent toWright, and Griffin's to Hancock.  Meade ordered his chief of staff,General Humphreys, to remain with Warren and the remaining division, andauthorized him to give it orders in his name.During the day I was passing along the line from wing to wingcontinuously.  About the centre stood a house which proved to beoccupied by an old lady and her daughter.  She showed such unmistakablesigns of being strongly Union that I stopped.  She said she had not seena Union flag for so long a time that it did her heart good to look uponit again.  She said her husband and son, being, Union men, had had toleave early in the war, and were now somewhere in the Union army, ifalive.  She was without food or nearly so, so I ordered rations issuedto her, and promised to find out if I could where the husband and sonwere.There was no fighting on the 13th, further than a little skirmishingbetween Mott's division and the enemy.  I was afraid that Lee might bemoving out, and I did not want him to go without my knowing it. Theindications were that he was moving, but it was found that he was onlytaking his new position back from the salient that had been captured.Our dead were buried this day.  Mott's division was reduced to abrigade, and assigned to Birney's division.During this day I wrote to Washington recommending Sherman and Meade(*31) for promotion to the grade of Major-General in the regular army;Hancock for Brigadier-General; Wright, Gibbon and Humphreys to beMajor-Generals of Volunteers; and Upton and Carroll to be Brigadiers.Upton had already been named as such, but the appointment had to beconfirmed by the Senate on the nomination of the President.The night of the 13th Warren and Wright were moved by the rear to theleft of Burnside.  The night was very dark and it rained heavily, theroads were so bad that the troops had to cut trees and corduroy the roada part of the way, to get through.  It was midnight before they got tothe point where they were to halt, and daylight before the troops couldbe organized to advance to their position in line.  They gained theirposition in line, however, without any fighting, except a little inWright's front.  Here Upton had to contend for an elevation which wewanted and which the enemy was not disposed to yield.  Upton first drovethe enemy, and was then repulsed in turn.  Ayres coming to his supportwith his brigade (of Griffin's division, Warren's corps), the positionwas secured and fortified.  There was no more battle during the 14th.This brought our line east of the Court House and running north andsouth and facing west.During the night of the 14th-15th Lee moved to cover this new front.This left Hancock without an enemy confronting him.  He was brought tothe rear of our new centre, ready to be moved in any direction he mightbe wanted.On the 15th news came from Butler and Averill.  The former reported thecapture of the outer works at Drury's Bluff, on the James River, andthat his cavalry had cut the railroad and telegraph south of Richmond onthe Danville road:  and the latter, the destruction of a depot ofsupplies at Dublin, West Virginia, and the breaking of New River Bridgeon the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad.  The next day news came fromSherman and Sheridan.  Sherman had forced Johnston out of Dalton,Georgia, and was following him south.  The report from Sheridan embracedhis operations up to his passing the outer defences of Richmond.  Theprospect must now have been dismal in Richmond. The road and telegraphwere cut between the capital and Lee. The roads and wires were cut inevery direction from the rebel capital.  Temporarily that city was cutoff from all communication with the outside except by courier.  Thiscondition of affairs, however, was of but short duration.I wrote Halleck:NEAR SPOTTSYLVANIA C. H., May 16, 1864, 8 A.M.MAJOR-GENERAL HALLECK, Washington, D. C.:We have had five days almost constant rain without any prospect yet ofit clearing up.  The roads have now become so impassable that ambulanceswith wounded men can no longer run between here and Fredericksburg.  Alloffensive operations necessarily cease until we can have twenty-fourhours of dry weather.  The army is in the best of spirits, and feel thegreatest confidence of ultimate success. *        *        *        **        * You can assure the President and Secretary of War that theelements alone have suspended hostilities, and that it is in no mannerdue to weakness or exhaustion on our part.U. S. GRANT, Lieut.-General.The condition of the roads was such that nothing was done on the 17th.But that night Hancock and Wright were to make a night march back totheir old positions, and to make an assault at four o'clock in themorning.  Lee got troops back in time to protect his old line, so theassault was unsuccessful.  On this day (18th) the news was almost asdiscouraging to us as it had been two days before in the rebel capital.As stated above, Hancock's and Wright's corps had made an unsuccessfulassault. News came that Sigel had been defeated at New Market, badly,and was retreating down the valley.  Not two hours before, I had sentthe inquiry to Halleck whether Sigel could not get to Staunton to stopsupplies coming from there to Lee.  I asked at once that Sigel might berelieved, and some one else put in his place. Hunter's name wassuggested, and I heartily approved.  Further news from Butler reportedhim driven from Drury's Bluff, but still in possession of the Petersburgroad.  Banks had been defeated in Louisiana, relieved, and Canby put inhis place. This change of commander was not on my suggestion.  All thisnews was very discouraging.  All of it must have been known by the enemybefore it was by me.  In fact, the good news (for the enemy) must havebeen known to him at the moment I thought he was in despair, and hisanguish had been already relieved when we were enjoying his supposeddiscomfiture, But this was no time for repining.  I immediately gaveorders for a movement by the left flank, on towards Richmond, tocommence on the night of the 19th.  I also asked Halleck to secure thecooperation of the navy in changing our base of supplies fromFredericksburg to Port Royal, on the Rappahannock.Up to this time I had received no reinforcements, except six thousandraw troops under Brigadier General Robert O. Tyler, just arrived.  Theyhad not yet joined their command, Hancock's corps, but were on ourright.  This corps had been brought to the rear of the centre, ready tomove in any direction.  Lee, probably suspecting some move on my part,and seeing our right entirely abandoned, moved Ewell's corps about fiveo'clock in the afternoon, with Early's as a reserve, to attack us inthat quarter.  Tyler had come up from Fredericksburg, and had beenhalted on the road to the right of our line, near Kitching's brigade ofWarren's corps.  Tyler received the attack with his raw troops, and theymaintained their position, until reinforced, in a manner worthy ofveterans.Hancock was in a position to reinforce speedily, and was the soldier todo it without waiting to make dispositions.  Birney was thrown toTyler's right and Crawford to his left, with Gibbon as a reserve; andEwell was whirled back speedily and with heavy loss.Warren had been ordered to get on Ewell's flank and in his rear, to cuthim off from his intrenchments.  But his efforts were so feeble thatunder the cover of night Ewell got back with only the loss of a fewhundred prisoners, besides his killed and wounded.  The army beingengaged until after dark, I rescinded the order for the march by ourleft flank that night.As soon as it was discovered that the enemy were coming out to attack, Inaturally supposed they would detach a force to destroy our trains.  Thewithdrawal of Hancock from the right uncovered one road fromSpottsylvania to Fredericksburg over which trains drew our supplies.This was guarded by a division of colored troops, commanded by GeneralFerrero, belonging to Burnside's corps.  Ferrero was therefore promptlynotified, and ordered to throw his cavalry pickets out to the south andbe prepared to meet the enemy if he should come; if he had to retreat todo so towards Fredericksburg.  The enemy did detach as expected, andcaptured twenty-five or thirty wagons which, however, were soon retaken.In consequence of the disasters that had befallen us in the past fewdays, Lee could be reinforced largely, and I had no doubt he would be.Beauregard had come up from the south with troops to guard theConfederate capital when it was in danger.  Butler being driven back,most of the troops could be sent to Lee. Hoke was no longer needed inNorth Carolina; and Sigel's troops having gone back to Cedar Creek,whipped, many troops could be spared from the valley.The Wilderness and Spottsylvania battles convinced me that we had moreartillery than could ever be brought into action at any one time.  Itoccupied much of the road in marching, and taxed the trains in bringingup forage.  Artillery is very useful when it can be brought into action,but it is a very burdensome luxury where it cannot be used.  Beforeleaving Spottsylvania, therefore, I sent back to the defences ofWashington over one hundred pieces of artillery, with the horses andcaissons.  This relieved the roads over which we were to march of morethan two hundred six-horse teams, and still left us more artillery thancould be advantageously used.  In fact, before reaching the James RiverI again reduced the artillery with the army largely.I believed that, if one corps of the army was exposed on the road toRichmond, and at a distance from the main army, Lee would endeavor toattack the exposed corps before reinforcements could come up; in whichcase the main army could follow Lee up and attack him before he had timeto intrench.  So I issued the following orders:NEAR SPOTTSYLVANIA C. H., VA., May 18, 1864.MAJOR-GENERAL MEADE, Commanding Army of the Potomac.Before daylight to-morrow morning I propose to draw Hancock and Burnsidefrom the position they now hold, and put Burnside to the left of Wright.Wright and Burnside should then force their way up as close to the enemyas they can get without a general engagement, or with a generalengagement if the enemy will come out of their works to fight, andintrench.  Hancock should march and take up a position as if in supportof the two left corps. To-morrow night, at twelve or one o'clock, hewill be moved south-east with all his force and as much cavalry as canbe given to him, to get as far towards Richmond on the line of theFredericksburg Railroad as he can make, fighting the enemy in whateverforce he can find him.  If the enemy make a general move to meet this,they will be followed by the other three corps of the army, andattacked, if possible, before time is given to intrench.Suitable directions will at once be given for all trains and surplusartillery to conform to this movement.U. S. GRANT.On the 20th, Lee showing no signs of coming out of his lines, orderswere renewed for a left-flank movement, to commence after night.
ISFP	 LIV.MOVEMENT BY THE LEFT FLANK--BATTLE OF NORTH ANNA--AN INCIDENT OF THEMARCH--MOVING ON RICHMOND--SOUTH OF THE PAMUNKEY--POSITION OF THENATIONAL ARMY.We were now to operate in a different country from any we had beforeseen in Virginia.  The roads were wide and good, and the country wellcultivated.  No men were seen except those bearing arms, even the blackman having been sent away.  The country, however, was new to us, and wehad neither guides nor maps to tell us where the roads were, or wherethey led to.  Engineer and staff officers were put to the dangerous dutyof supplying the place of both maps and guides.  By reconnoitring theywere enabled to locate the roads in the vicinity of each army corps.Our course was south, and we took all roads leading in that directionwhich would not separate the army too widely.Hancock who had the lead had marched easterly to Guiney's Station, onthe Fredericksburg Railroad, thence southerly to Bowling Green andMilford.  He was at Milford by the night of the 21st.  Here he met adetachment of Pickett's division coming from Richmond to reinforce Lee.They were speedily driven away, and several hundred captured.  Warrenfollowed on the morning of the 21st, and reached Guiney's Station thatnight without molestation.  Burnside and Wright were retained atSpottsylvania to keep up the appearance of an intended assault, and tohold Lee, if possible, while Hancock and Warren should get start enoughto interpose between him and Richmond.Lee had now a superb opportunity to take the initiative either byattacking Wright and Burnside alone, or by following by the TelegraphRoad and striking Hancock's and Warren's corps, or even Hancock's alone,before reinforcements could come up.  But he did not avail himself ofeither opportunity.  He seemed really to be misled as to my designs; butmoved by his interior line--the Telegraph Road--to make sure of keepingbetween his capital and the Army of the Potomac.  He never again hadsuch an opportunity of dealing a heavy blow.The evening of the 21st Burnside, 9th corps, moved out followed byWright, 6th corps.  Burnside was to take the Telegraph Road; but findingStanard's Ford, over the Po, fortified and guarded, he turned east tothe road taken by Hancock and Warren without an attempt to dislodge theenemy.  The night of the 21st I had my headquarters near the 6th corps,at Guiney's Station, and the enemy's cavalry was between us and Hancock.There was a slight attack on Burnside's and Wright's corps as they movedout of their lines; but it was easily repulsed.  The object probably wasonly to make sure that we were not leaving a force to follow upon therear of the Confederates.By the morning of the 22d Burnside and Wright were at Guiney's Station.Hancock's corps had now been marching and fighting continuously forseveral days, not having had rest even at night much of the time.  Theywere, therefore, permitted to rest during the 22d.  But Warren waspushed to Harris's Store, directly west of Milford, and connected withit by a good road, and Burnside was sent to New Bethel Church.  Wright'scorps was still back at Guiney's Station.I issued the following order for the movement of the troops the nextday:NEW BETHEL, VA., May 22, 1864MAJOR-GENERAL MEADE, Commanding Army of the Potomac.Direct corps commanders to hold their troops in readiness to march atfive A.M. to-morrow.  At that hour each command will send out cavalryand infantry on all roads to their front leading south, and ascertain,if possible, where the enemy is. If beyond the South Anna, the 5th and6th corps will march to the forks of the road, where one branch leads toBeaver Dam Station, the other to Jericho Bridge, then south by roadsreaching the Anna, as near to and east of Hawkins Creek as they can befound.The 2d corps will move to Chesterfield Ford.  The 9th corps will bedirected to move at the same time to Jericho Bridge.  The map only showstwo roads for the four corps to march upon, but, no doubt, by the use ofplantation roads, and pressing in guides, others can be found, to giveone for each corps.The troops will follow their respective reconnoitring parties. Thetrains will be moved at the same time to Milford Station.Headquarters will follow the 9th corps.U. S. GRANT, Lieut.-General.Warren's corps was moved from Harris's Store to Jericho Ford, Wright'sfollowing.  Warren arrived at the ford early in the afternoon, and byfive o'clock effected a crossing under the protection of sharpshooters.The men had to wade in water up to their waists.  As soon as enoughtroops were over to guard the ford, pontoons were laid and the artilleryand the rest of the troops crossed.  The line formed was almostperpendicular to the course of the river--Crawford on the left, next tothe river, Griffin in the centre, and Cutler on the right.  Lee wasfound intrenched along the front of their line.  The whole of Hill'scorps was sent against Warren's right before it had got in position.  Abrigade of Cutler's division was driven back, the enemy following, butassistance coming up the enemy was in turn driven back into his trencheswith heavy loss in killed and wounded, with about five hundred prisonersleft in our hands. By night Wright's corps was up ready to reinforceWarren.On the 23d Hancock's corps was moved to the wooden bridge which spansthe North Anna River just west of where the Fredericksburg Railroadcrosses.  It was near night when the troops arrived. They found thebridge guarded, with troops intrenched, on the north side.  Hancock senttwo brigades, Egan's and Pierce's, to the right and left, and whenproperly disposed they charged simultaneously.  The bridge was carriedquickly, the enemy retreating over it so hastily that many were shovedinto the river, and some of them were drowned.  Several hundredprisoners were captured.  The hour was so late that Hancock did notcross until next morning.Burnside's corps was moved by a middle road running between thosedescribed above, and which strikes the North Anna at Ox Ford, midwaybetween Telegraph Road and Jericho Ford.  The hour of its arrival wastoo late to cross that night.On the 24th Hancock's corps crossed to the south side of the riverwithout opposition, and formed line facing nearly west. The railroad inrear was taken possession of and destroyed as far as possible.  Wright'scorps crossed at Jericho early the same day, and took position to theright of Warren's corps, extending south of the Virginia CentralRailroad.  This road was torn up for a considerable distance to the rear(west), the ties burned, and the rails bent and twisted by heating themover the burning ties.  It was found, however, that Burnside's corpscould not cross at Ox Ford.  Lee had taken a position with his centre onthe river at this point, with the two wings thrown back, his line makingan acute angle where it overlooked the river.Before the exact position of the whole of Lee's line was accuratelyknown, I directed Hancock and Warren each to send a brigade to Ox Fordby the south side of the river.  They found the enemy too strong tojustify a serious attack.  A third ford was found between Ox Ford andJericho.  Burnside was directed to cross a division over this ford, andto send one division to Hancock.  Crittenden was crossed by thisnewly-discovered ford, and formed up the river to connect withCrawford's left.  Potter joined Hancock by way of the wooden bridge.Crittenden had a severe engagement with some of Hill's corps on hiscrossing the river, and lost heavily.  When joined to Warren's corps hewas no further molested.  Burnside still guarded Ox Ford from the northside.Lee now had his entire army south of the North Anna.  Our lines coveredhis front, with the six miles separating the two wings guarded by but asingle division.  To get from one wing to the other the river would haveto be crossed twice.  Lee could reinforce any part of his line from allpoints of it in a very short march; or could concentrate the whole of itwherever he might choose to assault.  We were, for the time, practicallytwo armies besieging.Lee had been reinforced, and was being reinforced, largely. About thistime the very troops whose coming I had predicted, had arrived or werecoming in.  Pickett with a full division from Richmond was up; Hoke fromNorth Carolina had come with a brigade; and Breckinridge was there:  inall probably not less than fifteen thousand men.  But he did not attemptto drive us from the field.On the 22d or 23d I received dispatches from Washington saying thatSherman had taken Kingston, crossed the Etowah River and was advancinginto Georgia.I was seated at the time on the porch of a fine plantation house waitingfor Burnside's corps to pass.  Meade and his staff, besides my ownstaff, were with me.  The lady of the house, a Mrs. Tyler, and anelderly lady, were present.  Burnside seeing us, came up on the porch,his big spurs and saber rattling as he walked.  He touched his hatpolitely to the ladies, and remarked that he supposed they had neverseen so many 'live Yankees' before in their lives.  The elderly ladyspoke up promptly saying, 'Oh yes, I have; many more.'  'Where?' saidBurnside. 'In Richmond.'  Prisoners, of course, was understood.I read my dispatch aloud, when it was received.  This threw the youngerlady into tears. I found the information she had received (and I supposeit was the information generally in circulation through the South) wasthat Lee was driving us from the State in the most demoralized conditionand that in the South-west our troops were but little better thanprisoners of war.  Seeing our troops moving south was ocular proof thata part of her information was incorrect, and she asked me if my newsfrom Sherman was true.  I assured her that there was no doubt about it.I left a guard to protect the house from intrusion until the troopsshould have all passed, and assured her that if her husband was inhiding she could bring him in and he should be protected also.  But Ipresume he was in the Confederate army.On the 25th I gave orders, through Halleck, to Hunter, who had relievedSigel, to move up the Valley of Virginia, cross over the Blue Ridge toCharlottesville and go as far as Lynchburg if possible, living upon thecountry and cutting the railroads and canal as he went.  After doingthis he could find his way back to his base, or join me.On the same day news was received that Lee was falling back on Richmond.This proved not to be true.  But we could do nothing where we wereunless Lee would assume the offensive. I determined, therefore, to drawout of our present position and make one more effort to get between himand Richmond.  I had no expectation now, however, of succeeding in this;but I did expect to hold him far enough west to enable me to reach theJames River high up.  Sheridan was now again with the Army of thePotomac.On the 26th I informed the government at Washington of the position ofthe two armies; of the reinforcements the enemy had received; of themove I proposed to make (*32); and directed that our base of suppliesshould be shifted to White House, on the Pamunkey.  The wagon train andguards moved directly from Port Royal to White House.  Supplies movedaround by water, guarded by the navy.  Orders had previously been sent,through Halleck, for Butler to send Smith's corps to White House.  Thisorder was repeated on the 25th, with directions that they should belanded on the north side of the Pamunkey, and marched until they joinedthe Army of the Potomac.It was a delicate move to get the right wing of the Army of the Potomacfrom its position south of the North Anna in the presence of the enemy.To accomplish it, I issued the following order:QUARLES' MILLS, VA., May 25, 1864.MAJOR GENERAL MEADE, Commanding A. P.Direct Generals Warren and Wright to withdraw all their teams andartillery, not in position, to the north side of the river to-morrow.Send that belonging to General Wright's corps as far on the road toHanover Town as it can go, without attracting attention to the fact.Send with it Wright's best division or division under his ablestcommander.  Have their places filled up in the line so if possible theenemy will not notice their withdrawal.  Send the cavalry to-morrowafternoon, or as much of it as you may deem necessary, to watch andseize, if they can, Littlepage's Bridge and Taylor's Ford, and to remainon one or other side of the river at these points until the infantry andartillery all pass.  As soon as it is dark to-morrow night start thedivision which you withdraw first from Wright's corps to make a forcedmarch to Hanover Town, taking with them no teams to impede their march.At the same time this division starts commence withdrawing all of the5th and 6th corps from the south side of the river, and march them forthe same place.  The two divisions of the 9th corps not now withHancock, may be moved down the north bank of the river where they willbe handy to support Hancock if necessary, or will be that much on theirroad to follow the 5th and 6th corps.  Hancock should hold his commandin readiness to follow as soon as the way is clear for him. To-morrow itwill leave nothing for him to do, but as soon as he can he should getall his teams and spare artillery on the road or roads which he willhave to take.  As soon as the troops reach Hanover Town they should getpossession of all the crossings they can in that neighborhood.  I thinkit would be well to make a heavy cavalry demonstration on the enemy'sleft, to-morrow afternoon, also.U. S. GRANT, Lieut.-General.Wilson's division of cavalry was brought up from the left and moved byour right south to Little River.  Here he manoeuvred to give theimpression that we were going to attack the left flank of Lee's army.Under cover of night our right wing was withdrawn to the north side ofthe river, Lee being completely deceived by Wilson's feint.  On theafternoon of the 26th Sheridan moved, sending Gregg's and Torbert'scavalry to Taylor's and Littlepage's fords towards Hanover.  As soon asit was dark both divisions moved quietly to Hanover Ferry, leaving smallguards behind to keep up the impression that crossings were to beattempted in the morning.  Sheridan was followed by a division ofinfantry under General Russell.  On the morning of the 27th the crossingwas effected with but little loss, the enemy losing thirty or forty,taken prisoners.  Thus a position was secured south of the Pamunkey.Russell stopped at the crossing while the cavalry pushed on to HanoverTown.  Here Barringer's, formerly Gordon's, brigade of rebel cavalry wasencountered, but it was speedily driven away.Warren's and Wright's corps were moved by the rear of Burnside's andHancock's corps.  When out of the way these latter corps followed,leaving pickets confronting the enemy.  Wilson's cavalry followed last,watching all the fords until everything had recrossed; then taking upthe pontoons and destroying other bridges, became the rear-guard.Two roads were traversed by the troops in this move.  The one nearest toand north of the North Anna and Pamunkey was taken by Wright, followedby Hancock.  Warren, followed by Burnside, moved by a road farthernorth, and longer.  The trains moved by a road still farther north, andhad to travel a still greater distance.  All the troops that had crossedthe Pamunkey on the morning of the 27th remained quiet during the restof the day, while the troops north of that stream marched to reach thecrossing that had been secured for them.Lee had evidently been deceived by our movement from North Anna; for onthe morning of the 27th he telegraphed to Richmond: 'Enemy crossed tonorth side, and cavalry and infantry crossed at Hanover Town.'  Thetroops that had then crossed left his front the night of the 25th.The country we were now in was a difficult one to move troops over.  Thestreams were numerous, deep and sluggish, sometimes spreading out intoswamps grown up with impenetrable growths of trees and underbrush.  Thebanks were generally low and marshy, making the streams difficult toapproach except where there were roads and bridges.Hanover Town is about twenty miles from Richmond.  There are two roadsleading there; the most direct and shortest one crossing theChickahominy at Meadow Bridge, near the Virginia Central Railroad, thesecond going by New and Old Cold Harbor.  A few miles out from HanoverTown there is a third road by way of Mechanicsville to Richmond.  NewCold Harbor was important to us because while there we both covered theroads back to White House (where our supplies came from), and the roadssouth-east over which we would have to pass to get to the James Riverbelow the Richmond defences.On the morning of the 28th the army made an early start, and by noon allhad crossed except Burnside's corps.  This was left on the north sidetemporarily to guard the large wagon train.  A line was at once formedextending south from the river, Wright's corps on the right, Hancock'sin the centre, and Warren's on the left, ready to meet the enemy if heshould come.At the same time Sheridan was directed to reconnoitre towardsMechanicsville to find Lee's position.  At Hawes' Shop, just where themiddle road leaves the direct road to Richmond, he encountered theConfederate cavalry dismounted and partially intrenched.  Gregg attackedwith his division, but was unable to move the enemy.  In the eveningCuster came up with a brigade. The attack was now renewed, the cavalrydismounting and charging as infantry.  This time the assault wassuccessful, both sides losing a considerable number of men.  But ourtroops had to bury the dead, and found that more Confederate than Unionsoldiers had been killed.  The position was easily held, because ourinfantry was near.On the 29th a reconnoissance was made in force, to find the position ofLee.  Wright's corps pushed to Hanover Court House.  Hancock's corpspushed toward Totopotomoy Creek; Warren's corps to the left on the ShadyGrove Church Road, while Burnside was held in reserve. Our advance waspushed forward three miles on the left with but little fighting.  Therewas now an appearance of a movement past our left flank, and Sheridanwas sent to meet it.On the 30th Hancock moved to the Totopotomoy, where he found the enemystrongly fortified.  Wright was moved to the right of Hancock's corps,and Burnside was brought forward and crossed, taking position to theleft of Hancock.  Warren moved up near Huntley Corners on the ShadyGrove Church Road.  There was some skirmishing along the centre, and inthe evening Early attacked Warren with some vigor, driving him back atfirst, and threatening to turn our left flank.  As the best means ofreinforcing the left, Hancock was ordered to attack in his front.  Hecarried and held the rifle-pits.  While this was going on Warren got hismen up, repulsed Early, and drove him more than a mile.On this day I wrote to Halleck ordering all the pontoons in Washingtonto be sent to City Point.In the evening news was received of the arrival of Smith with his corpsat White House.  I notified Meade, in writing, as follows:NEAR HAWES' SHOP, VA., 6.40 P.M., May 30, 1864.MAJOR-GENERAL MEADE, Commanding A. P.General Smith will debark his force at the White House tonight and startup the south bank of the Pamunkey at an early hour, probably at 3 A.M.in the morning.  It is not improbable that the enemy, being aware ofSmith's movement, will be feeling to get on our left flank for thepurpose of cutting him off, or by a dash to crush him and get backbefore we are aware of it. Sheridan ought to be notified to watch theenemy's movements well out towards Cold Harbor, and also on theMechanicsville road.  Wright should be got well massed on Hancock'sright, so that, if it becomes necessary, he can take the place of thelatter readily whilst troops are being thrown east of the Totopotomoy ifnecessary.I want Sheridan to send a cavalry force of at least half a brigade, ifnot a whole brigade, at 5 A.M. in the morning, to communicate with Smithand to return with him.  I will send orders for Smith by the messengeryou send to Sheridan with his orders.U. S. GRANT.I also notified Smith of his danger, and the precautions that would betaken to protect him.The night of the 30th Lee's position was substantially from Atlee'sStation on the Virginia Central Railroad south and east to the vicinityof Cold Harbor.  Ours was:  The left of Warren's corps was on the ShadyGrove Road, extending to the Mechanicsville Road and about three milessouth of the Totopotomoy.  Burnside to his right, then Hancock, andWright on the extreme right, extending towards Hanover Court House, sixmiles south-east of it.  Sheridan with two divisions of cavalry waswatching our left front towards Cold Harbor.  Wilson with his divisionon our right was sent to get on the Virginia Central Railroad anddestroy it as far back as possible.  He got possession of Hanover CourtHouse the next day after a skirmish with Young's cavalry brigade.  Theenemy attacked Sheridan's pickets, but reinforcements were sent up andthe attack was speedily repulsed and the enemy followed some distancetowards Cold Harbor.
ISFP	 LV.ADVANCE ON COLD HARBOR--AN ANECDOTE OF THE WAR--BATTLE OF COLD HARBOR--CORRESPONDENCE WITH LEE--RETROSPECTIVE.On the 31st Sheridan advanced to near Old Cold Harbor.  He found itintrenched and occupied by cavalry and infantry.  A hard fight ensuedbut the place was carried.  The enemy well knew the importance of ColdHarbor to us, and seemed determined that we should not hold it.  Hereturned with such a large force that Sheridan was about withdrawingwithout making any effort to hold it against such odds; but about thetime he commenced the evacuation he received orders to hold the place atall hazards, until reinforcements could be sent to him.  He speedilyturned the rebel works to face against them and placed his men inposition for defence.  Night came on before the enemy was ready forassault.Wright's corps was ordered early in the evening to march directly toCold Harbor passing by the rear of the army.  It was expected to arriveby daylight or before; but the night was dark and the distance great, sothat it was nine o'clock the 1st of June before it reached itsdestination.  Before the arrival of Wright the enemy had made twoassaults on Sheridan, both of which were repulsed with heavy loss to theenemy.  Wright's corps coming up, there was no further assault on ColdHarbor.Smith, who was coming up from White House, was also directed to marchdirectly to Cold Harbor, and was expected early on the morning of the1st of June; but by some blunder the order which reached Smith directedhim to Newcastle instead of Cold Harbor.  Through this blunder Smith didnot reach his destination until three o'clock in the afternoon, and thenwith tired and worn-out men from their long and dusty march.  He landedtwelve thousand five hundred men from Butler's command, but a divisionwas left at White House temporarily and many men had fallen out of ranksin their long march.Before the removal of Wright's corps from our right, after dark on the31st, the two lines, Federal and Confederate, were so close together atthat point that either side could detect directly any movement made bythe other.  Finding at daylight that Wright had left his front, Leeevidently divined that he had gone to our left.  At all events, soonafter light on the 1st of June Anderson, who commanded the corps onLee's left, was seen moving along Warren's front.  Warren was ordered toattack him vigorously in flank, while Wright was directed to move outand get on his front.  Warren fired his artillery at the enemy; but lostso much time in making ready that the enemy got by, and at three o'clockhe reported the enemy was strongly intrenched in his front, and besideshis lines were so long that he had no mass of troops to move with.  Heseemed to have forgotten that lines in rear of an army hold themselveswhile their defenders are fighting in their front.  Wright reconnoitredsome distance to his front:  but the enemy finding Old Cold Harboralready taken had halted and fortified some distance west.By six o'clock in the afternoon Wright and Smith were ready to make anassault.  In front of both the ground was clear for several hundredyards and then became wooded.  Both charged across this open space andinto the wood, capturing and holding the first line of rifle-pits of theenemy, and also capturing seven or eight hundred prisoners.While this was going on, the enemy charged Warren three separate timeswith vigor, but were repulsed each time with loss.  There was no officermore capable, nor one more prompt in acting, than Warren when the enemyforced him to it.  There was also an attack upon Hancock's andBurnside's corps at the same time; but it was feeble and probably onlyintended to relieve Anderson who was being pressed by Wright and Smith.During the night the enemy made frequent attacks with the view ofdispossessing us of the important position we had gained, but withouteffecting their object.Hancock was moved from his place in line during the night and ordered tothe left of Wright.  I expected to take the offensive on the morning ofthe 2d, but the night was so dark, the heat and dust so excessive andthe roads so intricate and hard to keep, that the head of column onlyreached Old Cold Harbor at six o'clock, but was in position at 7.30 A.M.Preparations were made for an attack in the afternoon, but did not takeplace until the next morning.  Warren's corps was moved to the left toconnect with Smith:  Hancock's corps was got into position to the leftof Wright's, and Burnside was moved to Bethesda Church in reserve. WhileWarren and Burnside were making these changes the enemy came out severaltimes and attacked them, capturing several hundred prisoners.  Theattacks were repulsed, but not followed up as they should have been.  Iwas so annoyed at this that I directed Meade to instruct his corpscommanders that they should seize all such opportunities when theyoccurred, and not wait for orders, all of our manoeuvres being made forthe very purpose of getting the enemy out of his cover.On this day Wilson returned from his raid upon the Virginia CentralRailroad, having damaged it considerably.  But, like ourselves, therebels had become experts in repairing such damage.  Sherman, in hismemoirs, relates an anecdote of his campaign to Atlanta that wellillustrates this point.  The rebel cavalry lurking in his rear to burnbridges and obstruct his communications had become so disgusted athearing trains go whistling by within a few hours after a bridge hadbeen burned, that they proposed to try blowing up some of the tunnels.One of them said, 'No use, boys, Old Sherman carries duplicate tunnelswith him, and will replace them as fast as you can blow them up; bettersave your powder.'Sheridan was engaged reconnoitring the banks of the Chickahominy, tofind crossings and the condition of the roads.  He reported favorably.During the night Lee moved his left up to make his line correspond toours.  His lines extended now from the Totopotomoy to New Cold Harbor.Mine from Bethesda Church by Old Cold Harbor to the Chickahominy, with adivision of cavalry guarding our right.  An assault was ordered for the3d, to be made mainly by the corps of Hancock, Wright and Smith; butWarren and Burnside were to support it by threatening Lee's left, and toattack with great earnestness if he should either reinforce morethreatened points by drawing from that quarter or if a favorableopportunity should present itself.The corps commanders were to select the points in their respectivefronts where they would make their assaults.  The move was to commenceat half-past four in the morning.  Hancock sent Barlow and Gibbonforward at the appointed hour, with Birney as a reserve.  Barlow pushedforward with great vigor, under a heavy fire of both artillery andmusketry, through thickets and swamps.  Notwithstanding all theresistance of the enemy and the natural obstructions to overcome, hecarried a position occupied by the enemy outside their main line wherethe road makes a deep cut through a bank affording as good a shelter fortroops as if it had been made for that purpose.  Three pieces ofartillery had been captured here, and several hundred prisoners.  Theguns were immediately turned against the men who had just been usingthem.  No (*33) assistance coming to him, he (Barlow) intrenched underfire and continued to hold his place.  Gibbon was not so fortunate inhis front.  He found the ground over which he had to pass cut up withdeep ravines, and a morass difficult to cross.  But his men struggled onuntil some of them got up to the very parapet covering the enemy.Gibbon gained ground much nearer the enemy than that which he left, andhere he intrenched and held fast.Wright's corps moving in two lines captured the outer rifle-pits intheir front, but accomplished nothing more.  Smith's corps also gainedthe outer rifle-pits in its front.  The ground over which this corps(18th) had to move was the most exposed of any over which charges weremade.  An open plain intervened between the contending forces at thispoint, which was exposed both to a direct and a cross fire.  Smith,however, finding a ravine running towards his front, sufficiently deepto protect men in it from cross fire, and somewhat from a direct fire,put Martindale's division in it, and with Brooks supporting him on theleft and Devens on the right succeeded in gaining the outer--probablypicket--rifle-pits.  Warren and Burnside also advanced and gainedground--which brought the whole army on one line.This assault cost us heavily and probably without benefit to compensate:but the enemy was not cheered by the occurrence sufficiently to inducehim to take the offensive.  In fact, nowhere after the battle of theWilderness did Lee show any disposition to leave his defences far behindhim.Fighting was substantially over by half-past seven in the morning.  Ateleven o'clock I started to visit all the corps commanders to see formyself the different positions gained and to get their opinion of thepracticability of doing anything more in their respective fronts.Hancock gave the opinion that in his front the enemy was too strong tomake any further assault promise success.  Wright thought he could gainthe lines of the enemy, but it would require the cooperation ofHancock's and Smith's corps.  Smith thought a lodgment possible, but wasnot sanguine:  Burnside thought something could be done in his front,but Warren differed.  I concluded, therefore to make no more assaults,and a little after twelve directed in the following letter that alloffensive action should cease.COLD HARBOR, June 3, 1864.-12.30 P.M. MAJOR-GENERAL MEADE,Commanding A. P.The opinion of corps commanders not being sanguine of success in case anassault is ordered, you may direct a suspension of farther advance forthe present.  Hold our most advanced positions and strengthen them.Whilst on the defensive our line may be contracted from the right ifpracticable.Reconnoissances should be made in front of every corps and advances madeto advantageous positions by regular approaches. To aid the expeditionunder General Hunter it is necessary that we should detain all the armynow with Lee until the former gets well on his way to Lynchburg.  To dothis effectually it will be better to keep the enemy out of theintrenchments of Richmond than to have them go back there.Wright and Hancock should be ready to assault in case the enemy shouldbreak through General Smith's lines, and all should be ready to resistan assault.U. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General.The remainder of the day was spent in strengthening the line we nowheld.  By night we were as strong against Lee as he was against us.During the night the enemy quitted our right front, abandoning some oftheir wounded, and without burying their dead.  These we were able tocare for.  But there were many dead and wounded men between the lines ofthe contending forces, which were now close together, who could not becared for without a cessation of hostilities.So I wrote the following:COLD HARBOR, VA., June 5, 1864.GENERAL R.  E. LEE, Commanding Confederate Army.It is reported to me that there are wounded men, probably of botharmies, now lying exposed and suffering between the lines occupiedrespectively by the two armies.  Humanity would dictate that someprovision should be made to provide against such hardships.  I wouldpropose, therefore, that hereafter, when no battle is raging, eitherparty be authorized to send to any point between the pickets or skirmishlines, unarmed men bearing litters to pick up their dead or wounded,without being fired upon by the other party.  Any other method, equallyfair to both parties, you may propose for meeting the end desired willbe accepted by me.U. S. GRANT, Lieut.-General.Lee replied that he feared such an arrangement would lead tomisunderstanding, and proposed that in future, when either party wishedto remove their dead and wounded, a flag of truce be sent.  I answeredthis immediately by saying:COLD HARBOR, VA., June 6, 1864.GENERAL R. E. LEE, Commanding Army of N. Va.Your communication of yesterday's date is received.  I will sendimmediately, as you propose, to collect the dead and wounded between thelines of the two armies, and will also instruct that you be allowed todo the same.  I propose that the time for doing this be between thehours of 12 M. and 3 P.M. to-day.  I will direct all parties going outto bear a white flag, and not to attempt to go beyond where we have deador wounded, and not beyond or on ground occupied by your troops.U. S. GRANT, Lieut.-General.Lee's response was that he could not consent to the burial of the deadand removal of the wounded in the way I proposed, but when either partydesired such permission it should be asked for by flag of truce and hehad directed that any parties I may have sent out, as mentioned in myletter, to be turned back.  I answered:COLD HARBOR, VA, June 6, 1864.GENERAL R. E. LEE. Commanding Army, N. Va.The knowledge that wounded men are now suffering from want of attention,between the two armies, compels me to ask a suspension of hostilitiesfor sufficient time to collect them in, say two hours.  Permit me to saythat the hours you may fix upon for this will be agreeable to me, andthe same privilege will be extended to such parties as you may wish tosend out on the same duty without further application.U. S. GRANT, Lieut.-General.Lee acceded to this; but delays in transmitting the correspondencebrought it to the 7th of June--forty-eight hours after it commenced--before parties were got out to collect the men left upon the field.In the meantime all but two of the wounded had died.  And I wrote toLee:COLD HARBOR, VA., June 7, 1864. 10.30 A.M.GEN. R. E. LEE, Commanding Army of N. Va.I regret that your note of seven P.M. yesterday should have beenreceived at the nearest corps headquarters, to where it was delivered,after the hour which had been given for the removal of the dead andwounded had expired; 10.45 P.M. was the hour at which it was received atcorps headquarters, and between eleven and twelve it reached myheadquarters.  As a consequence, it was not understood by the troops ofthis army that there was a cessation of hostilities for the purpose ofcollecting the dead and wounded, and none were collected.  Two officersand six men of the 8th and 25th North Carolina Regts., who were out insearch of the bodies of officers of their respective regiments, werecaptured and brought into our lines, owing to this want ofunderstanding.  I regret this, but will state that as soon as I learnedthe fact, I directed that they should not be held as prisoners, but mustbe returned to their commands.  These officers and men having beencarelessly brought through our lines to the rear have not determinedwhether they will be sent back the way they came, or whether they willbe sent by some other route.Regretting that all my efforts for alleviating the sufferings of woundedmen left upon the battle-field have been rendered nugatory, I remain,&c.,U. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General.I have always regretted that the last assault at Cold Harbor was evermade.  I might say the same thing of the assault of the 22d of May,1863, at Vicksburg.  At Cold Harbor no advantage whatever was gained tocompensate for the heavy loss we sustained.  Indeed, the advantagesother than those of relative losses, were on the Confederate side.Before that, the Army of Northern Virginia seemed to have acquired awholesome regard for the courage, endurance, and soldierly qualitiesgenerally of the Army of the Potomac.  They no longer wanted to fightthem 'one Confederate to five Yanks.'  Indeed, they seemed to have givenup any idea of gaining any advantage of their antagonist in the openfield.  They had come to much prefer breastworks in their front to theArmy of the Potomac.  This charge seemed to revive their hopestemporarily; but it was of short duration.  The effect upon the Army ofthe Potomac was the reverse.  When we reached the James River, however,all effects of the battle of Cold Harbor seemed to have disappeared.There was more justification for the assault at Vicksburg.  We were in aSouthern climate, at the beginning of the hot season.  The Army of theTennessee had won five successive victories over the garrison ofVicksburg in the three preceding weeks.  They had driven a portion ofthat army from Port Gibson with considerable loss, after having flankedthem out of their stronghold at Grand Gulf.  They had attacked anotherportion of the same army at Raymond, more than fifty miles farther inthe interior of the State, and driven them back into Jackson with greatloss in killed, wounded, captured and missing, besides loss of large andsmall arms:  they had captured the capital of the State of Mississippi,with a large amount of materials of war and manufactures.  Only a fewdays before, they had beaten the enemy then penned up in the town firstat Champion's Hill, next at Big Black River Bridge, inflicting upon hima loss of fifteen thousand or more men (including those cut off fromreturning) besides large losses in arms and ammunition.  The Army of theTennessee had come to believe that they could beat their antagonistunder any circumstances.  There was no telling how long a regular siegemight last.  As I have stated, it was the beginning of the hot season ina Southern climate.  There was no telling what the casualties might beamong Northern troops working and living in trenches, drinking surfacewater filtered through rich vegetation, under a tropical sun.  IfVicksburg could have been carried in May, it would not only have savedthe army the risk it ran of a greater danger than from the bullets ofthe enemy, but it would have given us a splendid army, well equipped andofficered, to operate elsewhere with. These are reasons justifying theassault.  The only benefit we gained--and it was a slight one for sogreat a sacrifice--was that the men worked cheerfully in the trenchesafter that, being satisfied with digging the enemy out.  Had the assaultnot been made, I have no doubt that the majority of those engaged in thesiege of Vicksburg would have believed that had we assaulted it wouldhave proven successful, and would have saved life, health and comfort.
ISFP	 LVI.LEFT FLANK MOVEMENT ACROSS THE CHICKAHOMINY AND JAMES--GENERAL LEE--VISIT TO BUTLER--THE MOVEMENT ON PETERSBURG--THE INVESTMENT OFPETERSBURG.Lee's position was now so near Richmond, and the intervening swamps ofthe Chickahominy so great an obstacle to the movement of troops in theface of an enemy, that I determined to make my next left flank movecarry the Army of the Potomac south of the James River. (*34)Preparations for this were promptly commenced. The move was a hazardousone to make:  the Chickahominy River, with its marshy and heavilytimbered approaches, had to be crossed; all the bridges over it east ofLee were destroyed; the enemy had a shorter line and better roads totravel on to confront me in crossing; more than fifty miles intervenedbetween me and Butler, by the roads I should have to travel, with boththe James and the Chickahominy unbridged to cross; and last, the Army ofthe Potomac had to be got out of a position but a few hundred yards fromthe enemy at the widest place.  Lee, if he did not choose to follow me,might, with his shorter distance to travel and his bridges over theChickahominy and the James, move rapidly on Butler and crush him beforethe army with me could come to his relief.  Then too he might sparetroops enough to send against Hunter who was approaching Lynchburg,living upon the country he passed through, and without ammunitionfurther than what he carried with him.But the move had to be made, and I relied upon Lee's not seeing mydanger as I saw it.  Besides we had armies on both sides of the JamesRiver and not far from the Confederate capital.  I knew that its safetywould be a matter of the first consideration with the executive,legislative and judicial branches of the so-called Confederategovernment, if it was not with the military commanders.  But I took allthe precaution I knew of to guard against all dangers.Sheridan was sent with two divisions, to communicate with Hunter and tobreak up the Virginia Central Railroad and the James River Canal, on the7th of June, taking instructions to Hunter to come back with him (*35).Hunter was also informed by way of Washington and the Valley thatSheridan was on the way to meet him.  The canal and Central Road, andthe regions penetrated by them, were of vast importance to the enemy,furnishing and carrying a large per cent. of all the supplies for theArmy of Northern Virginia and the people of Richmond.  Before Sheridangot off on the 7th news was received from Hunter reporting his advanceto Staunton and successful engagement with the enemy near that place onthe 5th, in which the Confederate commander, W. S. Jones, was killed.On the 4th of June the enemy having withdrawn his left corps, Burnsideon our right was moved up between Warren and Smith.  On the 5th Birneyreturned to Hancock, which extended his left now to the Chickahominy,and Warren was withdrawn to Cold Harbor.  Wright was directed to sendtwo divisions to the left to extend down the banks of that stream toBottom's Bridge.  The cavalry extended still farther east to Jones'sBridge.On the 7th Abercrombie--who was in command at White House, and who hadbeen in command at our base of supplies in all the changes made from thestart--was ordered to take up the iron from the York River Railroad andput it on boats, and to be in readiness to move by water to City Point.On the 8th Meade was directed to fortify a line down the bankoverlooking the Chickahominy, under cover of which the army could move.On the 9th Abercrombie was directed to send all organized troopsarriving at White House, without debarking from their transports, toreport to Butler.  Halleck was at this time instructed to send allreinforcements to City Point.On the 11th I wrote:COLD HARBOR, VA., June 11, 1864.MAJOR-GEN. B. F. BUTLER, Commanding Department of Va. and N. C.The movement to transfer this army to the south side of the James Riverwill commence after dark to-morrow night.  Col. Comstock, of my staff,was sent specially to ascertain what was necessary to make your positionsecure in the interval during which the enemy might use most of hisforce against you, and also, to ascertain what point on the river weshould reach to effect a crossing if it should not be practicable toreach this side of the river at Bermuda Hundred.  Colonel Comstock hasnot yet returned, so that I cannot make instructions as definite as Iwould wish, but the time between this and Sunday night being so short inwhich to get word to you, I must do the best I can.  Colonel Dent goesto the Chickahominy to take to you the 18th corps.  The corps will leaveits position in the trenches as early in the evening, tomorrow, aspossible, and make a forced march to Cole's Landing or Ferry, where itshould reach by ten A.M. the following morning.  This corps numbers now15,300 men.  They take with them neither wagons nor artillery; theselatter marching with the balance of the army to the James River.  Theremainder of the army will cross the Chickahominy at Long Bridge and atJones's, and strike the river at the most practicable crossing belowCity Point.I directed several days ago that all reinforcements for the army shouldbe sent to you.  I am not advised of the number that may have gone, butsuppose you have received from six to ten thousand.  General Smith willalso reach you as soon as the enemy could, going by the way of Richmond.The balance of the force will not be more than one day behind, unlessdetained by the whole of Lee's army, in which case you will be strongenough.I wish you would direct the proper staff officers, your chief-engineerand your chief-quartermaster, to commence at once the collection of allthe means in their reach for crossing the army on its arrival.  If thereis a point below City Point where a pontoon bridge can be thrown, haveit laid.Expecting the arrival of the 18th corps by Monday night, if you deem itpracticable from the force you have to seize and hold Petersburg, youmay prepare to start, on the arrival of troops to hold your presentlines.  I do not want Petersburg visited, however, unless it is held,nor an attempt to take it, unless you feel a reasonable degree ofconfidence of success.  If you should go there, I think troops shouldtake nothing with them except what they can carry, depending uponsupplies being sent after the place is secured.  If Colonel Dent shouldnot succeed in securing the requisite amount of transportation for the18th corps before reaching you, please have the balance supplied.U. S. GRANT, Lieut.-General.P. S.--On reflection I will send the 18th corps by way of White House.The distance which they will have to march will be enough shorter toenable them to reach you about the same time, and the uncertainty ofnavigation on the Chickahominy will be avoided.U. S. GRANT.COLD HARBOR, VA., June 11,1864.MAJOR-GENERAL G. G. MEADE, Commanding Army of the Potomac.Colonel Comstock, who visited the James River for the purpose ofascertaining the best point below Bermuda Hundred to which to march thearmy has not yet returned.  It is now getting so late, however, that allpreparations may be made for the move to-morrow night without waitinglonger.The movement will be made as heretofore agreed upon, that is, the 18thcorps make a rapid march with the infantry alone, their wagons andartillery accompanying the balance of the army to Cole's Landing orFerry, and there embark for City Point, losing no time for rest untilthey reach the latter point.The 5th corps will seize Long Bridge and move out on the Long BridgeRoad to its junction with Quaker Road, or until stopped by the enemy.The other three corps will follow in such order as you may direct, oneof them crossing at Long Bridge, and two at Jones's Bridge.  After thecrossing is effected, the most practicable roads will be taken to reachabout Fort Powhattan.  Of course, this is supposing the enemy makes noopposition to our advance.  The 5th corps, after securing the passage ofthe balance of the army, will join or follow in rear of the corps whichcrosses the same bridge with themselves.  The wagon trains should bekept well east of the troops, and if a crossing can be found, or madelower down than Jones's they should take it.U. S. GRANT, Lieut.-General.P. S.--In view of the long march to reach Cole's Landing, and theuncertainty of being able to embark a large number of men there, thedirection of the 18th corps may be changed to White House.  They shouldbe directed to load up transports, and start them as fast as loadedwithout waiting for the whole corps or even whole divisions to gotogether.U. S. GRANT.About this time word was received (through the Richmond papers of the11th) that Crook and Averell had united and were moving east.  This,with the news of Hunter's successful engagement near Staunton, was nodoubt known to Lee before it was to me. Then Sheridan leaving with twodivisions of cavalry, looked indeed threatening, both to Lee'scommunications and supplies. Much of his cavalry was sent afterSheridan, and Early with Ewell's entire corps was sent to the Valley.Supplies were growing scarce in Richmond, and the sources from which todraw them were in our hands.  People from outside began to pour intoRichmond to help eat up the little on hand.  Consternation reignedthere.On the 12th Smith was ordered to move at night to White House, not tostop until he reached there, and to take boats at once for City Point,leaving his trains and artillery to move by land.Soon after dark some of the cavalry at Long Bridge effected a crossingby wading and floundering through the water and mud, leaving theirhorses behind, and drove away the cavalry pickets.  A pontoon bridge wasspeedily thrown across, over which the remainder of the army soon passedand pushed out for a mile or two to watch and detain any advance thatmight be made from the other side.  Warren followed the cavalry, and bythe morning of the 13th had his whole corps over.  Hancock followedWarren.  Burnside took the road to Jones's Bridge, followed by Wright.Ferrero's division, with the wagon train, moved farther east, by WindowShades and Cole's Ferry, our rear being covered by cavalry.It was known that the enemy had some gunboats at Richmond. These mightrun down at night and inflict great damage upon us before they could besunk or captured by our navy.  General Butler had, in advance, loadedsome vessels with stone ready to be sunk so as to obstruct the channelin an emergency.  On the 13th I sent orders to have these sunk as highup the river as we could guard them, and prevent their removal by theenemy.As soon as Warren's corps was over the Chickahominy it marched out andjoined the cavalry in holding the roads from Richmond while the armypassed.  No attempt was made by the enemy to impede our march, however,but Warren and Wilson reported the enemy strongly fortified in theirfront.  By the evening of the 13th Hancock's corps was at Charles CityCourt House on the James River.  Burnside's and Wright's corps were onthe Chickahominy, and crossed during the night, Warren's corps and thecavalry still covering the army.  The material for a pontoon bridge wasalready at hand and the work of laying it was commenced immediately,under the superintendence of Brigadier-General Benham, commanding theengineer brigade.  On the evening of the 14th the crossing commenced,Hancock in advance, using both the bridge and boats.When the Wilderness campaign commenced the Army of the Potomac,including Burnside's--which was a separate command until the 24th of Maywhen it was incorporated with the main army--numbered about 116,000 men.During the progress of the campaign about 40,000 reinforcements werereceived.  At the crossing of the James River June 14th-15th the armynumbered about 115,000.  Besides the ordinary losses incident to acampaign of six weeks' nearly constant fighting or skirmishing, aboutone-half of the artillery was sent back to Washington, and many men weredischarged by reason of the expiration of their term of service.* Inestimating our strength every enlisted man and every commissionedofficer present is included, no matter how employed; in bands, sick infield hospitals, hospital attendants, company cooks and all.  Operatingin an enemy's country, and being supplied always from a distant base,large detachments had at all times to be sent from the front, not onlyto guard the base of supplies and the roads to it, but all the roadsleading to our flanks and rear.  We were also operating in a countryunknown to us, and without competent guides or maps showing the roadsaccurately.The manner of estimating numbers in the two armies differs materially.In the Confederate army often only bayonets are taken into account,never, I believe, do they estimate more than are handling the guns ofthe artillery and armed with muskets (*36) or carbines.  Generally thelatter are far enough away to be excluded from the count in any onefield.  Officers and details of enlisted men are not included.  In theNorthern armies the estimate is most liberal, taking in all connectedwith the army and drawing pay.Estimated in the same manner as ours, Lee had not less than 80,000 menat the start.  His reinforcements were about equal to ours during thecampaign, deducting the discharged men and those sent back.  He was onthe defensive, and in a country in which every stream, every road, everyobstacle to the movement of troops and every natural defence wasfamiliar to him and his army.  The citizens were all friendly to him andhis cause, and could and did furnish him with accurate reports of ourevery move.  Rear guards were not necessary for him, and having always arailroad at his back, large wagon trains were not required. Allcircumstances considered we did not have any advantage in numbers.General Lee, who had led the Army of Northern Virginia in all thesecontests, was a very highly estimated man in the Confederate army andStates, and filled also a very high place in the estimation of thepeople and press of the Northern States.  His praise was soundedthroughout the entire North after every action he was engaged in:  thenumber of his forces was always lowered and that of the National forcesexaggerated.  He was a large, austere man, and I judge difficult ofapproach to his subordinates.  To be extolled by the entire press of theSouth after every engagement, and by a portion of the press North withequal vehemence, was calculated to give him the entire confidence of histroops and to make him feared by his antagonists.  It was not anuncommon thing for my staff-officers to hear from Eastern officers,'Well, Grant has never met Bobby Lee yet.'  There were good and trueofficers who believe now that the Army of Northern Virginia was superiorto the Army of the Potomac man to man.  I do not believe so, except asthe advantages spoken of above made them so.  Before the end I believethe difference was the other way.  The Army of Northern Virginia becamedespondent and saw the end.  It did not please them.  The National armysaw the same thing, and were encouraged by it.The advance of the Army of the Potomac reached the James on the 14th ofJune.  Preparations were at once commenced for laying the pontoonbridges and crossing the river.  As already stated, I had previouslyordered General Butler to have two vessels loaded with stone and carriedup the river to a point above that occupied by our gunboats, where thechannel was narrow, and sunk there so as to obstruct the passage andprevent Confederate gunboats from coming down the river.  Butler had hadthese boats filled and put in position, but had not had them sunk beforemy arrival.  I ordered this done, and also directed that he should turnover all material and boats not then in use in the river to be used inferrying the troops across.I then, on the 14th, took a steamer and ran up to Bermuda Hundred to seeGeneral Butler for the purpose of directing a movement againstPetersburg, while our troops of the Army of the Potomac were crossing.I had sent General W. F. Smith back from Cold Harbor by the way of WhiteHouse, thence on steamers to City Point for the purpose of givingGeneral Butler more troops with which to accomplish this result.General Butler was ordered to send Smith with his troops reinforced, asfar as that could be conveniently done, from other parts of the Army ofthe James.  He gave Smith about six thousand reinforcements, includingsome twenty-five hundred cavalry under Kautz, and about thirty-fivehundred colored infantry under Hinks.The distance which Smith had to move to reach the enemy's lines wasabout six miles, and the Confederate advance line of works was but twomiles outside of Petersburg.  Smith was to move under cover of night, upclose to the enemy's works, and assault as soon as he could afterdaylight.  I believed then, and still believe, that Petersburg couldhave been easily captured at that time.  It only had about 2,500 men inthe defences besides some irregular troops, consisting of citizens andemployees in the city who took up arms in case of emergency.  Smithstarted as proposed, but his advance encountered a rebel forceintrenched between City Point and their lines outside of Petersburg.This position he carried, with some loss to the enemy; but there was somuch delay that it was daylight before his troops really got off fromthere.  While there I informed General Butler that Hancock's corps wouldcross the river and move to Petersburg to support Smith in case thelatter was successful, and that I could reinforce there more rapidlythan Lee could reinforce from his position.I returned down the river to where the troops of the Army of the Potomacnow were, communicated to General Meade, in writing, the directions Ihad given to General Butler and directed him (Meade) to cross Hancock'scorps over under cover of night, and push them forward in the morning toPetersburg; halting them, however, at a designated point until theycould hear from Smith.  I also informed General Meade that I had orderedrations from Bermuda Hundred for Hancock's corps, and desired him toissue them speedily, and to lose no more time than was absolutelynecessary.  The rations did not reach him, however, and Hancock, whilehe got all his corps over during the night, remained until half-past tenin the hope of receiving them.  He then moved without them, and on theroad received a note from General W. F. Smith, asking him to come on.This seems to be the first information that General Hancock had receivedof the fact that he was to go to Petersburg, or that anything particularwas expected of him.  Otherwise he would have been there by four o'clockin the afternoon.Smith arrived in front of the enemy's lines early in the forenoon of the15th, and spent the day until after seven o'clock in the evening inreconnoitering what appeared to be empty works.  The enemy's lineconsisted of redans occupying commanding positions, with rifle-pitsconnecting them.  To the east side of Petersburg, from the Appomattoxback, there were thirteen of these redans extending a distance ofseveral miles, probably three.  If they had been properly manned theycould have held out against any force that could have attacked them, atleast until reinforcements could have got up from the north of Richmond.Smith assaulted with the colored troops, and with success.  By nineo'clock at night he was in possession of five of these redans and, ofcourse, of the connecting lines of rifle-pits. All of them containedartillery, which fell into our hands. Hancock came up and proposed totake any part assigned to him; and Smith asked him to relieve his menwho were in the trenches.Next morning, the 16th, Hancock himself was in command, and capturedanother redan.  Meade came up in the afternoon and succeeded Hancock,who had to be relieved, temporarily, from the command of his corps onaccount of the breaking out afresh of the wound he had received atGettysburg.  During the day Meade assaulted and carried one more redanto his right and two to his left.  In all this we lost very heavily.The works were not strongly manned, but they all had guns in them whichfell into our hands, together with the men who were handling them in theeffort to repel these assaults.Up to this time Beauregard, who had commanded south of Richmond, hadreceived no reinforcements, except Hoke's division from Drury'sBluff,(*37) which had arrived on the morning of the 16th; though he hadurged the authorities very strongly to send them, believing, as he did,that Petersburg would be a valuable prize which we might seek.During the 17th the fighting was very severe and the losses heavy; andat night our troops occupied about the same position they had occupiedin the morning, except that they held a redan which had been captured byPotter during the day.  During the night, however, Beauregard fell backto the line which had been already selected, and commenced fortifyingit.  Our troops advanced on the 18th to the line which he had abandoned,and found that the Confederate loss had been very severe, many of theenemy's dead still remaining in the ditches and in front of them.Colonel J. L. Chamberlain, of the 20th Maine, was wounded on the 18th.He was gallantly leading his brigade at the time, as he had been inthe habit of doing in all the engagements in which he had previouslybeen engaged.  He had several times been recommended for abrigadier-generalcy for gallant and meritorious conduct.  On thisoccasion, however, I promoted him on the spot, and forwarded a copy ofmy order to the War Department, asking that my act might be confirmedand Chamberlain's name sent to the Senate for confirmation without anydelay.  This was done, and at last a gallant and meritorious officerreceived partial justice at the hands of his government, which he hadserved so faithfully and so well.If General Hancock's orders of the 15th had been communicated to him,that officer, with his usual promptness, would undoubtedly have beenupon the ground around Petersburg as early as four o'clock in theafternoon of the 15th.  The days were long and it would have given himconsiderable time before night.  I do not think there is any doubt thatPetersburg itself could have been carried without much loss; or, atleast, if protected by inner detached works, that a line could have beenestablished very much in rear of the one then occupied by the enemy.This would have given us control of both the Weldon and South Siderailroads.  This would also have saved an immense amount of hardfighting which had to be done from the 15th to the 18th, and would havegiven us greatly the advantage in the long siege which ensued.I now ordered the troops to be put under cover and allowed some of therest which they had so long needed.  They remained quiet, except thatthere was more or less firing every day, until the 22d, when GeneralMeade ordered an advance towards the Weldon Railroad.  We were veryanxious to get to that road, and even round to the South Side Railroadif possible.Meade moved Hancock's corps, now commanded by Birney, to the left, witha view to at least force the enemy to stay within the limits of his ownline.  General Wright, with the 6th corps, was ordered by a road farthersouth, to march directly for the Weldon road.  The enemy passed inbetween these two corps and attacked vigorously, and with very seriousresults to the National troops, who were then withdrawn from theiradvanced position.The Army of the Potomac was given the investment of Petersburg, whilethe Army of the James held Bermuda Hundred and all the ground wepossessed north of the James River.  The 9th corps, Burnside's, wasplaced upon the right at Petersburg; the 5th, Warren's, next; the 2d,Birney's, next; then the 6th, Wright's, broken off to the left andsouth.  Thus began the siege of Petersburg.
ISFP	 LVII.RAID ON THE VIRGINIA CENTRAL RAILROAD--RAID ON THE WELDON RAILROAD--EARLY 'S MOVEMENT UPON WASHINGTON--MINING THE WORKS BEFORE PETERSBURG--EXPLOSION OF THE MINE BEFORE PETERSBURG--CAMPAIGN IN THE SHENANDOAHVALLEY--CAPTURE OF THE WELDON RAILROAD.On the 7th of June, while at Cold Harbor, I had as already indicatedsent Sheridan with two divisions of cavalry to destroy as much as hecould of the Virginia Central Railroad.  General Hunter had beenoperating up the Shenandoah Valley with some success, having fought abattle near Staunton where he captured a great many prisoners, besideskilling and wounding a good many men.  After the battle he formed ajunction at Staunton with Averell and Crook, who had come up from theKanawha, or Gauley River.  It was supposed, therefore, that GeneralHunter would be about Charlottesville, Virginia, by the time Sheridancould get there, doing on the way the damage that he was sent to do.I gave Sheridan instructions to have Hunter, in case he should meet himabout Charlottesville, join and return with him to the Army of thePotomac.  Lee, hearing of Hunter's success in the valley, startedBreckinridge out for its defence at once. Learning later of Sheridan'sgoing with two divisions, he also sent Hampton with two divisions ofcavalry, his own and Fitz-Hugh Lee's.Sheridan moved to the north side of the North Anna to get out west, andlearned of the movement of these troops to the south side of the samestream almost as soon as they had started. He pushed on to get toTrevilian Station to commence his destruction at that point.  On thenight of the 10th he bivouacked some six or seven miles east ofTrevilian, while Fitz-Hugh Lee was the same night at Trevilian Stationand Hampton but a few miles away.During the night Hampton ordered an advance on Sheridan, hoping, nodoubt, to surprise and very badly cripple him.  Sheridan, however, by acounter move sent Custer on a rapid march to get between the twodivisions of the enemy and into their rear. This he did successfully, sothat at daylight, when the assault was made, the enemy found himself atthe same time resisted in front and attacked in rear, and broke in someconfusion.  The losses were probably very light on both sides in killedand wounded, but Sheridan got away with some five hundred prisoners andsent them to City Point.During that day, the 11th, Sheridan moved into Trevilian Station, andthe following day proceeded to tear up the road east and west.  Therewas considerable fighting during the whole of the day, but the work ofdestruction went on.  In the meantime, at night, the enemy had takenpossession of the crossing which Sheridan had proposed to take to gonorth when he left Trevilian.  Sheridan learned, however, from some ofthe prisoners he had captured here, that General Hunter was aboutLynchburg, and therefore that there was no use of his going on toCharlottesville with a view to meet him.Sheridan started back during the night of the 12th, and made his waynorth and farther east, coming around by the north side of White House,and arriving there on the 21st.  Here he found an abundance of foragefor his animals, food for his men, and security while resting.  He hadbeen obliged to leave about ninety of his own men in the field-hospitalwhich he had established near Trevilian, and these necessarily fell intothe hands of the enemy.White House up to this time had been a depot; but now that our troopswere all on the James River, it was no longer wanted as a store ofsupplies.  Sheridan was, therefore, directed to break it up; which hedid on the 22d of June, bringing the garrison and an immense wagon trainwith him.  All these were over the James River by the 26th of the month,and Sheridan ready to follow.In the meantime Meade had sent Wilson's division on a raid to destroythe Weldon and South Side roads.  Now that Sheridan was safe and Hamptonfree to return to Richmond with his cavalry, Wilson's position becameprecarious.  Meade therefore, on the 27th, ordered Sheridan over theriver to make a demonstration in favor of Wilson.  Wilson got back,though not without severe loss, having struck both roads, but the damagedone was soon repaired.After these events comparative quiet reigned about Petersburg until latein July.  The time, however, was spent in strengthening theintrenchments and making our position generally more secure against asudden attack.  In the meantime I had to look after other portions of mycommand, where things had not been going on so favorably, always, as Icould have wished.General Hunter who had been appointed to succeed Sigel in the ShenandoahValley immediately took up the offensive.  He met the enemy on the 5thof June at Piedmont, and defeated him.  On the 8th he formed a junctionwith Crook and Averell at Staunton, from which place he moved direct onLynchburg, via Lexington, which he reached and invested on the 16th.  Upto this time he was very successful; and but for the difficulty oftaking with him sufficient ordnance stores over so long a march, througha hostile country, he would, no doubt, have captured Lynchburg. Thedestruction of the enemy's supplies and manufactories had been verygreat.  To meet this movement under General Hunter, General Lee sentEarly with his corps, a part of which reached Lynchburg before Hunter.After some skirmishing on the 17th and 18th, General Hunter, owing to awant of ammunition to give battle, retired from before the place.Unfortunately, this want of ammunition left him no choice of route forhis return but by the way of the Gauley and Kanawha rivers, thence upthe Ohio River, returning to Harper's Ferry by way of the Baltimore andOhio Railroad.  A long time was consumed in making this movement.Meantime the valley was left open to Early's troops, and others in thatquarter; and Washington also was uncovered. Early took advantage of thiscondition of affairs and moved on Washington.In the absence of Hunter, General Lew Wallace, with headquarters atBaltimore, commanded the department in which the Shenandoah lay.  Hissurplus of troops with which to move against the enemy was small innumber.  Most of these were raw and, consequently, very much inferior toour veterans and to the veterans which Early had with him; but thesituation of Washington was precarious, and Wallace moved withcommendable promptitude to meet the enemy at the Monocacy.  He couldhardly have expected to defeat him badly, but he hoped to cripple anddelay him until Washington could be put into a state of preparation forhis reception.  I had previously ordered General Meade to send adivision to Baltimore for the purpose of adding to the defences ofWashington, and he had sent Ricketts's division of the 6th corps(Wright's), which arrived in Baltimore on the 8th of July.  Finding thatWallace had gone to the front with his command, Ricketts immediatelytook the cars and followed him to the Monocacy with his entire division.They met the enemy and, as might have been expected, were defeated; butthey succeeded in stopping him for the day on which the battle tookplace.  The next morning Early started on his march to the capital ofthe Nation, arriving before it on the 11th.Learning of the gravity of the situation I had directed General Meade toalso order Wright with the rest of his corps directly to Washington forthe relief of that place, and the latter reached there the very day thatEarly arrived before it.  The 19th corps, which had been stationed inLouisiana, having been ordered up to reinforce the armies aboutRichmond, had about this time arrived at Fortress Monroe, on their wayto join us. I diverted them from that point to Washington, which placethey reached, almost simultaneously with Wright, on the 11th.  The 19thcorps was commanded by Major-General Emory.Early made his reconnoissance with a view of attacking on the followingmorning, the 12th; but the next morning he found our intrenchments,which were very strong, fully manned.  He at once commenced to retreat,Wright following.  There is no telling how much this result wascontributed to by General Lew Wallace's leading what might well beconsidered almost a forlorn hope.  If Early had been but one day earlierhe might have entered the capital before the arrival of thereinforcements I had sent. Whether the delay caused by the battleamounted to a day or not, General Wallace contributed on this occasion,by the defeat of the troops under him a greater benefit to the causethan often falls to the lot of a commander of an equal force to renderby means of a victory.Farther west also the troubles were threatening.  Some time before,Forrest had met Sturgis in command of some of our cavalry in Mississippiand handled him very roughly, gaining a very great victory over him.This left Forrest free to go almost where he pleased, and to cut theroads in rear of Sherman who was then advancing.  Sherman was abundantlyable to look after the army that he was immediately with, and all of hismilitary division so long as he could communicate with it; but it was myplace to see that he had the means with which to hold his rear.  Twodivisions under A. J. Smith had been sent to Banks in Louisiana somemonths before.  Sherman ordered these back, with directions to attackForrest.  Smith met and defeated him very badly.  I then directed thatSmith should hang to Forrest and not let him go; and to prevent by allmeans his getting upon the Memphis and Nashville Railroad.  Sherman hadanticipated me in this matter, and given the same orders in substance;but receiving my directions for this order to Smith, he repeated it.On the 25th of June General Burnside had commenced running a mine fromabout the centre of his front under the Confederate works confrontinghim.  He was induced to do this by Colonel Pleasants, of thePennsylvania Volunteers, whose regiment was mostly composed of miners,and who was himself a practical miner.  Burnside had submitted thescheme to Meade and myself, and we both approved of it, as a means ofkeeping the men occupied.  His position was very favorable for carryingon this work, but not so favorable for the operations to follow itscompletion.  The position of the two lines at that point were only abouta hundred yards apart with a comparatively deep ravine intervening.  Inthe bottom of this ravine the work commenced.  The position wasunfavorable in this particular: that the enemy's line at that point wasre-entering, so that its front was commanded by their own lines both tothe right and left.  Then, too, the ground was sloping upward back ofthe Confederate line for a considerable distance, and it was presumablethat the enemy had, at least, a detached work on this highest point.The work progressed, and on the 23d of July the mine was finished readyfor charging; but I had this work of charging deferred until we wereready for it.On the 17th of July several deserters came in and said that there wasgreat consternation in Richmond, and that Lee was coming out to make anattack upon us the object being to put us on the defensive so that hemight detach troops to go to Georgia where the army Sherman wasoperating against was said to be in great trouble.  I put the armycommanders, Meade and Butler, on the lookout, but the attack was notmade.I concluded, then, a few days later, to do something in the way ofoffensive movement myself, having in view something of the same objectthat Lee had had.  Wright's and Emory's corps were in Washington, andwith this reduction of my force Lee might very readily have spared sometroops from the defences to send West.  I had other objects in view,however, besides keeping Lee where he was.  The mine was constructed andready to be exploded, and I wanted to take that occasion to carryPetersburg if I could.  It was the object, therefore, to get as many ofLee's troops away from the south side of the James River as possible.Accordingly, on the 26th, we commenced a movement with Hancock's corpsand Sheridan's cavalry to the north side by the way of Deep Bottom,where Butler had a pontoon bridge laid. The plan, in the main, was tolet the cavalry cut loose and, joining with Kautz's cavalry of the Armyof the James, get by Lee's lines and destroy as much as they could ofthe Virginia Central Railroad, while, in the mean time, the infantry wasto move out so as to protect their rear and cover their retreat backwhen they should have got through with their work.  We were successfulin drawing the enemy's troops to the north side of the James as Iexpected.  The mine was ordered to be charged, and the morning of the30th of July was the time fixed for its explosion.  I gave Meade minuteorders (*38) on the 24th directing how I wanted the assault conducted,which orders he amplified into general instructions for the guidance ofthe troops that were to be engaged.Meade's instructions, which I, of course, approved most heartily, wereall that I can see now was necessary.  The only further precaution whichhe could have taken, and which he could not foresee, would have been tohave different men to execute them.The gallery to the mine was over five hundred feet long from where itentered the ground to the point where it was under the enemy's works,and with a cross gallery of something over eighty feet running undertheir lines.  Eight chambers had been left, requiring a ton of powdereach to charge them.  All was ready by the time I had prescribed; and onthe 29th Hancock and Sheridan were brought back near the James Riverwith their troops.  Under cover of night they started to recross thebridge at Deep Bottom, and to march directly for that part of our linesin front of the mine.Warren was to hold his line of intrenchments with a sufficient number ofmen and concentrate the balance on the right next to Burnside's corps,while Ord, now commanding the 18th corps, temporarily under Meade, wasto form in the rear of Burnside to support him when he went in.  Allwere to clear off the parapets and the _abatis_ in their front so as toleave the space as open as possible, and be able to charge the momentthe mine had been sprung and Burnside had taken possession.  Burnside'scorps was not to stop in the crater at all but push on to the top of thehill, supported on the right and left by Ord's and Warren's corps.Warren and Ord fulfilled their instructions perfectly so far as makingready was concerned.  Burnside seemed to have paid no attention whateverto the instructions, and left all the obstruction in his own front forhis troops to get over in the best way they could.  The four divisionsof his corps were commanded by Generals Potter, Willcox, Ledlie andFerrero.  The last was a colored division; and Burnside selected it tomake the assault.  Meade interfered with this.  Burnside then tookLedlie's division--a worse selection than the first could have been.  Infact, Potter and Willcox were the only division commanders Burnside hadwho were equal to the occasion.  Ledlie besides being otherwiseinefficient, proved also to possess disqualification less common amongsoldiers.There was some delay about the explosion of the mine so that it did notgo off until about five o'clock in the morning.  When it did explode itwas very successful, making a crater twenty feet deep and something likea hundred feet in length.  Instantly one hundred and ten cannon andfifty mortars, which had been placed in the most commanding positionscovering the ground to the right and left of where the troops were toenter the enemy's lines, commenced playing.  Ledlie's division marchedinto the crater immediately on the explosion, but most of the menstopped there in the absence of any one to give directions; theircommander having found some safe retreat to get into before theystarted.  There was some delay on the left and right in advancing, butsome of the troops did get in and turn to the right and left, carryingthe rifle-pits as I expected they would do.There had been great consternation in Petersburg, as we were well aware,about a rumored mine that we were going to explode.  They knew we weremining, and they had failed to cut our mine off by countermining, thoughBeauregard had taken the precaution to run up a line of intrenchments tothe rear of that part of their line fronting where they could see thatour men were at work.  We had learned through deserters who had come inthat the people had very wild rumors about what was going on on ourside.  They said that we had undermined the whole of Petersburg; thatthey were resting upon a slumbering volcano and did not know at whatmoment they might expect an eruption.  I somewhat based my calculationsupon this state of feeling, and expected that when the mine was explodedthe troops to the right and left would flee in all directions, and thatour troops, if they moved promptly, could get in and strengthenthemselves before the enemy had come to a realization of the truesituation.  It was just as I expected it would be.  We could see the menrunning without any apparent object except to get away. It was half anhour before musketry firing, to amount to anything, was opened upon ourmen in the crater.  It was an hour before the enemy got artillery up toplay upon them; and it was nine o'clock before Lee got up reinforcementsfrom his right to join in expelling our troops.The effort was a stupendous failure.  It cost us about four thousandmen, mostly, however, captured; and all due to inefficiency on the partof the corps commander and the incompetency of the division commanderwho was sent to lead the assault.After being fully assured of the failure of the mine, and finding thatmost of that part of Lee's army which had been drawn north of the JamesRiver were still there, I gave Meade directions to send a corps ofinfantry and the cavalry next morning, before Lee could get his forcesback, to destroy fifteen or twenty miles of the Weldon Railroad.  Butmisfortunes never come singly.  I learned during that same afternoonthat Wright's pursuit of Early was feeble because of the constant andcontrary orders he had been receiving from Washington, while I was cutoff from immediate communication by reason of our cable acrossChesapeake Bay being broken.  Early, however, was not aware of the factthat Wright was not pursuing until he had reached Strasburg.  Findingthat he was not pursued he turned back to Winchester, where Crook wasstationed with a small force, and drove him out.  He then pushed northuntil he had reached the Potomac, then he sent McCausland across toChambersburg, Pa., to destroy that town.  Chambersburg was a purelydefenceless town with no garrison whatever, and no fortifications; yetMcCausland, under Early's orders, burned the place and left about threehundred families houseless.  This occurred on the 30th of July.  Irescinded my orders for the troops to go out to destroy the WeldonRailroad, and directed them to embark for Washington City.  Afterburning Chambersburg McCausland retreated, pursued by our cavalry,towards Cumberland.  They were met and defeated by General Kelley anddriven into Virginia.The Shenandoah Valley was very important to the Confederates, because itwas the principal storehouse they now had for feeding their armies aboutRichmond.  It was well known that they would make a desperate struggleto maintain it.  It had been the source of a great deal of trouble to usheretofore to guard that outlet to the north, partly because of theincompetency of some of the commanders, but chiefly because ofinterference from Washington.It seemed to be the policy of General Halleck and Secretary Stanton tokeep any force sent there, in pursuit of the invading army, moving rightand left so as to keep between the enemy and our capital; and, generallyspeaking, they pursued this policy until all knowledge of thewhereabouts of the enemy was lost. They were left, therefore, free tosupply themselves with horses, beef cattle, and such provisions as theycould carry away from Western Maryland and Pennsylvania.  I determinedto put a stop to this.  I started Sheridan at once for that field ofoperation, and on the following day sent another division of hiscavalry.I had previously asked to have Sheridan assigned to that command, butMr. Stanton objected, on the ground that he was too young for soimportant a command.  On the 1st of August when I sent reinforcementsfor the protection of Washington, I sent the following orders:CITY POINT, VA.,August 1, 1864, 11.30 A.M.MAJOR-GENERAL HALLECK, Washington D. C.I am sending General Sheridan for temporary duty whilst the enemy isbeing expelled from the border.  Unless General Hunter is in the fieldin person, I want Sheridan put in command of all the troops in thefield, with instructions to put himself south of the enemy and followhim to the death.  Wherever the enemy goes let our troops go also.  Oncestarted up the valley they ought to be followed until we get possessionof the Virginia Central Railroad.  If General Hunter is in the field,give Sheridan direct command of the 6th corps and cavalry division. Allthe cavalry, I presume, will reach Washington in the course ofto-morrow.U. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General.The President in some way or other got to see this dispatch of minedirecting certain instructions to be given to the commanders in thefield, operating against Early, and sent me the following verycharacteristic dispatch:OFFICE U. S. MILITARY TELEGRAPH, WAR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON, D. C.,August 3, 1864.Cypher. 6 P.M.,LT. GENERAL GRANT, City Point, Va.I have seen your despatch in which you say, 'I want Sheridan put incommand of all the troops in the field, with instructions to put himselfsouth of the enemy, and follow him to the death. Wherever the enemygoes, let our troops go also.'  This, I think, is exactly right, as tohow our forces should move.  But please look over the despatches you mayhave received from here, even since you made that order, and discover,if you can, that there is any idea in the head of any one here, of'putting our army south of the enemy,' or of 'following him to thedeath' in any direction.  I repeat to you it will neither be done norattempted unless you watch it every day, and hour, and force it.A. LINCOLN.I replied to this that 'I would start in two hours for Washington,' andsoon got off, going directly to the Monocacy without stopping atWashington on my way.  I found General Hunter's army encamped there,scattered over the fields along the banks of the Monocacy, with manyhundreds of cars and locomotives, belonging to the Baltimore and OhioRailroad, which he had taken the precaution to bring back and collect atthat point.  I asked the general where the enemy was.  He replied thathe did not know.  He said the fact was, that he was so embarrassed withorders from Washington moving him first to the right and then to theleft that he had lost all trace of the enemy.I then told the general that I would find out where the enemy was, andat once ordered steam got up and trains made up, giving directions topush for Halltown, some four miles above Harper's Ferry, in theShenandoah Valley.  The cavalry and the wagon trains were to march, butall the troops that could be transported by the cars were to go in thatway.  I knew that the valley was of such importance to the enemy that,no matter how much he was scattered at that time, he would in a veryshort time be found in front of our troops moving south.I then wrote out General Hunter's instructions. (*39)  I told him thatSheridan was in Washington, and still another division was on its way;and suggested that he establish the headquarters of the department atany point that would suit him best, Cumberland, Baltimore, or elsewhere,and give Sheridan command of the troops in the field.  The generalreplied to this, that he thought he had better be relieved entirely.  Hesaid that General Halleck seemed so much to distrust his fitness for theposition he was in that he thought somebody else ought to be there.  Hedid not want, in any way, to embarrass the cause; thus showing apatriotism that was none too common in the army.  There were not manymajor-generals who would voluntarily have asked to have the command of adepartment taken from them on the supposition that for some particularreason, or for any reason, the service would be better performed.  Itold him, 'very well then,' and telegraphed at once for Sheridan to cometo the Monocacy, and suggested that I would wait and meet him there.Sheridan came at once by special train, but reached there after thetroops were all off.  I went to the station and remained there until hearrived.  Myself and one or two of my staff were about all the Unionpeople, except General Hunter and his staff, who were left at theMonocacy when Sheridan arrived.  I hastily told Sheridan what had beendone and what I wanted him to do, giving him, at the same time, thewritten instructions which had been prepared for General Hunter anddirected to that officer.Sheridan now had about 30,000 men to move with, 8,000 of them beingcavalry.  Early had about the same number, but the superior ability ofthe National commander over the Confederate commander was so great thatall the latter's advantage of being on the defensive was more thancounterbalanced by this circumstance.  As I had predicted, Early wassoon found in front of Sheridan in the valley, and Pennsylvania andMaryland were speedily freed from the invaders.  The importance of thevalley was so great to the Confederates that Lee reinforced Early, butnot to the extent that we thought and feared he would.To prevent as much as possible these reinforcements from being sent outfrom Richmond, I had to do something to compel Lee to retain his forcesabout his capital.  I therefore gave orders for another move to thenorth side of the James River, to threaten Richmond.  Hancock's corps,part of the 10th corps under Birney, and Gregg's division of cavalrywere crossed to the north side of the James during the night of the13th-14th of August.  A threatening position was maintained for a numberof days, with more or less skirmishing, and some tolerably hardfighting; although it was my object and my instructions that anythinglike a battle should be avoided, unless opportunities should presentthemselves which would insure great success. General Meade was left incommand of the few troops around Petersburg, strongly intrenched; andwas instructed to keep a close watch upon the enemy in that quarter, andhimself to take advantage of any weakening that might occur through aneffort on the part of the enemy to reinforce the north side.  There wasno particular victory gained on either side; but during that time nomore reinforcements were sent to the valley.I informed Sheridan of what had been done to prevent reinforcementsbeing sent from Richmond against him, and also that the efforts we hadmade had proven that one of the divisions which we supposed had gone tothe valley was still at Richmond, because we had captured six or sevenhundred prisoners from that division, each of its four brigades havingcontributed to our list of captures.  I also informed him that but onedivision had gone, and it was possible that I should be able to preventthe going of any more.To add to my embarrassment at this time Sherman, who was now nearAtlanta, wanted reinforcements.  He was perfectly willing to take theraw troops then being raised in the North-west, saying that he couldteach them more soldiering in one day among his troops than they wouldlearn in a week in a camp of instruction.  I therefore asked that alltroops in camps of instruction in the North-west be sent to him.Sherman also wanted to be assured that no Eastern troops were moving outagainst him.  I informed him of what I had done and assured him that Iwould hold all the troops there that it was possible for me to hold, andthat up to that time none had gone.  I also informed him that his realdanger was from Kirby Smith, who commanded the trans-MississippiDepartment.  If Smith should escape Steele, and get across theMississippi River, he might move against him.  I had, therefore, askedto have an expedition ready to move from New Orleans against Mobile incase Kirby Smith should get across.  This would have a tendency to drawhim to the defence of that place, instead of going against Sherman.Right in the midst of all these embarrassments Halleck informed me thatthere was an organized scheme on foot in the North to resist the draft,and suggested that it might become necessary to draw troops from thefield to put it down.  He also advised taking in sail, and not going toofast.The troops were withdrawn from the north side of the James River on thenight of the 20th.  Before they were withdrawn, however, and while mostof Lee's force was on that side of the river, Warren had been sent withmost of the 5th corps to capture the Weldon Railroad.  He took up hisline of march well back to the rear, south of the enemy, while thetroops remaining in the trenches extended so as to cover that part ofthe line which he had vacated by moving out.  From our left, near theold line, it was about three miles to the Weldon Railroad.  A divisionwas ordered from the right of the Petersburg line to reinforce Warren,while a division was brought back from the north side of the James Riverto take its place.This road was very important to the enemy.  The limits from which hissupplies had been drawn were already very much contracted, and I knewthat he must fight desperately to protect it.  Warren carried the road,though with heavy loss on both sides.  He fortified his new position,and our trenches were then extended from the left of our main line toconnect with his new one.  Lee made repeated attempts to dislodgeWarren's corps, but without success, and with heavy loss.As soon as Warren was fortified and reinforcements reached him, troopswere sent south to destroy the bridges on the Weldon Railroad; and withsuch success that the enemy had to draw in wagons, for a distance ofabout thirty miles, all the supplies they got thereafter from thatsource.  It was on the 21st that Lee seemed to have given up the WeldonRailroad as having been lost to him; but along about the 24th or 25th hemade renewed attempts to recapture it; again he failed and with veryheavy losses to him as compared with ours.On the night of the 20th our troops on the north side of the James werewithdrawn, and Hancock and Gregg were sent south to destroy the WeldonRailroad.  They were attacked on the 25th at Reams's Station, and afterdesperate fighting a part of our line gave way, losing five pieces ofartillery.  But the Weldon Railroad never went out of our possessionfrom the 18th of August to the close of the war.
ISFP	 LVIII.SHERIDAN'S ADVANCE--VISIT TO SHERIDAN--SHERIDAN'S VICTORY IN THESHENANDOAH--SHERIDAN'S RIDE TO WINCHESTER--CLOSE OF THE CAMPAIGN FOR THEWINTER.We had our troops on the Weldon Railroad contending against a largeforce that regarded this road of so much importance that they couldafford to expend many lives in retaking it; Sherman just getting throughto Atlanta with great losses of men from casualties, discharges anddetachments left along as guards to occupy and hold the road in rear ofhim; Washington threatened but a short time before, and now Early beingstrengthened in the valley so as, probably, to renew that attempt.  Itkept me pretty active in looking after all these points.On the 10th of August Sheridan had advanced on Early up the ShenandoahValley, Early falling back to Strasburg.  On the 12th I learned that Leehad sent twenty pieces of artillery, two divisions of infantry and aconsiderable cavalry force to strengthen Early.  It was important thatSheridan should be informed of this, so I sent the information toWashington by telegraph, and directed a courier to be sent from there toget the message to Sheridan at all hazards, giving him the information.The messenger, an officer of the army, pushed through with great energyand reached Sheridan just in time. The officer went through by way ofSnicker's Gap, escorted by some cavalry.  He found Sheridan just makinghis preparations to attack Early in his chosen position.  Now, however,he was thrown back on the defensive.On the 15th of September I started to visit General Sheridan in theShenandoah Valley.  My purpose was to have him attack Early, or drivehim out of the valley and destroy that source of supplies for Lee'sarmy.  I knew it was impossible for me to get orders through Washingtonto Sheridan to make a move, because they would be stopped there and suchorders as Halleck's caution (and that of the Secretary of War) wouldsuggest would be given instead, and would, no doubt, be contradictory tomine.  I therefore, without stopping at Washington, went directlythrough to Charlestown, some ten miles above Harper's Ferry, and waitedthere to see General Sheridan, having sent a courier in advance toinform him where to meet me.When Sheridan arrived I asked him if he had a map showing the positionsof his army and that of the enemy.  He at once drew one out of his sidepocket, showing all roads and streams, and the camps of the two armies.He said that if he had permission he would move so and so (pointing outhow) against the Confederates, and that he could 'whip them.'  Beforestarting I had drawn up a plan of campaign for Sheridan, which I hadbrought with me; but, seeing that he was so clear and so positive in hisviews and so confident of success, I said nothing about this and did nottake it out of my pocket.Sheridan's wagon trains were kept at Harper's Ferry, where all of hisstores were.  By keeping the teams at that place, their forage did nothave to be hauled to them.  As supplies of ammunition, provisions andrations for the men were wanted, trains would be made up to deliver thestores to the commissaries and quartermasters encamped at Winchester.Knowing that he, in making preparations to move at a given day, wouldhave to bring up wagons trains from Harper's Ferry, I asked him if hecould be ready to get off by the following Tuesday.  This was on Friday.'O Yes,' he said, he 'could be off before daylight on Monday.'  I toldhim then to make the attack at that time and according to his own plan;and I immediately started to return to the army about Richmond.  Aftervisiting Baltimore and Burlington, New Jersey, I arrived at City Pointon the 19th.On the way out to Harper's Ferry I had met Mr. Robert Garrett, Presidentof the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad.  He seemed very anxious to know whenworkmen might be put upon the road again so as to make repairs and putit in shape for running.  It was a large piece of property to havestanding idle.  I told him I could not answer then positively but wouldtry and inform him before a great while.  On my return Mr. Garrett metme again with the same and I told him I thought that by the Wednesday hemight send his workmen out on his road.  I gave him no furtherinformation however, and he had no suspicion of how I expected to havethe road cleared for his workmen.Sheridan moved at the time he had fixed upon.  He met Early at thecrossing of Opequon Creek, a most decisive victory--one which thecountry.  Early had invited this attack himself by his bad generalshipand made the victory easy.  He had sent G. T. Anderson's division eastof the Blue Ridge before I went to Harper's Ferry; and about the time Iarrived there he started other divisions (leaving but two in theircamps) to march to Martinsburg for the purpose destroying the Baltimoreand Ohio Railroad at that point.  Early here learned that I had beenwith Sheridan and, supposing there was some movement on foot, startedback as soon as he got the information.  But his forces were separatedand, as I have said, he was very badly defeated.  He fell back toFisher's Hill, Sheridan following.The valley is narrow at that point, and Early made another stand there,behind works which extended across.  But Sheridan turned both his flanksand again sent him speeding up the valley, following in hot pursuit.The pursuit was continued up the valley to Mount Jackson and New Market.Sheridan captured about eleven hundred prisoners and sixteen guns.  Thehouses which he passed all along the route were found to be filled withEarly's wounded, and the country swarmed with his deserters.  Finally,on the 25th, Early turned from the valley eastward, leaving Sheridan atHarrisonburg in undisputed possession.Now one of the main objects of the expedition began to be accomplished.Sheridan went to work with his command, gathering in the crops, cattle,and everything in the upper part of the valley required by our troops;and especially taking what might be of use to the enemy.  What he couldnot take away he destroyed, so that the enemy would not be invited tocome back there.  I congratulated Sheridan upon his recent great victoryand had a salute of a hundred guns fired in honor of it, the guns beingaimed at the enemy around Petersburg.  I also notified the othercommanders throughout the country, who also fired salutes in honor ofhis victory.I had reason to believe that the administration was a little afraid tohave a decisive battle at that time, for fear it might go against us andhave a bad effect on the November elections. The convention which hadmet and made its nomination of the Democratic candidate for thepresidency had declared the war a failure.  Treason was talked as boldlyin Chicago at that convention as ever been in Charleston.  It was aquestion whether the government would then have had the power to makearrests and punish those who talked treason.  But this decisive victorywas the most effective campaign argument made in the canvass.Sheridan, in his pursuit, got beyond where they could hear from him inWashington, and the President became very much frightened about him.  Hewas afraid that the hot pursuit had been a little like that of GeneralCass was said to have been, in one of our Indian wars, when he was anofficer of army.  Cass was pursuing the Indians so closely that thefirst thing he knew he found himself in front, and the Indians pursuinghim.  The President was afraid that Sheridan had got on the other sideof Early and that Early was in behind him.  He was afraid that Sheridanwas getting so far away that reinforcements would be sent out fromRichmond to enable Early to beat him.  I replied to the President that Ihad taken steps to prevent Lee from sending reinforcements to Early, byattacking the former where he was.On the 28th of September, to retain Lee in his position, I sent Ord withthe 18th corps and Birney with the 10th corps to make an advance onRichmond, to threaten it.  Ord moved with the left wing up to Chaffin'sBluff; Birney with the 10th corps took a road farther north; while Kautzwith the cavalry took the Darby road, still farther to the north.  Theygot across the river by the next morning, and made an effort to surprisethe enemy.  In that, however, they were unsuccessful.The enemy's lines were very strong and very intricate. Stannard'sdivision of the 18th corps with General Burnham's brigade leading, triedan assault against Fort Harrison and captured it with sixteen guns and agood many prisoners. Burnham was killed in the assault.  Colonel Stevenswho succeeded him was badly wounded; and his successor also fell in thesame way.  Some works to the right and left were also carried with theguns in them--six in number--and a few more prisoners.  Birney's troopsto the right captured the enemy's intrenched picket-lines, but wereunsuccessful in their efforts upon the main line.Our troops fortified their new position, bringing Fort Harrison into thenew line and extending it to the river.  This brought us pretty close tothe enemy on the north side of the James, and the two opposing linesmaintained their relative positions to the close of the siege.In the afternoon a further attempt was made to advance, but it failed.Ord fell badly wounded, and had to be relieved; the command devolvedupon General Heckman, and later General Weitzel was assigned to thecommand of the 18th corps.  During the night Lee reinforced his troopsabout Fort Gilmer, which was at the right of Fort Harrison, by eightadditional brigades from Petersburg, and attempted to retake the workswhich we had captured by concentrating ten brigades against them.  Alltheir efforts failed, their attacks being all repulsed with very heavyloss.  In one of these assaults upon us General Stannard, a gallantofficer who was defending Fort Harrison, lost an arm. Our casualtiesduring these operations amounted to 394 killed, I,554 wounded and 324missing.Whilst this was going on General Meade was instructed to keep up anappearance of moving troops to our extreme left.  Parke and Warren werekept with two divisions, each under arms, ready to move leaving theirenclosed batteries manned, with a scattering line on the otherintrenchments.  The object of this was to prevent reinforcements fromgoing to the north side of the river.  Meade was instructed to watch theenemy closely and, if Lee weakened his lines, to make an attack.On the 30th these troops moved out, under Warren, and captured anadvanced intrenched camp at Peeble's farm, driving the enemy back to themain line.  Our troops followed and made an attack in the hope ofcarrying the enemy's main line; but in this they were unsuccessful andlost a large number of men, mostly captured.  The number of killed andwounded was not large.  The next day our troops advanced again andestablished themselves, intrenching a new line about a mile in front ofthe enemy.  This advanced Warren's position on the Weldon Railroad veryconsiderably.Sheridan having driven the enemy out of the valley, and taken theproductions of the valley so that instead of going there for suppliesthe enemy would have to bring his provisions with him if he againentered it, recommended a reduction of his own force, the surplus to besent where it could be of more use.  I approved of his suggestion, andordered him to send Wright's corps back to the James River.  I furtherdirected him to repair the railroad up the Shenandoah Valley towards theadvanced position which we would hold with a small force.  The troopswere to be sent to Washington by the way of Culpeper, in order to watchthe east side of the Blue Ridge, and prevent the enemy from getting intothe rear of Sheridan while he was still doing his work of destruction.The valley was so very important, however, to the Confederate army that,contrary to our expectations, they determined to make one more strike,and save it if possible before the supplies should be all destroyed.Reinforcements were sent therefore to Early, and this before any of ourtroops had been withdrawn. Early prepared to strike Sheridan atHarrisonburg; but the latter had not remained there.On the 6th of October Sheridan commenced retiring down the valley,taking or destroying all the food and forage and driving the cattlebefore him, Early following.  At Fisher's Hill Sheridan turned hiscavalry back on that of Early, which, under the lead of Rosser, waspursuing closely, and routed it most completely, capturing eleven gunsand a large number of prisoners.  Sheridan lost only about sixty men.His cavalry pursued the enemy back some twenty-five miles.  On the 10thof October the march down the valley was again resumed, Early againfollowing.I now ordered Sheridan to halt, and to improve the opportunity ifafforded by the enemy's having been sufficiently weakened, to move backagain and cut the James River Canal and Virginia Central Railroad.  Butthis order had to go through Washington where it was intercepted; andwhen Sheridan received what purported to be a statement of what I wantedhim to do it was something entirely different.  Halleck informedSheridan that it was my wish for him to hold a forward position as abase from which to act against Charlottesville and Gordonsville; that heshould fortify this position and provision it.Sheridan objected to this most decidedly; and I was impelled totelegraph him, on the 14th, as follows:CITY POINT, VA., October 14, 1864.--12.30 P.M.MAJOR-GENERAL SHERIDAN, Cedar Creek, Va.What I want is for you to threaten the Virginia Central Railroad andcanal in the manner your judgment tells you is best, holding yourselfready to advance, if the enemy draw off their forces. If you make theenemy hold a force equal to your own for the protection of thosethoroughfares, it will accomplish nearly as much as their destruction.If you cannot do this, then the next best thing to do is to send hereall the force you can.  I deem a good cavalry force necessary for youroffensive, as well as defensive operations.  You need not therefore sendhere more than one division of cavalry.U. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General.Sheridan having been summoned to Washington City, started on the 15thleaving Wright in command.  His army was then at Cedar Creek, sometwenty miles south of Winchester.  The next morning while at FrontRoyal, Sheridan received a dispatch from Wright, saying that a dispatchfrom Longstreet to Early had been intercepted.  It directed the latterto be ready to move and to crush Sheridan as soon as he, Longstreet,arrived.  On the receipt of this news Sheridan ordered the cavalry upthe valley to join Wright.On the 18th of October Early was ready to move, and during the nightsucceeded in getting his troops in the rear of our left flank, whichfled precipitately and in great confusion down the valley, losingeighteen pieces of artillery and a thousand or more prisoners.  Theright under General Getty maintained a firm and steady front, fallingback to Middletown where it took a position and made a stand.  Thecavalry went to the rear, seized the roads leading to Winchester andheld them for the use of our troops in falling back, General Wrighthaving ordered a retreat back to that place.Sheridan having left Washington on the 18th, reached Winchester thatnight.  The following morning he started to join his command.  He hadscarcely got out of town, when he met his men returning in panic fromthe front and also heard heavy firing to the south.  He immediatelyordered the cavalry at Winchester to be deployed across the valley tostop the stragglers.  Leaving members of his staff to take care ofWinchester and the public property there, he set out with a small escortdirectly for the scene of battle.  As he met the fugitives he orderedthem to turn back, reminding them that they were going the wrong way.His presence soon restored confidence.  Finding themselves worsefrightened than hurt the men did halt and turn back.  Many of those whohad run ten miles got back in time to redeem their reputation as gallantsoldiers before night.When Sheridan got to the front he found Getty and Custer still holdingtheir ground firmly between the Confederates and our retreating troops.Everything in the rear was now ordered up. Sheridan at once proceeded tointrench his position; and he awaited an assault from the enemy.  Thiswas made with vigor, and was directed principally against Emory's corps,which had sustained the principal loss in the first attack.  By oneo'clock the attack was repulsed.  Early was so badly damaged that heseemed disinclined to make another attack, but went to work to intrenchhimself with a view to holding the position he had already gained.  Hethought, no doubt, that Sheridan would be glad enough to leave himunmolested; but in this he was mistaken.About the middle of the afternoon Sheridan advanced.  He sent hiscavalry by both flanks, and they penetrated to the enemy's rear.  Thecontest was close for a time, but at length the left of the enemy broke,and disintegration along the whole line soon followed.  Early tried torally his men, but they were followed so closely that they had to giveway very quickly every time they attempted to make a stand.  Ourcavalry, having pushed on and got in the rear of the Confederates,captured twenty-four pieces of artillery, besides retaking what had beenlost in the morning.  This victory pretty much closed the campaigning inthe Valley of Virginia.  All the Confederate troops were sent back toRichmond with the exception of one division of infantry and a littlecavalry.  Wright's corps was ordered back to the Army of the Potomac,and two other divisions were withdrawn from the valley.  Early had lostmore men in killed, wounded and captured in the valley than Sheridan hadcommanded from first to last.On more than one occasion in these engagements General R. B. Hayes, whosucceeded me as President of the United States, bore a very honorablepart.  His conduct on the field was marked by conspicuous gallantry aswell as the display of qualities of a higher order than that of merepersonal daring.  This might well have been expected of one who couldwrite at the time he is said to have done so:  'Any officer fit for dutywho at this crisis would abandon his post to electioneer for a seat inCongress, ought to be scalped.'  Having entered the army as a Major ofVolunteers at the beginning of the war, General Hayes attained bymeritorious service the rank of Brevet Major-General before its close.On the north side of the James River the enemy attacked Kautz's cavalryon the 7th of October, and drove it back with heavy loss in killed,wounded and prisoners, and the loss of all the artillery.  This wasfollowed up by an attack on our intrenched infantry line, but wasrepulsed with severe slaughter.  On the 13th a reconnoissance was sentout by General Butler, with a view to drive the enemy from some newworks he was constructing, which resulted in heavy loss to us.On the 24th I ordered General Meade to attempt to get possession of theSouth Side Railroad, and for that purpose to advance on the 27th.  Theattempt proved a failure, however, the most advanced of our troops notgetting nearer than within six miles of the point aimed for.  Seeing theimpossibility of its accomplishment I ordered the troops to withdraw,and they were all back in their former positions the next day.Butler, by my directions, also made a demonstration on the north side ofthe James River in order to support this move, by detaining there theConfederate troops who were on that side. He succeeded in this, butfailed of further results by not marching past the enemy's left beforeturning in on the Darby road and by reason of simply coming up againsttheir lines in place.This closed active operations around Richmond for the winter. Of coursethere was frequent skirmishing between pickets, but no serious battlewas fought near either Petersburg or Richmond. It would prolong thiswork to give a detailed account of all that took place from day to dayaround Petersburg and at other parts of my command, and it would notinterest the general reader if given.  All these details can be found bythe military student in a series of books published by the Scribners,Badeau's history of my campaigns, and also in the publications of theWar Department, including both the National and Confederate reports.In the latter part of November General Hancock was relieved from thecommand of the 2d corps by the Secretary of War and ordered toWashington, to organize and command a corps of veteran troops to bedesignated the 1st corps.  It was expected that this would give him alarge command to co-operate with in the spring.  It was my expectation,at the time, that in the final operations Hancock should move either upthe valley, or else east of the Blue Ridge to Lynchburg; the idea beingto make the spring campaign the close of the war.  I expected, withSherman coming up from the South, Meade south of Petersburg and aroundRichmond, and Thomas's command in Tennessee with depots of suppliesestablished in the eastern part of that State, to move from thedirection of Washington or the valley towards Lynchburg.  We would thenhave Lee so surrounded that his supplies would be cut off entirely,making it impossible for him to support his army.General Humphreys, chief-of-staff of the Army of the Potomac, wasassigned to the command of the 2d corps, to succeed Hancock.
ISFP	 LIX.THE CAMPAIGN IN GEORGIA--SHERMAN'S MARCH TO THE SEA--WAR ANECDOTES--THEMARCH ON SAVANNAH--INVESTMENT OF SAVANNAH--CAPTURE OF SAVANNAH.Let us now return to the operations in the military division of theMississippi, and accompany Sherman in his march to the sea.The possession of Atlanta by us narrowed the territory of the enemy verymaterially and cut off one of his two remaining lines of roads from eastto west.A short time after the fall of Atlanta Mr. Davis visited Palmetto andMacon and made speeches at each place.  He spoke at Palmetto on the 20thof September, and at Macon on the 22d. Inasmuch as he had relievedJohnston and appointed Hood, and Hood had immediately taken theinitiative, it is natural to suppose that Mr. Davis was disappointedwith General Johnston's policy.  My own judgment is that Johnston actedvery wisely:  he husbanded his men and saved as much of his territory ashe could, without fighting decisive battles in which all might be lost.As Sherman advanced, as I have show, his army became spread out, until,if this had been continued, it would have been easy to destroy it indetail.  I know that both Sherman and I were rejoiced when we heard ofthe change.  Hood was unquestionably a brave, gallant soldier and notdestitute of ability; but unfortunately his policy was to fight theenemy wherever he saw him, without thinking much of the consequences ofdefeat.In his speeches Mr. Davis denounced Governor Brown, of Georgia, andGeneral Johnston in unmeasured terms, even insinuating that theirloyalty to the Southern cause was doubtful.  So far as General Johnstonis concerned, I think Davis did him a great injustice in thisparticular.  I had know the general before the war and strongly believedit would be impossible for him to accept a high commission for thepurpose of betraying the cause he had espoused.  There, as I have said,I think that his policy was the best one that could have been pursued bythe whole South--protract the war, which was all that was necessary toenable them to gain recognition in the end.  The North was alreadygrowing weary, as the South evidently was also, but with thisdifference.  In the North the people governed, and could stophostilities whenever they chose to stop supplies.  The South was amilitary camp, controlled absolutely by the government with soldiers toback it, and the war could have been protracted, no matter to whatextent the discontent reached, up to the point of open mutiny of thesoldiers themselves.  Mr. Davis's speeches were frank appeals to thepeople of Georgia and that portion of the South to come to their relief.He tried to assure his frightened hearers that the Yankees were rapidlydigging their own graves; that measures were already being taken to cutthem off from supplies from the North; and that with a force in front,and cut off from the rear, they must soon starve in the midst of ahostile people.  Papers containing reports of these speeches immediatelyreached the Northern States, and they were republished.  Of course, thatcaused no alarm so long as telegraphic communication was kept up withSherman.When Hood was forced to retreat from Atlanta he moved to the south-westand was followed by a portion of Sherman's army.  He soon appeared uponthe railroad in Sherman's rear, and with his whole army began destroyingthe road.  At the same time also the work was begun in Tennessee andKentucky which Mr. Davis had assured his hearers at Palmetto and Maconwould take place.  He ordered Forrest (about the ablest cavalry generalin the South) north for this purpose; and Forrest and Wheeler carriedout their orders with more or less destruction, occasionally picking upa garrison.  Forrest indeed performed the very remarkable feat ofcapturing, with cavalry, two gunboats and a number of transports,something the accomplishment of which is very hard to account for.Hood's army had been weakened by Governor Brown's withdrawing theGeorgia State troops for the purpose of gathering in the season's cropsfor the use of the people and for the use of the army.  This not onlydepleted Hood's forces but it served a most excellent purpose ingathering in supplies of food and forage for the use of our army in itssubsequent march.  Sherman was obliged to push on with his force and gohimself with portions of it hither and thither, until it was clearlydemonstrated to him that with the army he then had it would beimpossible to hold the line from Atlanta back and leave him any forcewhatever with which to take the offensive.  Had that plan been adheredto, very large reinforcements would have been necessary; and Mr. Davis'sprediction of the destruction of the army would have been realized, orelse Sherman would have been obliged to make a successful retreat, whichMr. Davis said in his speeches would prove more disastrous thanNapoleon's retreat from Moscow.These speeches of Mr. Davis were not long in reaching Sherman. He tookadvantage of the information they gave, and made all the preparationpossible for him to make to meet what now became expected, attempts tobreak his communications.  Something else had to be done:  and toSherman's sensible and soldierly mind the idea was not long in dawningupon him, not only that something else had to be done, but what thatsomething else should be.On September 10th I telegraphed Sherman as follows:CITY POINT, VA., Sept. 10, 1864.MAJOR-GENERAL SHERMAN, Atlanta, Georgia.So soon as your men are sufficiently rested, and preparations can bemade, it is desirable that another campaign should be commenced.  Wewant to keep the enemy constantly pressed to the end of the war.  If wegive him no peace whilst the war lasts, the end cannot be distant.  Nowthat we have all of Mobile Bay that is valuable, I do not know but itwill be the best move to transfer Canby's troops to act upon Savannah,whilst you move on Augusta. I should like to hear from you, however, inthis matter.U. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General.Sherman replied promptly:'If I could be sure of finding provisions and ammunition at Augusta, orColumbus, Georgia, I can march to Milledgeville, and compel Hood to giveup Augusta or Macon, and then turn on the other.  * * * If you canmanage to take the Savannah River as high up as Augusta, or theChattahoochee as far up as Columbus, I can sweep the whole State ofGeorgia.'On the 12th I sent a special messenger, one of my own staff, with aletter inviting Sherman's views about the next campaign.CITY POINT, VA., Sept. 12, 1864.MAJOR-GENERAL W. T.  SHERMAN, Commanding Mill Division of theMississippi.I send Lieutenant-Colonel Porter, of my staff, with this. Colonel Porterwill explain to you the exact condition of affairs here better than Ican do in the limits of a letter. Although I feel myself strong enoughfor offensive operations, I am holding on quietly to get advantage ofrecruits and convalescents, who are coming forward very rapidly.  Mylines are necessarily very long, extending from Deep Bottom north of theJames across the peninsula formed by the Appomattox and the James, andsouth of the Appomattox to the Weldon Road.  This line is very stronglyfortified, and can be held with comparatively few men, but from itsgreat length takes many in the aggregate.  I propose, when I do move, toextend my left so as to control what is known as the South Side, orLynchburg and Petersburg Road, then if possible to keep the DanvilleRoad cut.  At the same time this move is made, I want to send a force offrom six to ten thousand men against Wilmington.The way I propose to do this is to land the men north of Fort Fisher,and hold that point.  At the same time a large naval fleet will beassembled there, and the iron-clads will run the batteries as they didat Mobile.  This will give us the same control of the harbor ofWilmington that we now have of the harbor of Mobile. What you are to dowith the forces at your command, I do not see. The difficulties ofsupplying your army, except when you are constantly moving, beyond whereyou are, I plainly see.  If it had not been for Price's movements Canbywould have sent twelve thousand more men to Mobile.  From your commandon the Mississippi an equal number could have been taken.  With theseforces my idea would have been to divide them, sending one half toMobile and the other half to Savannah.  You could then move as proposedin your telegram, so as to threaten Macon and Augusta equally.Whichever was abandoned by the enemy you could take and open up a newbase of supplies.  My object now in sending a staff officer is not somuch to suggest operations for you, as to get your views and have plansmatured by the time everything can be got ready.  It will probably bethe 5th of October before any of the plans herein indicated will beexecuted.If you have any promotions to recommend, send the names forward and Iwill approve them. * * *U. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General.This reached Sherman on September 20th.On the 25th of September Sherman reported to Washington that Hood'stroops were in his rear.  He had provided against this by sending adivision to Chattanooga and a division to Rome, Georgia, which was inthe rear of Hood, supposing that Hood would fall back in the directionfrom which he had come to reach the railroad.  At the same time Shermanand Hood kept up a correspondence relative to the exchange of prisoners,the treatment of citizens, and other matters suitable to be arrangedbetween hostile commanders in the field.  On the 27th of September Itelegraphed Sherman as follows:CITY POINT, VA., September 27, 1864--10.30 A.M.MAJOR-GENERAL SHERMAN:I have directed all recruits and new troops from the Western States tobe sent to Nashville, to receive their further orders from you.  * * *U. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General.On the 29th Sherman sent Thomas back to Chattanooga, and afterwards toNashville, with another division (Morgan's) of the advanced army.Sherman then suggested that, when he was prepared, his movements shouldtake place against Milledgeville and then to Savannah.  His expectationat that time was, to make this movement as soon as he could get up hissupplies.  Hood was moving in his own country, and was moving light sothat he could make two miles to Sherman's one.  He depended upon thecountry to gather his supplies, and so was not affected by delays.As I have said, until this unexpected state of affairs happened, Mobilehad been looked upon as the objective point of Sherman's army.  It hadbeen a favorite move of mine from 1862, when I first suggested to thethen commander-in-chief that the troops in Louisiana, instead offrittering away their time in the trans-Mississippi, should moveagainst Mobile.  I recommended this from time to time until I came intocommand of the army, the last of March 1864.  Having the power in my ownhands, I now ordered the concentration of supplies, stores and troops,in the department of the Gulf about New Orleans, with a view to a moveagainst Mobile, in support of, and in conjunction with, the other armiesoperating in the field.  Before I came into command, these troops hadbeen scattered over the trans-Mississippi department in such a way thatthey could not be, or were not, gotten back in time to take any part inthe original movement; hence the consideration, which had caused Mobileto be selected as the objective point for Sherman's army to find hisnext base of supplies after having cut loose from Atlanta, no longerexisted.General G. M. Dodge, an exceedingly efficient officer, having been badlywounded, had to leave the army about the first of October. He was incommand of two divisions of the 16th corps, consolidated into one.Sherman then divided his army into the right and left wings the rightcommanded by General O. O. Howard and the left by General Slocum.General Dodge's two divisions were assigned, one to each of these wings.Howard's command embraced the 15th and 17th corps, and Slocum's the 14thand 20th corps, commanded by Generals Jeff. C. Davis and A. S. Williams.Generals Logan and Blair commanded the two corps composing the rightwing.  About this time they left to take part in the presidentialelection, which took place that year, leaving their corps to Osterhausand Ransom.  I have no doubt that their leaving was at the earnestsolicitation of the War Department. General Blair got back in time toresume his command and to proceed with it throughout the march to thesea and back to the grand review at Washington.  General Logan did notreturn to his command until after it reached Savannah.Logan felt very much aggrieved at the transfer of General Howard fromthat portion of the Army of the Potomac which was then with the WesternArmy, to the command of the Army of the Tennessee, with which armyGeneral Logan had served from the battle of Belmont to the fall ofAtlanta--having passed successively through all grades from colonelcommanding a regiment to general commanding a brigade, division and armycorps, until upon the death of McPherson the command of the entire Armyof the Tennessee devolved upon him in the midst of a hotly contestedbattle.  He conceived that he had done his full duty as commander inthat engagement; and I can bear testimony, from personal observation,that he had proved himself fully equal to all the lower positions whichhe had occupied as a soldier.  I will not pretend to question the motivewhich actuated Sherman in taking an officer from another army tosupersede General Logan.  I have no doubt, whatever, that he did thisfor what he considered would be to the good of the service, which wasmore important than that the personal feelings of any individual shouldnot be aggrieved; though I doubt whether he had an officer with him whocould have filled the place as Logan would have done.  Differences ofopinion must exist between the best of friends as to policies in war,and of judgment as to men's fitness.  The officer who has the command,however, should be allowed to judge of the fitness of the officers underhim, unless he is very manifestly wrong.Sherman's army, after all the depletions, numbered about sixty thousandeffective men.  All weak men had been left to hold the rear, and thoseremaining were not only well men, but strong and hardy, so that he hadsixty thousand as good soldiers as ever trod the earth; better than anyEuropean soldiers, because they not only worked like a machine but themachine thought. European armies know very little what they are fightingfor, and care less. Included in these sixty thousand troops, there weretwo small divisions of cavalry, numbering altogether about four thousandmen.  Hood had about thirty-five to forty thousand men, independent ofForrest, whose forces were operating in Tennessee and Kentucky, as Mr.Davis had promised they should.  This part of Mr. Davis's military planwas admirable, and promised the best results of anything he could havedone, according to my judgment. I say this because I have criticised hismilitary judgment in the removal of Johnston, and also in theappointment of Hood.  I am aware, however, that there was high feelingexisting at that time between Davis and his subordinate, whom I regardedas one of his ablest lieutenants.On the 5th of October the railroad back from Atlanta was again verybadly broken, Hood having got on the track with his army. Sherman sawafter night, from a high point, the road burning for miles.  The defenceof the railroad by our troops was very gallant, but they could not holdpoints between their intrenched positions against Hood's whole army; infact they made no attempt to do so; but generally the intrenchedpositions were held, as well as important bridges, and store located atthem. Allatoona, for instance, was defended by a small force of menunder the command of General Corse, one of the very able and efficientvolunteer officers produced by the war.  He, with a small force, was cutoff from the remainder of the National army and was attacked with greatvigor by many times his own number. Sherman from his high position couldsee the battle raging, with the Confederate troops between him and hissubordinate.  He sent men, of course, to raise the temporary siege, butthe time that would be necessarily consumed in reaching Corse, would beso great that all occupying the intrenchments might be dead.  Corse wasa man who would never surrender.  From a high position some of Sherman'ssignal corps discovered a signal flag waving from a hole in the blockhouse at Allatoona.  It was from Corse.  He had been shot through theface, but he signalled to his chief a message which left no doubt of hisdetermination to hold his post at all hazards.  It was at this pointprobably, that Sherman first realized that with the forces at hisdisposal, the keeping open of his line of communication with the Northwould be impossible if he expected to retain any force with which tooperate offensively beyond Atlanta.  He proposed, therefore, to destroythe roads back to Chattanooga, when all ready to move, and leave thelatter place garrisoned.  Yet, before abandoning the railroad, it wasnecessary that he should repair damages already done, and hold the roaduntil he could get forward such supplies, ordnance stores and smallrations, as he wanted to carry with him on his proposed march, and toreturn to the north his surplus artillery; his object being to movelight and to have no more artillery than could be used to advantage onthe field.Sherman thought Hood would follow him, though he proposed to prepare forthe contingency of the latter moving the other way while he was movingsouth, by making Thomas strong enough to hold Tennessee and Kentucky.I, myself, was thoroughly satisfied that Hood would go north, as he did.On the 2d of November I telegraphed Sherman authorizing him definitelyto move according to the plan he had proposed:  that is, cutting loosefrom his base, giving up Atlanta and the railroad back to Chattanooga.To strengthen Thomas he sent Stanley (4th corps) back, and also orderedSchofield, commanding the Army of the Ohio, twelve thousand strong, toreport to him.  In addition to this, A. J. Smith, who, with twodivisions of Sherman's army, was in Missouri aiding Rosecrans in drivingthe enemy from that State, was under orders to return to Thomas and,under the most unfavorable circumstances, might be expected to arrivethere long before Hood could reach Nashville.In addition to this, the new levies of troops that were being raised inthe  North-west went to Thomas as rapidly as enrolled and equipped.Thomas, without any of these additions spoken of, had a garrison atChattanooga which had been strengthened by one division and garrisons atBridgeport, Stevenson, Decatur, Murfreesboro, and Florence.  There werealready with him in Nashville ten thousand soldiers in round numbers,and many thousands of employees in the quartermaster's and otherdepartments who could be put in the intrenchments in front of Nashville,for its defence.  Also, Wilson was there with ten thousand dismountedcavalrymen, who were being equipped for the field.  Thomas had at thistime about forty-five thousand men without any of the reinforcementshere above enumerated.  These reinforcements gave him  altogether aboutseventy thousand men, without counting what might be added by the newlevies already spoken of.About this time Beauregard arrived upon the field, not to supersede Hoodin command, but to take general charge over the entire district in whichHood and Sherman were, or might be, operating.  He made the most franticappeals to the citizens for assistance to be rendered in every way:  bysending reinforcements, by destroying supplies on the line of march ofthe invaders, by destroying the bridges over which they would have tocross, and by, in every way, obstructing the roads to their front. Butit was hard to convince the people of the propriety of destroyingsupplies which were so much needed by themselves, and each one hopedthat his own possessions might escape.Hood soon started north, and went into camp near Decatur, Alabama, wherehe remained until the 29th of October, but without making an attack onthe garrison of that place.The Tennessee River was patrolled by gunboats, from Muscle Shoals east;and, also, below the second shoals out to the Ohio River.  These, withthe troops that might be concentrated from the garrisons along the riverat any point where Hood might choose to attempt to cross, made itimpossible for him to cross the Tennessee at any place where it wasnavigable.  But Muscle Shoals is not navigable, and below them again isanother shoal which also obstructs navigation.  Hood therefore moveddown to a point nearly opposite Florence, Alabama, crossed over andremained there for some time, collecting supplies of food, forage andammunition. All of these had to come from a considerable distance south,because the region in which he was then situated was mountainous, withsmall valleys which produced but little, and what they had produced hadlong since been exhausted.  On the 1st of November I suggested toSherman, and also asked his views thereon, the propriety of destroyingHood before he started on his campaign.On the 2d of November, as stated, I approved definitely his making hisproposed campaign through Georgia, leaving Hood behind to the tendermercy of Thomas and the troops in his command.  Sherman fixed the 10thof November as the day of starting.Sherman started on that day to get back to Atlanta, and on the 15th thereal march to the sea commenced.  The right wing, under Howard, and thecavalry went to Jonesboro, Milledgeville, then the capital of Georgia,being Sherman's objective or stopping place on the way to Savannah.  Theleft wing moved to Stone Mountain, along roads much farther east thanthose taken by the right wing. Slocum was in command, and threatenedAugusta as the point to which he was moving, but he was to turn off andmeet the right wing at Milledgeville.Atlanta was destroyed so far as to render it worthless for militarypurposes before starting, Sherman himself remaining over a day tosuperintend the work, and see that it was well done. Sherman's ordersfor this campaign were perfect.  Before starting, he had sent back allsick, disabled and weak men, retaining nothing but the hardy,well-inured soldiers to accompany him on his long march in prospect.His artillery was reduced to sixty-five guns. The ammunition carriedwith them was two hundred rounds for musket and gun.  Small rations weretaken in a small wagon train, which was loaded to its capacity for rapidmovement.  The army was expected to live on the country, and to alwayskeep the wagons full of forage and provisions against a possible delayof a few days.The troops, both of the right and left wings, made most of their advancealong the line of railroads, which they destroyed.  The method adoptedto perform this work, was to burn and destroy all the bridges andculverts, and for a long distance, at places, to tear up the track andbend the rails.  Soldiers to do this rapidly would form a line along oneside of the road with crowbars and poles, place these under the railsand, hoisting all at once, turn over many rods of road at one time.  Theties would then be placed in piles, and the rails, as they wereloosened, would be carried and put across these log heaps.  When asufficient number of rails were placed upon a pile of ties it would beset on fire.  This would heat the rails very much more in the middle,that being over the main part of the fire, than at the ends, so thatthey would naturally bend of their own weight; but the soldiers, toincrease the damage, would take tongs and, one or two men at each end ofthe rail, carry it with force against the nearest tree and twist itaround, thus leaving rails forming bands to ornament the forest trees ofGeorgia. All this work was going on at the same time, there being asufficient number of men detailed for that purpose. Some piled the logsand built the fire; some put the rails upon the fire; while others wouldbend those that were sufficiently heated: so that, by the time the lastbit of road was torn up, that it was designed to destroy at a certainplace, the rails previously taken up were already destroyed.The organization for supplying the army was very complete.  Each brigadefurnished a company to gather supplies of forage and provisions for thecommand to which they belonged.  Strict injunctions were issued againstpillaging, or otherwise unnecessarily annoying the people; buteverything in shape of food for man and forage for beast was taken.  Thesupplies were turned over to the brigade commissary and quartermaster,and were issued by them to their respective commands precisely the sameas if they had been purchased.  The captures consisted largely ofcattle, sheep, poultry, some bacon, cornmeal, often molasses, andoccasionally coffee or other small rations.The skill of these men, called by themselves and the army 'bummers,' incollecting their loads and getting back to their respective commands,was marvellous.  When they started out in the morning, they were alwayson foot; but scarcely one of them returned in the evening without beingmounted on a horse or mule. These would be turned in for the general useof the army, and the next day these men would start out afoot and returnagain in the evening mounted.Many of the exploits of these men would fall under the head of romance;indeed, I am afraid that in telling some of their experiences, theromance got the better of the truth upon which the story was founded,and that, in the way many of these anecdotes are told, very little ofthe foundation is left.  I suspect that most of them consist chiefly ofthe fiction added to make the stories better.  In one instance it wasreported that a few men of Sherman's army passed a house where theydiscovered some chickens under the dwelling.  They immediately proceededto capture them, to add to the army's supplies.  The lady of the house,who happened to be at home, made piteous appeals to have these spared,saying they were a few she had put away to save by permission of otherparties who had preceded and who had taken all the others that she had.The soldiers seemed moved at her appeal; but looking at the chickensagain they were tempted and one of them replied:  'The rebellion must besuppressed if it takes the last chicken in the Confederacy,' andproceeded to appropriate the last one.Another anecdote characteristic of these times has been told. The South,prior to the rebellion, kept bloodhounds to pursue runaway slaves whotook refuge in the neighboring swamps, and also to hunt convicts.Orders were issued to kill all these animals as they were met with.  Onone occasion a soldier picked up a poodle, the favorite pet of itsmistress, and was carrying it off to execution when the lady made astrong appeal to him to spare it. The soldier replied, 'Madam, ourorders are to kill every bloodhound.'  'But this is not a bloodhound,'said the lady.  'Well, madam, we cannot tell what it will grow into ifwe leave it behind,' said the soldier as he went off with it.Notwithstanding these anecdotes, and the necessary hardship they wouldseem to imply, I do not believe there was much unwarrantable pillagingconsidering that we were in the enemy's territory and without anysupplies except such as the country afforded.On the 23d Sherman, with the left wing, reached Milledgeville. The rightwing was not far off:  but proceeded on its way towards Savannahdestroying the road as it went.  The troops at Milledgeville remainedover a day to destroy factories, buildings used for military purposes,etc., before resuming its march.The governor, who had been almost defying Mr. Davis before this, nowfled precipitately, as did the legislature of the State and all theState officers.  The governor, Sherman says, was careful to carry awayeven his garden vegetables, while he left the archives of the State tofall into our hands.  The only military force that was opposed toSherman's forward march was the Georgia militia, a division under thecommand of General G. W. Smith, and a battalion under Harry Wayne.Neither the quality of the forces nor their numbers was sufficient toeven retard the progress of Sherman's army.The people at the South became so frantic at this time at the successfulinvasion of Georgia that they took the cadets from the military collegeand added them to the ranks of the militia.  They even liberated theState convicts under promise from them that they would serve in thearmy.  I have but little doubt that the worst acts that were attributedto Sherman's army were committed by these convicts, and by otherSouthern people who ought to have been under sentence--such people ascould be found in every community, North and South--who took advantageof their country being invaded to commit crime.  They were in but littledanger of detection, or of arrest even if detected.The Southern papers in commenting upon Sherman's movements pictured himas in the most deplorable condition:  stating that his men werestarving, that they were demoralized and wandering about almost withoutobject, aiming only to reach the sea coast and get under the protectionof our navy.  These papers got to the North and had more or less effectupon the minds of the people, causing much distress to all loyal personsparticularly to those who had husbands, sons or brothers with Sherman.Mr. Lincoln seeing these accounts, had a letter written asking me if Icould give him anything that he could say to the loyal people that wouldcomfort them.  I told him there was not the slightest occasion foralarm; that with 60,000 such men as Sherman had with him, such acommanding officer as he was could not be cut off in the open country.He might possibly be prevented from reaching the point he had startedout to reach, but he would get through somewhere and would finally getto his chosen destination:  and even if worst came to worst he couldreturn North.  I heard afterwards of Mr. Lincoln's saying, to those whowould inquire of him as to what he thought about the safety of Sherman'sarmy, that Sherman was all right:  'Grant says they are safe with such ageneral, and that if they cannot get out where they want to, they cancrawl back by the hole they went in at.'While at Milledgeville the soldiers met at the State House, organized alegislature, and proceeded to business precisely as if they were thelegislative body belonging to the State of Georgia. The debates wereexciting, and were upon the subject of the situation the South was in atthat time, particularly the State of Georgia.  They went so far as torepeal, after a spirited and acrimonious debate, the ordinance ofsecession.The next day (24th) Sherman continued his march, going by the way ofWaynesboro and Louisville, Millen being the next objective and where thetwo columns (the right and left wings) were to meet.  The left wingmoved to the left of the direct road, and the cavalry still farther offso as to make it look as though Augusta was the point they were aimingfor.  They moved on all the roads they could find leading in thatdirection.  The cavalry was sent to make a rapid march in hope ofsurprising Millen before the Union prisoners could be carried away; butthey failed in this.The distance from Milledgeville to Millen was about one hundred miles.At this point Wheeler, who had been ordered from Tennessee, arrived andswelled the numbers and efficiency of the troops confronting Sherman.Hardee, a native of Georgia, also came, but brought no troops with him.It was intended that he should raise as large an army as possible withwhich to intercept Sherman's march.  He did succeed in raising sometroops, and with these and those under the command of Wheeler and Wayne,had an army sufficient to cause some annoyance but no great detention.Our cavalry and Wheeler's had a pretty severe engagement, in whichWheeler was driven towards Augusta, thus giving the idea that Shermanwas probably making for that point.Millen was reached on the 3d of December, and the march was resumed thefollowing day for Savannah, the final objective. Bragg had now been sentto Augusta with some troops.  Wade Hampton was there also trying toraise cavalry sufficient to destroy Sherman's army.  If he ever raised aforce it was too late to do the work expected of it.  Hardee's wholeforce probably numbered less than ten thousand men.From Millen to Savannah the country is sandy and poor, and affords butvery little forage other than rice straw, which was then growing.  Thisanswered a very good purpose as forage, and the rice grain was anaddition to the soldier's rations.  No further resistance worthy of notewas met with, until within a few miles of Savannah.  This place wasfound to be intrenched and garrisoned.  Sherman proceeded at once on hisarrival to invest the place, and found that the enemy had placedtorpedoes in the ground, which were to explode when stepped on by man orbeast. One of these exploded under an officer's horse, blowing theanimal to pieces and tearing one of the legs of the officer so badlythat it had to be amputated.  Sherman at once ordered his prisoners tothe front, moving them in a compact body in advance, to either explodethe torpedoes or dig them up.  No further explosion took place.On the 10th of December the siege of Savannah commenced. Sherman then,before proceeding any further with operations for the capture of theplace, started with some troops to open communication with our fleet,which he expected to find in the lower harbor or as near by as the fortsof the enemy would permit. In marching to the coast he encountered FortMcAllister, which it was necessary to reduce before the supplies hemight find on shipboard could be made available.  Fort McAllister wassoon captured by an assault made by General Hazen's division.Communication was then established with the fleet.  The capture ofSavannah then only occupied a few days, and involved no great loss oflife.  The garrison, however, as we shall see, was enabled to escape bycrossing the river and moving eastward.When Sherman had opened communication with the fleet he found there asteamer, which I had forwarded to him, carrying the accumulated mailsfor his army, also supplies which I supposed he would be in need of.General J. G. Foster, who commanded all the troops south of NorthCarolina on the Atlantic sea-board, visited General Sherman before hehad opened communication with the fleet, with the view of ascertainingwhat assistance he could be to him.  Foster returned immediately to hisown headquarters at Hilton Head, for the purpose of sending Shermansiege guns, and also if he should find he had them to spare, supplies ofclothing, hard bread, etc., thinking that these articles might not befound outside.  The mail on the steamer which I sent down, had beencollected by Colonel A. H. Markland of the Post Office Department, whowent in charge of it.  On this same vessel I sent an officer of my staff(Lieutenant Dunn) with the following letter to General Sherman:CITY POINT, VA., Dec. 3, 1864.MAJOR-GENERAL W. T.  SHERMAN, Commanding Armies near Savannah, Ga.The little information gleaned from the Southern press, indicating nogreat obstacle to your progress, I have directed your mails (which hadbeen previously collected at Baltimore by Colonel Markland, SpecialAgent of the Post Office Department) to be sent as far as the blockadingsquadron off Savannah, to be forwarded to you as soon as heard from onthe coast.Not liking to rejoice before the victory is assured, I abstain fromcongratulating you and those under your command, until bottom has beenstruck.  I have never had a fear, however, for the result.Since you left Atlanta, no very great progress has been made here. Theenemy has been closely watched though, and prevented from detachingagainst you.  I think not one man has gone from here, except some twelveor fifteen hundred dismounted cavalry.  Bragg has gone from Wilmington.I am trying to take advantage of his absence to get possession of thatplace.  Owing to some preparations Admiral Porter and General Butler aremaking to blow up Fort Fisher (which, while hoping for the best, I donot believe a particle in), there is a delay in getting this expeditionoff.  I hope they will be ready to start by the 7th, and that Bragg willnot have started back by that time.In this letter I do not intend to give you anything like directions forfuture action, but will state a general idea I have, and will get yourviews after you have established yourself on the sea-coast. With yourveteran army I hope to get control of the only two through routes fromeast to west possessed by the enemy before the fall of Atlanta.  Thecondition will be filled by holding Savannah and Augusta, or by holdingany other port to the east of Savannah and Branchville.  If Wilmingtonfalls, a force from there can co-operate with you.Thomas has got back into the defences of Nashville, with Hood close uponhim.  Decatur has been abandoned, and so have all the roads except themain one leading to Chattanooga.  Part of this falling back wasundoubtedly necessary and all of it may have been.  It did not look so,however, to me.  In my opinion, Thomas far outnumbers Hood in infantry.In cavalry, Hood has the advantage in morale and numbers.  I hope yetthat Hood will be badly crippled if not destroyed.  The general news youwill learn from the papers better than I could give it.After all becomes quiet, and roads become so bad up here that there islikely to be a week or two when nothing can be done, I will run down thecoast to see you.  If you desire it, I will ask Mrs. Sherman to go withme.Yours truly, U. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-GeneralI quote this letter because it gives the reader a full knowledge of theevents of that period.Sherman now (the 15th) returned to Savannah to complete its investmentand insure the surrender of the garrison.  The country about Savannah islow and marshy, and the city was well intrenched from the river above tothe river below; and assaults could not be made except along acomparatively narrow causeway. For this reason assaults must haveresulted in serious destruction of life to the Union troops, with thechance of failing altogether. Sherman therefore decided upon a completeinvestment of the place.  When he believed this investment completed, hesummoned the garrison to surrender.  General Hardee, who was in command,replied in substance that the condition of affairs was not such asSherman had described.  He said he was in full communication with hisdepartment and was receiving supplies constantly.Hardee, however, was cut off entirely from all communication with thewest side of the river, and by the river itself to the north and south.On the South Carolina side the country was all rice fields, throughwhich it would have been impossible to bring supplies so that Hardee hadno possible communication with the outside world except by a dilapidatedplank road starting from the west bank of the river.  Sherman, receivingthis reply, proceeded in person to a point on the coast, where GeneralFoster had troops stationed under General Hatch, for the purpose ofmaking arrangements with the latter officer to go through by one of thenumerous channels running inland along that part of the coast of SouthCarolina, to the plank road which General Hardee still possessed, andthus to cut him off from the last means he had of getting supplies, ifnot of communication.While arranging for this movement, and before the attempt to execute theplan had been commenced, Sherman received information through one of hisstaff officers that the enemy had evacuated Savannah the night before.This was the night of the 21st of December.  Before evacuating the placeHardee had blown up the navy yard.  Some iron-clads had been destroyed,as well as other property that might have been valuable to us; but heleft an immense amount of stores untouched, consisting of cotton,railroad cars, workshops, numerous pieces of artillery, and severalthousand stands of small arms.A little incident occurred, soon after the fall of Savannah, whichSherman relates in his Memoirs, and which is worthy of repetition.Savannah was one of the points where blockade runners entered. Shortlyafter the city fell into our possession, a blockade runner came sailingup serenely, not doubting but the Confederates were still in possession.It was not molested, and the captain did not find out his mistake untilhe had tied up and gone to the Custom House, where he found a newoccupant of the building, and made a less profitable disposition of hisvessel and cargo than he had expected.As there was some discussion as to the authorship of Sherman's march tothe sea, by critics of his book when it appeared before the public, Iwant to state here that no question upon that subject was ever raisedbetween General Sherman and myself. Circumstances made the plan on whichSherman expected to act impracticable, as as commander of the forces henecessarily had to devise a new on which would give more promise ofsuccess: consequently he recommended the destruction of the railroadback to Chattanooga, and that he should be authorized then to move, ashe did, from Atlanta forward.  His suggestions were finally approved,although they did not immediately find favor in Washington.  Even whenit came to the time of starting, the greatest apprehension, as to thepropriety of the campaign he was about commence, filled the mind of thePresident, induced no doubt by his advisers.  This went so far as tomove the President to ask me to suspend Sherman's march for a day or twountil I could think the matter over.  My recollection is, though I findno record to show it, that out of deference to the President's wish Idid send a dispatch to Sherman asking him to wait a day or two, or elsethe connections between us were already cut so that I could not do so.However this may be, the question of who devised the plan of march fromAtlanta to Savannah is easily answered:  it was clearly Sherman, and tohim also belongs the credit of its brilliant execution.  It was hardlypossible that any one else than those on the spot could have devised anew plan of campaign to supersede one that did not promise success.(*40)I was in favor of Sherman's plan from the time it was first submitted tome.  My chief of staff, however, was very bitterly opposed to it and, asI learned subsequently, finding that he could not move me, he appealedto the authorities at Washington to stop it.
ISFP	 LX.THE BATTLE OF FRANKLIN--THE BATTLE OF NASHVILLE.As we have seen, Hood succeeded in crossing the Tennessee River betweenMuscle Shoals and the lower shoals at the end of October, 1864.  Thomassent Schofield with the 4th and 23d corps, together with three brigadesof Wilson's cavalry to Pulaski to watch him.  On the 17th of NovemberHood started and moved in such a manner as to avoid Schofield, therebyturning his position.  Hood had with him three infantry corps, commandedrespectively by Stephen D. Lee, Stewart and Cheatham.  These, with hiscavalry, numbered about forty-five thousand men. Schofield had, of allarms, about thirty thousand.  Thomas's orders were, therefore, forSchofield to watch the movements of the enemy, but not to fight a battleif he could avoid it; but to fall back in case of an advance onNashville, and to fight the enemy, as he fell back, so as to retard theenemy's movements until he could be reinforced by Thomas himself.  Assoon as Schofield saw this movement of Hood's, he sent his trains to therear, but did not fall back himself until the 21st, and then only toColumbia.  At Columbia there was a slight skirmish but no battle.  Fromthis place Schofield then retreated to Franklin.  He had sent his wagonsin advance, and Stanley had gone with them with two divisions to protectthem.  Cheatham's corps of Hood's army pursued the wagon train and wentinto camp at Spring Hill, for the night of the 29th.Schofield retreating from Columbia on the 29th, passed Spring Hill,where Cheatham was bivouacked, during the night without molestation,though within half a mile of where the Confederates were encamped.  Onthe morning of the 30th he had arrived at Franklin.Hood followed closely and reached Franklin in time to make an attack thesame day.  The fight was very desperate and sanguinary.  The Confederategenerals led their men in the repeated charges, and the loss among themwas of unusual proportions.  This fighting continued with great severityuntil long after the night closed in, when the Confederates drew off.General Stanley, who commanded two divisions of the Union troops, andwhose troops bore the brunt of the battle, was wounded in the fight, butmaintained his position.The enemy's loss at Franklin, according to Thomas's report, was 1,750buried upon the field by our troops, 3,800 in the hospital, and 702prisoners besides.  Schofield's loss, as officially reported, was 189killed, 1,033 wounded, and 1,104 captured and missing.Thomas made no effort to reinforce Schofield at Franklin, as it seemedto me at the time he should have done, and fight out the battle there.He simply ordered Schofield to continue his retreat to Nashville, whichthe latter did during that night and the next day.Thomas, in the meantime, was making his preparations to receive Hood.The road to Chattanooga was still well guarded with strong garrisons atMurfreesboro, Stevenson, Bridgeport and Chattanooga.  Thomas hadpreviously given up Decatur and had been reinforced by A. J. Smith's twodivisions just returned from Missouri.  He also had Steedman's divisionand R. S. Granger's, which he had drawn from the front.  Hisquartermaster's men, about ten thousand in number, had been organizedand armed under the command of the chief quartermaster, General J. L.Donaldson, and placed in the fortifications under the generalsupervision of General Z. B. Tower, of the United States Engineers.Hood was allowed to move upon Nashville, and to invest that place almostwithout interference.  Thomas was strongly fortified in his position, sothat he would have been safe against the attack of Hood.  He had troopsenough even to annihilate him in the open field.  To me his delay wasunaccountable--sitting there and permitting himself to be invested, sothat, in the end, to raise the siege he would have to fight the enemystrongly posted behind fortifications.  It is true the weather was verybad.  The rain was falling and freezing as it fell, so that the groundwas covered with a sheet of ice, that made it very difficult to move.But I was afraid that the enemy would find means of moving, elude Thomasand manage to get north of the Cumberland River.  If he did this, Iapprehended most serious results from the campaign in the North, and wasafraid we might even have to send troops from the East to head him offif he got there, General Thomas's movements being always so deliberateand so slow, though effective in defence.I consequently urged Thomas in frequent dispatches sent from CityPoint(*41) to make the attack at once.  The country was alarmed, theadministration was alarmed, and I was alarmed lest the very thing wouldtake place which I have just described that is, Hood would get north.It was all without avail further than to elicit dispatches from Thomassaying that he was getting ready to move as soon as he could, that hewas making preparations, etc.  At last I had to say to General Thomasthat I should be obliged to remove him unless he acted promptly.  Hereplied that he was very sorry, but he would move as soon as he could.General Logan happening to visit City Point about that time, and knowinghim as a prompt, gallant and efficient officer, I gave him an order toproceed to Nashville to relieve Thomas.  I directed him, however, not todeliver the order or publish it until he reached there, and if Thomashad moved, then not to deliver it at all, but communicate with me bytelegraph.  After Logan started, in thinking over the situation, Ibecame restless, and concluded to go myself.  I went as far asWashington City, when a dispatch was received from General Thomasannouncing his readiness at last to move, and designating the time ofhis movement.  I concluded to wait until that time. He did move, and wassuccessful from the start.  This was on the 15th of December.  GeneralLogan was at Louisville at the time this movement was made, andtelegraphed the fact to Washington, and proceeded no farther himself.The battle during the 15th was severe, but favorable to the Uniontroops, and continued until night closed in upon the combat.  The nextday the battle was renewed.  After a successful assault upon Hood's menin their intrenchments the enemy fled in disorder, routed and broken,leaving their dead, their artillery and small arms in great numbers onthe field, besides the wounded that were captured.  Our cavalry hadfought on foot as infantry, and had not their horses with them; so thatthey were not ready to join in the pursuit the moment the enemyretreated.  They sent back, however, for their horses, and endeavored toget to Franklin ahead of Hood's broken army by the Granny White Road,but too much time was consumed in getting started.  They had got but afew miles beyond the scene of the battle when they found the enemy'scavalry dismounted and behind intrenchments covering the road on whichthey were advancing. Here another battle ensued, our men dismounting andfighting on foot, in which the Confederates were again routed and drivenin great disorder.  Our cavalry then went into bivouac, and renewed thepursuit on the following morning.  They were too late.  The enemyalready had possession of Franklin, and was beyond them. It now became achase in which the Confederates had the lead.Our troops continued the pursuit to within a few miles of Columbia,where they found the rebels had destroyed the railroad bridge as well asall other bridges over Duck River.  The heavy rains of a few days beforehad swelled the stream into a mad torrent, impassable except on bridges.Unfortunately, either through a mistake in the wording of the order orotherwise, the pontoon bridge which was to have been sent by rail out toFranklin, to be taken thence with the pursuing column, had gone towardChattanooga.  There was, consequently, a delay of some four days inbuilding bridges out of the remains of the old railroad bridge.  Ofcourse Hood got such a start in this time that farther pursuit wasuseless, although it was continued for some distance, but without comingupon him again.
ISFP	 LXI.EXPEDITION AGAINST FORT FISHER--ATTACK ON THE FORT--FAILURE OF THEEXPEDITION--SECOND EXPEDITION AGAINST THE FORT--CAPTURE OF FORT FISHER.Up to January, 1865, the enemy occupied Fort Fisher, at the mouth ofCape Fear River and below the City of Wilmington.  This port was ofimmense importance to the Confederates, because it formed theirprincipal inlet for blockade runners by means of which they brought infrom abroad such supplies and munitions of war as they could not produceat home.  It was equally important to us to get possession of it, notonly because it was desirable to cut off their supplies so as to insurea speedy termination of the war, but also because foreign governments,particularly the British Government, were constantly threatening thatunless ours could maintain the blockade of that coast they should ceaseto recognize any blockade.  For these reasons I determined, with theconcurrence of the Navy Department, in December, to send an expeditionagainst Fort Fisher for the purpose of capturing it.To show the difficulty experienced in maintaining the blockade, I willmention a circumstance that took place at Fort Fisher after its fall.Two English blockade runners came in at night.  Their commanders, notsupposing the fort had fallen, worked their way through all our fleetand got into the river unobserved.  They then signalled the fort,announcing their arrival.  There was a colored man in the fort who hadbeen there before and who understood these signals.  He informed GeneralTerry what reply he should make to have them come in, and Terry did ashe advised.  The vessels came in, their officers entirely unconsciousthat they were falling into the hands of the Union forces.  Even afterthey were brought in to the fort they were entertained in conversationfor some little time before suspecting that the Union troops wereoccupying the fort.  They were finally informed that their vessels andcargoes were prizes.I selected General Weitzel, of the Army of the James, to go with theexpedition, but gave instructions through General Butler.  He commandedthe department within whose geographical limits Fort Fisher wassituated, as well as Beaufort and other points on that coast held by ourtroops; he was, therefore, entitled to the right of fitting out theexpedition against Fort Fisher.General Butler conceived the idea that if a steamer loaded heavily withpowder could be run up to near the shore under the fort and exploded, itwould create great havoc and make the capture an easy matter.  AdmiralPorter, who was to command the naval squadron, seemed to fall in withthe idea, and it was not disapproved of in Washington; the navy wastherefore given the task of preparing the steamer for this purpose.  Ihad no confidence in the success of the scheme, and so expressed myself;but as no serious harm could come of the experiment, and the authoritiesat Washington seemed desirous to have it tried, I permitted it.  Thesteamer was sent to Beaufort, North Carolina, and was there loaded withpowder and prepared for the part she was to play in the reduction ofFort Fisher.General Butler chose to go in command of the expedition himself, and wasall ready to sail by the 9th of December (1864).  Very heavy stormsprevailed, however, at that time along that part of the sea-coast, andprevented him from getting off until the 13th or 14th.  His advancearrived off Fort Fisher on the 15th.  The naval force had been alreadyassembled, or was assembling, but they were obliged to run into Beaufortfor munitions, coal, etc.; then, too, the powder-boat was not yet fullyprepared. The fleet was ready to proceed on the 18th; but Butler, whohad remained outside from the 15th up to that time, now found himselfout of coal, fresh water, etc., and had to put into Beaufort toreplenish.  Another storm overtook him, and several days more were lostbefore the army and navy were both ready at the same time to co-operate.On the night of the 23d the powder-boat was towed in by a gunboat asnear to the fort as it was safe to run.  She was then propelled by herown machinery to within about five hundred yards of the shore.  Therethe clockwork, which was to explode her within a certain length of time,was set and she was abandoned.  Everybody left, and even the vessels putout to sea to prevent the effect of the explosion upon them.  At twoo'clock in the morning the explosion took place--and produced no moreeffect on the fort, or anything else on land, than the bursting of aboiler anywhere on the Atlantic Ocean would have done.  Indeed when thetroops in Fort Fisher heard the explosion they supposed it was thebursting of a boiler in one of the Yankee gunboats.Fort Fisher was situated upon a low, flat peninsula north of Cape FearRiver.  The soil is sandy.  Back a little the peninsula is very heavilywooded, and covered with fresh-water swamps.  The fort ran across thispeninsula, about five hundred yards in width, and extended along the seacoast about thirteen hundred yards.  The fort had an armament of 21 gunsand 3 mortars on the land side, and 24 guns on the sea front.  At thattime it was only garrisoned by four companies of infantry, one lightbattery and the gunners at the heavy guns less than seven hundred menwith a reserve of less than a thousand men five miles up the peninsula.General Whiting of the Confederate army was in command, and GeneralBragg was in command of the force at Wilmington.  Both commenced callingfor reinforcements the moment they saw our troops landing.  The Governorof North Carolina called for everybody who could stand behind a parapetand shoot a gun, to join them.  In this way they got two or threehundred additional men into Fort Fisher; and Hoke's division, five orsix thousand strong, was sent down from Richmond.  A few of these troopsarrived the very day that Butler was ready to advance.On the 24th the fleet formed for an attack in arcs of concentriccircles, their heavy iron-clads going in very close range, being nearestthe shore, and leaving intervals or spaces so that the outer vesselscould fire between them.  Porter was thus enabled to throw one hundredand fifteen shells per minute.  The damage done to the fort by theseshells was very slight, only two or three cannon being disabled in thefort.  But the firing silenced all the guns by making it too hot for themen to maintain their positions about them and compelling them to seekshelter in the bomb-proofs.On the next day part of Butler's troops under General Adelbert Ameseffected a landing out of range of the fort without difficulty.  Thiswas accomplished under the protection of gunboats sent for the purpose,and under cover of a renewed attack upon the fort by the fleet.  Theyformed a line across the peninsula and advanced, part going north andpart toward the fort, covering themselves as they did so.  Curtis pushedforward and came near to Fort Fisher, capturing the small garrison atwhat was called the Flag Pond Battery.  Weitzel accompanied him towithin a half a mile of the works.  Here he saw that the fort had notbeen injured, and so reported to Butler, advising against an assault.Ames, who had gone north in his advance, captured 228 of the reserves.These prisoners reported to Butler that sixteen hundred of Hoke'sdivision of six thousand from Richmond had already arrived and the restwould soon be in his rear.Upon these reports Butler determined to withdraw his troops from thepeninsula and return to the fleet.  At that time there had not been aman on our side injured except by one of the shells from the fleet.Curtis had got within a few yards of the works.  Some of his men hadsnatched a flag from the parapet of the fort, and others had taken ahorse from the inside of the stockade.  At night Butler informed Porterof his withdrawal, giving the reasons above stated, and announced hispurpose as soon as his men could embark to start for Hampton Roads.Porter represented to him that he had sent to Beaufort for moreammunition.  He could fire much faster than he had been doing, and wouldkeep the enemy from showing himself until our men were within twentyyards of the fort, and he begged that Butler would leave some bravefellows like those who had snatched the flag from the parapet and takenthe horse from the fort.Butler was unchangeable.  He got all his troops aboard, except Curtis'sbrigade, and started back.  In doing this, Butler made a fearfulmistake.  My instructions to him, or to the officer who went in commandof the expedition, were explicit in the statement that to effect alanding would be of itself a great victory, and if one should beeffected, the foothold must not be relinquished; on the contrary, aregular siege of the fort must be commenced and, to guard againstinterference by reason of storms, supplies of provisions must be laid inas soon as they could be got on shore.  But General Butler seems to havelost sight of this part of his instructions, and was back at Fort Monroeon the 28th.I telegraphed to the President as follows:CITY POINT, VA., Dec. 28, 1864.--8.30 P.M.The Wilmington expedition has proven a gross and culpable failure.  Manyof the troops are back here.  Delays and free talk of the object of theexpedition enabled the enemy to move troops to Wilmington to defeat it.After the expedition sailed from Fort Monroe, three days of fine weatherwere squandered, during which the enemy was without a force to protecthimself. Who is to blame will, I hope, be known.U. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General.Porter sent dispatches to the Navy Department in which he complainedbitterly of having been abandoned by the army just when the fort wasnearly in our possession, and begged that our troops might be sent backagain to cooperate, but with a different commander.  As soon as I heardthis I sent a messenger to Porter with a letter asking him to hold on.I assured him that I fully sympathized with him in his disappointment,and that I would send the same troops back with a different commander,with some reinforcements to offset those which the enemy had received.I told him it would take some little time to get transportation for theadditional troops; but as soon as it could be had the men should be ontheir way to him, and there would be no delay on my part.  I selected A.H. Terry to command.It was the 6th of January before the transports could be got ready andthe troops aboard.  They sailed from Fortress Monroe on that day.  Theobject and destination of the second expedition were at the time kept asecret to all except a few in the Navy Department and in the army towhom it was necessary to impart the information.  General Terry had notthe slightest idea of where he was going or what he was to do.  Hesimply knew that he was going to sea and that he had his orders withhim, which were to be opened when out at sea.He was instructed to communicate freely with Porter and have entireharmony between army and navy, because the work before them wouldrequire the best efforts of both arms of service. They arrived offBeaufort on the 8th. A heavy storm, however, prevented a landing atForth Fisher until the 13th.  The navy prepared itself for attack aboutas before, and the same time assisted the army in landing, this timefive miles away.  Only iron-clads fired at first; the object being todraw the fire of the enemy's guns so as to ascertain their positions.This object being accomplished, they then let in their shots thick andfast.  Very soon the guns were all silenced, and the fort showed evidentsigns of being much injured.Terry deployed his men across the peninsula as had been done before, andat two o'clock on the following morning was up within two miles of thefort with a respectable abatis in front of his line. His artillery wasall landed on that day, the 14th.  Again Curtis's brigade of Ame'sdivision had the lead. By noon they had carried an unfinished work lessthan a half mile from the fort, and turned it so as to face the otherway.Terry now saw Porter and arranged for an assault on the following day.The two commanders arranged their signals so that they could communicatewith each other from time to time as they might have occasion.  At daylight the fleet commenced its firing.  The time agreed upon for theassault was the middle of the afternoon, and Ames who commanded theassaulting column moved at 3.30.  Porter landed a force of sailors andmarines to move against the sea-front in co-operation with Ames'sassault.  They were under Commander Breese of the navy.  These sailorsand marines had worked their way up to within a couple of hundred yardsof the fort before the assault.  The signal was given and the assaultwas made; but the poor sailors and marines were repulsed and very badlyhandled by the enemy, losing 280 killed and wounded out of their number.Curtis's brigade charged successfully though met by a heavy fire, someof the men having to wade through the swamp up to their waists to reachthe fort.  Many were wounded, of course, and some killed; but they soonreached the palisades.  These they cut away, and pushed on through.  Theother troops then came up, Pennypacker's following Curtis, and Bell, whocommanded the 3d brigade of Ames's division, following Pennypacker.  Butthe fort was not yet captured though the parapet was gained.The works were very extensive.  The large parapet around the work wouldhave been but very little protection to those inside except when theywere close up under it.  Traverses had, therefore, been run until reallythe work was a succession of small forts enclosed by a large one.  Therebels made a desperate effort to hold the fort, and had to be drivenfrom these traverses one by one.  The fight continued till long afternight.  Our troops gained first one traverse and then another, and by 10o'clock at night the place was carried.  During this engagement thesailors, who had been repulsed in their assault on the bastion, renderedthe best service they could by reinforcing Terry's northern line--thusenabling him to send a detachment to the assistance of Ames.  The fleetkept up a continuous fire upon that part of the fort which was stilloccupied by the enemy.  By means of signals they could be informed whereto direct their shots.During the succeeding nights the enemy blew up Fort Caswell on theopposite side of Cape Fear River, and abandoned two extensive works onSmith's Island in the river.Our captures in all amounted to 169 guns, besides small-arms, with fullsupplies of ammunition, and 2,083 prisoners.  In addition to these,there were about 700 dead and wounded left there.  We had lost 110killed and 536 wounded.In this assault on Fort Fisher, Bell, one of the brigade commanders, waskilled, and two, Curtis and Pennypacker, were badly wounded.Secretary Stanton, who was on his way back from Savannah, arrived offFort Fisher soon after it fell.  When he heard the good news he promotedall the officers of any considerable rank for their conspicuousgallantry.  Terry had been nominated for major-general, but had not beenconfirmed.  This confirmed him; and soon after I recommended him for abrigadier-generalcy in the regular army, and it was given to him forthis victory.
ISFP	 LXII.SHERMAN'S MARCH NORTH--SHERIDAN ORDERED TO LYNCHBURG--CANBY ORDERED TOMOVE AGAINST MOBILE--MOVEMENTS OF SCHOFIELD AND THOMAS--CAPTURE OFCOLUMBIA, SOUTH CAROLINA--SHERMAN IN THE CAROLINAS.When news of Sherman being in possession of Savannah reached the North,distinguished statesmen and visitors began to pour in to see him.  Amongothers who went was the Secretary of War, who seemed much pleased at theresult of his campaign.  Mr. Draper, the collector of customs of NewYork, who was with Mr. Stanton's party, was put in charge of the publicproperty that had been abandoned and captured.  Savannah was then turnedover to General Foster's command to hold, so that Sherman might have hisown entire army free to operate as might be decided upon in the future.I sent the chief engineer of the Army of the Potomac (General Barnard)with letters to General Sherman.  He remained some time with thegeneral, and when he returned brought back letters, one of whichcontained suggestions from Sherman as to what ought to be done inco-operation with him, when he should have started upon his marchnorthward.I must not neglect to state here the fact that I had no idea originallyof having Sherman march from Savannah to Richmond, or even to NorthCarolina.  The season was bad, the roads impassable for anything exceptsuch an army as he had, and I should not have thought of ordering such amove.  I had, therefore, made preparations to collect transports tocarry Sherman and his army around to the James River by water, and soinformed him.  On receiving this letter he went to work immediately toprepare for the move, but seeing that it would require a long time tocollect the transports, he suggested the idea then of marching up norththrough the Carolinas.  I was only too happy to approve this; for ifsuccessful, it promised every advantage.  His march through Georgia hadthoroughly destroyed all lines of transportation in that State, and hadcompletely cut the enemy off from all sources of supply to the west ofit.  If North and South Carolina were rendered helpless so far ascapacity for feeding Lee's army was concerned, the Confederate garrisonat Richmond would be reduced in territory, from which to draw supplies,to very narrow limits in the State of Virginia; and, although thatsection of the country was fertile, it was already well exhausted ofboth forage and food.  I approved Sherman's suggestion therefore atonce.The work of preparation was tedious, because supplies, to load thewagons for the march, had to be brought from a long distance.  Shermanwould now have to march through a country furnishing fewer provisionsthan that he had previously been operating in during his march to thesea.  Besides, he was confronting, or marching toward, a force of theenemy vastly superior to any his troops had encountered on theirprevious march; and the territory through which he had to pass had nowbecome of such vast importance to the very existence of the Confederatearmy, that the most desperate efforts were to be expected in order tosave it.Sherman, therefore, while collecting the necessary supplies to startwith, made arrangements with Admiral Dahlgren, who commanded that partof the navy on the South Carolina and Georgia coast, and General Foster,commanding the troops, to take positions, and hold a few points on thesea coast, which he (Sherman) designated, in the neighborhood ofCharleston.This provision was made to enable him to fall back upon the sea coast,in case he should encounter a force sufficient to stop his onwardprogress.  He also wrote me a letter, making suggestions as to what hewould like to have done in support of his movement farther north.  Thisletter was brought to City Point by General Barnard at a time when Ihappened to be going to Washington City, where I arrived on the 21st ofJanuary.  I cannot tell the provision I had already made to co-operatewith Sherman, in anticipation of his expected movement, better than bygiving my reply to this letter.HEADQUARTERS ARMIES OF THE UNITED STATES, WASHINGTON, D. C., Jan. 21,1865.MAJOR-GENERAL W. T. SHERMAN, Commanding Mill Div. of the Mississippi.GENERAL:--Your letters brought by General Barnard were received at CityPoint, and read with interest.  Not having them with me, however, Icannot say that in this I will be able to satisfy you on all points ofrecommendation.  As I arrived here at one P.M., and must leave at sixP.M., having in the meantime spent over three hours with the Secretaryand General Halleck, I must be brief.  Before your last request to haveThomas make a campaign into the heart of Alabama, I had orderedSchofield to Annapolis, Md., with his corps.  The advance (six thousand)will reach the seaboard by the 23d, the remainder following as rapidlyas railroad transportation can be procured from Cincinnati.  The corpsnumbers over twenty-one thousand men.  I was induced to do this becauseI did not believe Thomas could possibly be got off before spring.  Hispursuit of Hood indicated a sluggishness that satisfied me that he wouldnever do to conduct one of your campaigns.  The command of the advanceof the pursuit was left to subordinates, whilst Thomas followed farbehind.  When Hood had crossed the Tennessee, and those in pursuit hadreached it, Thomas had not much more than half crossed the State, fromwhence he returned to Nashville to take steamer for Eastport. He ispossessed of excellent judgment, great coolness and honesty, but he isnot good on a pursuit.  He also reported his troops fagged, and that itwas necessary to equip up.  This report and a determination to give theenemy no rest determined me to use his surplus troops elsewhere.Thomas is still left with a sufficient force surplus to go to Selmaunder an energetic leader.  He has been telegraphed to, to know whetherhe could go, and, if so, which of the several routes he would select.No reply is yet received.  Canby has been ordered to act offensivelyfrom the sea-coast to the interior, towards Montgomery and Selma.Thomas's forces will move from the north at an early day, or some of histroops will be sent to Canby.  Without further reinforcements Canby willhave a moving column of twenty thousand men.Fort Fisher, you are aware, has been captured.  We have a force there ofeight thousand effective.  At New Bern about half the number.  It isrumored, through deserters, that Wilmington also has fallen.  I aminclined to believe the rumor, because on the 17th we knew the enemywere blowing up their works about Fort Caswell, and that on the 18thTerry moved on Wilmington.If Wilmington is captured, Schofield will go there.  If not, he will besent to New Bern.  In either event, all the surplus forces at the twopoints will move to the interior toward Goldsboro' in co-operation withyour movements.  From either point, railroad communications can be runout, there being here abundance of rolling-stock suited to the gauge ofthose roads.There have been about sixteen thousand men sent from Lee's army south.Of these, you will have fourteen thousand against you, if Wilmington isnot held by the enemy, casualties at Fort Fisher having overtaken abouttwo thousand.All these troops are subject to your orders as you come in communicationwith them.  They will be so instructed.  From about Richmond I willwatch Lee closely, and if he detaches much more, or attempts toevacuate, will pitch in.  In the meantime, should you be brought to ahalt anywhere, I can send two corps of thirty thousand effective men toyour support, from the troops about Richmond.To resume:  Canby is ordered to operate to the interior from the Gulf.A. J. Smith may go from the north, but I think it doubtful.  A force oftwenty-eight or thirty thousand will co-operate with you from New Bernor Wilmington, or both.  You can call for reinforcements.This will be handed you by Captain Hudson, of my staff, who will returnwith any message you may have for me.  If there is anything I can do foryou in the way of having supplies on ship-board, at any point on thesea-coast, ready for you, let me know it.Yours truly, U. S. GRANT, Lieut.-General.I had written on the 18th of January to General Sherman, giving him thenews of the battle of Nashville.  He was much pleased at the result,although, like myself, he had been very much disappointed at Thomas forpermitting Hood to cross the Tennessee River and nearly the whole Stateof Tennessee, and come to Nashville to be attacked there.  He, however,as I had done, sent Thomas a warm congratulatory letter.On the 10th of January, 1865, the resolutions of thanks to Sherman andhis army passed by Congress were approved.Sherman, after the capture, at once had the debris cleared up,commencing the work by removing the piling and torpedoes from the river,and taking up all obstructions.  He had then intrenched the city, sothat it could be held by a small garrison.  By the middle of January allhis work was done, except the accumulation of supplies to commence hismovement with.He proposed to move in two columns, one from Savannah, going along bythe river of the same name, and the other by roads farther east,threatening Charleston.  He commenced the advance by moving his rightwing to Beaufort, South Carolina, then to Pocotaligo by water.  Thiscolumn, in moving north, threatened Charleston, and, indeed, it was notdetermined at first that they would have a force visit Charleston.South Carolina had done so much to prepare the public mind of the Southfor secession, and had been so active in precipitating the decision ofthe question before the South was fully prepared to meet it, that therewas, at that time, a feeling throughout the North and also largelyentertained by people of the South, that the State of South Carolina,and Charleston, the hot-bed of secession in particular, ought to have aheavy hand laid upon them.  In fact, nothing but the decisive resultsthat followed, deterred the radical portion of the people fromcondemning the movement, because Charleston had been left out.  To passinto the interior would, however, be to insure the evacuation of thecity, and its possession by the navy and Foster's troops.  It is sosituated between two formidable rivers that a small garrison could haveheld it against all odds as long as their supplies would hold out.Sherman therefore passed it by.By the first of February all preparations were completed for the finalmarch, Columbia, South Carolina, being the first objective;Fayetteville, North Carolina, the second; and Goldsboro, orneighborhood, the final one, unless something further should bedetermined upon.  The right wing went from Pocotaligo, and the left fromabout Hardeeville on the Savannah River, both columns taking a prettydirect route for Columbia.  The cavalry, however, were to threatenCharleston on the right, and Augusta on the left.On the 15th of January Fort Fisher had fallen, news of which Sherman hadreceived before starting out on his march.  We already had New Bern andhad soon Wilmington, whose fall followed that of Fort Fisher; as didother points on the sea coast, where the National troops were now inreadiness to co-operate with Sherman's advance when he had passedFayetteville.On the 18th of January I ordered Canby, in command at New Orleans, tomove against Mobile, Montgomery and Selma, Alabama, for the purpose ofdestroying roads, machine shops, etc.  On the 8th of February I orderedSheridan, who was in the Valley of Virginia, to push forward as soon asthe weather would permit and strike the canal west of Richmond at orabout Lynchburg; and on the 20th I made the order to go to Lynchburg assoon as the roads would permit, saying:  'As soon as it is possible totravel, I think you will have no difficulty about reaching Lynchburgwith a cavalry force alone.  From there you could destroy the railroadand canal in every direction, so as to be of no further use to therebellion. * * * This additional raid, with one starting from EastTennessee under Stoneman, numbering about four or five thousand cavalry;one from Eastport, Mississippi, ten thousand cavalry; Canby, from MobileBay, with about eighteen thousand mixed troops--these three latterpushing for Tuscaloosa, Selma and Montgomery; and Sherman with a largearmy eating out the vitals of South Carolina--is all that will be wantedto leave nothing for the rebellion to stand upon.  I would advise you toovercome great obstacles to accomplish this.  Charleston was evacuatedon Tuesday last.'On the 27th of February, more than a month after Canby had received hisorders, I again wrote to him, saying that I was extremely anxious tohear of his being in Alabama.  I notified him, also, that I had sentGrierson to take command of his cavalry, he being a very efficientofficer.  I further suggested that Forrest was probably in Mississippi,and if he was there, he would find him an officer of great courage andcapacity whom it would be difficult to get by.  I still further informedhim that Thomas had been ordered to start a cavalry force intoMississippi on the 20th of February, or as soon as possible thereafter.This force did not get off however.All these movements were designed to be in support of Sherman's march,the object being to keep the Confederate troops in the West from leavingthere.  But neither Canby nor Thomas could be got off in time.  I hadsome time before depleted Thomas's army to reinforce Canby, for thereason that Thomas had failed to start an expedition which he had beenordered to send out, and to have the troops where they might dosomething.  Canby seemed to be equally deliberate in all of hismovements.  I ordered him to go in person; but he prepared to send adetachment under another officer.  General Granger had got down to NewOrleans, in some way or other, and I wrote Canby that he must not puthim in command of troops.  In spite of this he asked the War Departmentto assign Granger to the command of a corps.Almost in despair of having adequate service rendered to the cause inthat quarter, I said to Canby:  'I am in receipt of a dispatch * * *informing me that you have made requisitions for a construction corpsand material to build seventy miles of railroad.  I have directed thatnone be sent.  Thomas's army has been depleted to send a force to youthat they might be where they could act in winter, and at least detainthe force the enemy had in the West.  If there had been any idea ofrepairing railroads, it could have been done much better from the North,where we already had the troops.  I expected your movements to beco-operative with Sherman's last.  This has now entirely failed.  Iwrote to you long ago, urging you to push promptly and to live upon thecountry, and destroy railroads, machine shops, etc., not to build them.Take Mobile and hold it, and push your forces to the interior--toMontgomery and to Selma. Destroy railroads, rolling stock, andeverything useful for carrying on war, and, when you have done this,take such positions as can be supplied by water.  By this means aloneyou can occupy positions from which the enemy's roads in the interiorcan be kept broken.'Most of these expeditions got off finally, but too late to render anyservice in the direction for which they were designed.The enemy, ready to intercept his advance, consisted of Hardee's troopsand Wheeler's cavalry, perhaps less than fifteen thousand men in all;but frantic efforts were being made in Richmond, as I was sure would bethe case, to retard Sherman's movements. Everything possible was beingdone to raise troops in the South.  Lee dispatched against Sherman thetroops which had been sent to relieve Fort Fisher, which, includingthose of the other defences of the harbor and its neighborhood,amounted, after deducting the two thousand killed, wounded and captured,to fourteen thousand men.  After Thomas's victory at Nashville whatremained, of Hood's army were gathered together and forwarded as rapidlyas possible to the east to co-operate with these forces; and, finally,General Joseph E. Johnston, one of the ablest commanders of the Souththough not in favor with the administration (or at least with Mr.Davis), was put in command of all the troops in North and SouthCarolina.Schofield arrived at Annapolis in the latter part of January, but beforesending his troops to North Carolina I went with him down the coast tosee the situation of affairs, as I could give fuller directions afterbeing on the ground than I could very well have given without.  We soonreturned, and the troops were sent by sea to Cape Fear River.  Both NewBern and Wilmington are connected with Raleigh by railroads which uniteat Goldsboro.  Schofield was to land troops at Smithville, near themouth of the Cape Fear River on the west side, and move up to secure theWilmington and Charlotteville Railroad.  This column took their pontoonbridges with them, to enable them to cross over to the island south ofthe city of Wilmington.  A large body was sent by the north side toco-operate with them.  They succeeded in taking the city on the 22d ofFebruary.  I took the precaution to provide for Sherman's army, in casehe should be forced to turn in toward the sea coast before reachingNorth Carolina, by forwarding supplies to every place where he wasliable to have to make such a deflection from his projected march.  Ialso sent railroad rolling stock, of which we had a great abundance, nowthat we were not operating the roads in Virginia.  The gauge of theNorth Carolina railroads being the same as the Virginia railroads hadbeen altered too; these cars and locomotives were ready for use therewithout any change.On the 31st of January I countermanded the orders given to Thomas tomove south to Alabama and Georgia.  (I had previously reduced his forceby sending a portion of it to Terry.)  I directed in lieu of thismovement, that he should send Stoneman through East Tennessee, and pushhim well down toward Columbia, South Carolina, in support of Sherman.Thomas did not get Stoneman off in time, but, on the contrary, when Ihad supposed he was on his march in support of Sherman I heard of hisbeing in Louisville, Kentucky.  I immediately changed the order, anddirected Thomas to send him toward Lynchburg.  Finally, however, on the12th of March, he did push down through the north-western end of SouthCarolina, creating some consternation.  I also ordered Thomas to sendthe 4th corps (Stanley's) to Bull Gap and to destroy no more roads eastof that.  I also directed him to concentrate supplies at Knoxville, witha view to a probable movement of his army through that way towardLynchburg.Goldsboro is four hundred and twenty-five miles from Savannah. Sherman'smarch was without much incident until he entered Columbia, on the 17thof February.  He was detained in his progress by having to repair andcorduroy the roads, and rebuild the bridges.  There was constantskirmishing and fighting between the cavalry of the two armies, but thisdid not retard the advance of the infantry.  Four days, also, were lostin making complete the destruction of the most important railroads southof Columbia; there was also some delay caused by the high water, and thedestruction of the bridges on the line of the road.  A formidable riverhad to be crossed near Columbia, and that in the face of a smallgarrison under General Wade Hampton.  There was but little delay,however, further than that caused by high water in the stream.  Hamptonleft as Sherman approached, and the city was found to be on fire.There has since been a great deal of acrimony displayed in discussionsof the question as to who set Columbia on fire. Sherman denies it on thepart of his troops, and Hampton denies it on the part of theConfederates.  One thing is certain:  as soon as our troops tookpossession, they at once proceeded to extinguish the flames to the bestof their ability with the limited means at hand.  In any case, theexample set by the Confederates in burning the village of Chambersburg,Pa., a town which was not garrisoned, would seem to make a defence ofthe act of firing the seat of government of the State most responsiblefor the conflict then raging, not imperative.The Confederate troops having vacated the city, the mayor tookpossession, and sallied forth to meet the commander of the Nationalforces for the purpose of surrendering the town, making terms for theprotection of property, etc.  Sherman paid no attention at all to theoverture, but pushed forward and took the town without making anyconditions whatever with its citizens.  He then, however, co-operatedwith the mayor in extinguishing the flames and providing for the peoplewho were rendered destitute by this destruction of their homes.  When heleft there he even gave the mayor five hundred head of cattle to bedistributed among the citizens, to tide them over until some arrangementcould be made for their future supplies.  He remained in Columbia untilthe roads, public buildings, workshops and everything that could beuseful to the enemy were destroyed.  While at Columbia, Sherman learnedfor the first time that what remained of Hood's army was confrontinghim, under the command of General Beauregard.Charleston was evacuated on the 18th of February, and Foster garrisonedthe place.  Wilmington was captured on the 22d. Columbia and Cherawfarther north, were regarded as so secure from invasion that the wealthypeople of Charleston and Augusta had sent much of their valuableproperty to these two points to be stored.  Among the goods sent therewere valuable carpets, tons of old Madeira, silverware, and furniture.I am afraid much of these goods fell into the hands of our troops.There was found at Columbia a large amount of powder, some artillery,small-arms and fixed ammunition.  These, of course were among thearticles destroyed.  While here, Sherman also learned of Johnston'srestoration to command.  The latter was given, as already stated, alltroops in North and South Carolina.  After the completion of thedestruction of public property about Columbia, Sherman proceeded on hismarch and reached Cheraw without any special opposition and withoutincident to relate. The railroads, of course, were thoroughly destroyedon the way.  Sherman remained a day or two at Cheraw; and, finally, onthe 6th of March crossed his troops over the Pedee and advanced straightfor Fayetteville.  Hardee and Hampton were there, and barely escaped.Sherman reached Fayetteville on the 11th of March.  He had dispatchedscouts from Cheraw with letters to General Terry, at Wilmington, askinghim to send a steamer with some supplies of bread, clothing and otherarticles which he enumerated.  The scouts got through successfully, anda boat was sent with the mail and such articles for which Sherman hadasked as were in store at Wilmington; unfortunately, however, thosestores did not contain clothing.Four days later, on the 15th, Sherman left Fayetteville for Goldsboro.The march, now, had to be made with great caution, for he wasapproaching Lee's army and nearing the country that still remained opento the enemy.  Besides, he was confronting all that he had had toconfront in his previous march up to that point, reinforced by thegarrisons along the road and by what remained of Hood's army.  Franticappeals were made to the people to come in voluntarily and swell theranks of our foe.  I presume, however, that Johnston did not have in allover 35,000 or 40,000 men.  The people had grown tired of the war, anddesertions from the Confederate army were much more numerous than thevoluntary accessions.There was some fighting at Averysboro on the 16th between Johnston'stroops and Sherman's, with some loss; and at Bentonville on the 19th and21st of March, but Johnston withdrew from the contest before the morningof the 22d.  Sherman's loss in these last engagements in killed,wounded, and missing, was about sixteen hundred.  Sherman's troops atlast reached Goldsboro on the 23d of the month and went into bivouac;and there his men were destined to have a long rest.  Schofield wasthere to meet him with the troops which had been sent to Wilmington.Sherman was no longer in danger.  He had Johnston confronting him; butwith an army much inferior to his own, both in numbers and morale.  Hehad Lee to the north of him with a force largely superior; but I washolding Lee with a still greater force, and had he made his escape andgotten down to reinforce Johnston, Sherman, with the reinforcements henow had from Schofield and Terry, would have been able to hold theConfederates at bay for an indefinite period.  He was near the sea-shorewith his back to it, and our navy occupied the harbors.  He had arailroad to both Wilmington and New Bern, and his flanks were thoroughlyprotected by streams, which intersect that part of the country anddeepen as they approach the sea.  Then, too, Sherman knew that if Leeshould escape me I would be on his heels, and he and Johnson togetherwould be crushed in one blow if they attempted to make a stand.  Withthe loss of their capital, it is doubtful whether Lee's army would haveamounted to much as an army when it reached North Carolina.  Johnston'sarmy was demoralized by constant defeat and would hardly have made anoffensive movement, even if they could have been induced to remain onduty.  The men of both Lee's and Johnston's armies were, like theirbrethren of the North, as brave as men can be; but no man is so bravethat he may not meet such defeats and disasters as to discourage him anddampen his ardor for any cause, no matter how just he deems it.
ISFP	 LXIII.ARRIVAL OF THE PEACE COMMISSIONERS--LINCOLN AND THE PEACE COMMISSIONERS--AN ANECDOTE OF LINCOLN--THE WINTER BEFORE PETERSBURG--SHERIDAN DESTROYSTHE RAILROAD--GORDON CARRIES THE PICKET LINE--PARKE RECAPTURES THE LINE--THE LINE OF BATTLE OF WHITE OAK ROAD.On the last of January, 1865, peace commissioners from the so-calledConfederate States presented themselves on our lines around Petersburg,and were immediately conducted to my headquarters at City Point.  Theyproved to be Alexander H. Stephens, Vice-President of the Confederacy,Judge Campbell, Assistant-Secretary of War, and R. M. T. Hunt, formerlyUnited States Senator and then a member of the Confederate Senate.It was about dark when they reached my headquarters, and I at onceconducted them to the steam Mary Martin, a Hudson River boat which wasvery comfortably fitted up for the use of passengers.  I at oncecommunicated by telegraph with Washington and informed the Secretary ofWar and the President of the arrival of these commissioners and thattheir object was to negotiate terms of peace between the United Statesand, as they termed it, the Confederate Government.  I was instructed toretain them at City Point, until the President, or some one whom hewould designate, should come to meet them.  They remained several daysas guests on board the boat.  I saw them quite frequently, though I haveno recollection of having had any conversation whatever with them on thesubject of their mission.  It was something I had nothing to do with,and I therefore did not wish to express any views on the subject.  Formy own part I never had admitted, and never was ready to admit, thatthey were the representatives of a GOVERNMENT.  There had been too greata waste of blood and treasure to concede anything of the kind.  As longas they remained there, however, our relations were pleasant and I foundthem all very agreeable gentlemen.  I directed the captain to furnishthem with the best the boat afforded, and to administer to their comfortin every way possible.  No guard was placed over them and no restrictionwas put upon their movements; nor was there any pledge asked that theywould not abuse the privileges extended to them.  They were permitted toleave the boat when they felt like it, and did so, coming up on the bankand visiting me at my headquarters.I had never met either of these gentlemen before the war, but knew themwell by reputation and through their public services, and I had been aparticular admirer of Mr. Stephens.  I had always supposed that he was avery small man, but when I saw him in the dusk of the evening I was verymuch surprised to find so large a man as he seemed to be.  When he gotdown on to the boat I found that he was wearing a coarse gray woollenovercoat, a manufacture that had been introduced into the South duringthe rebellion.  The cloth was thicker than anything of the kind I hadever seen, even in Canada.  The overcoat extended nearly to his feet,and was so large that it gave him the appearance of being anaverage-sized man.  He took this off when he reached the cabin of theboat, and I was struck with the apparent change in size, in the coat andout of it.After a few days, about the 2d of February, I received a dispatch fromWashington, directing me to send the commissioners to Hampton Roads tomeet the President and a member of the cabinet.  Mr. Lincoln met themthere and had an interview of short duration.  It was not a great whileafter they met that the President visited me at City Point.  He spoke ofhis having met the commissioners, and said he had told them that therewould be no use in entering into any negotiations unless they wouldrecognize, first:  that the Union as a whole must be forever preserved,and second:  that slavery must be abolished. If they were willing toconcede these two points, then he was ready to enter into negotiationsand was almost willing to hand them a blank sheet of paper with hissignature attached for them to fill in the terms upon which they werewilling to live with us in the Union and be one people.  He alwaysshowed a generous and kindly spirit toward the Southern people, and Inever heard him abuse an enemy.  Some of the cruel things said aboutPresident Lincoln, particularly in the North, used to pierce him to theheart; but never in my presence did he evince a revengeful dispositionand I saw a great deal of him at City Point, for he seemed glad to getaway from the cares and anxieties of the capital.Right here I might relate an anecdote of Mr. Lincoln.  It was on theoccasion of his visit to me just after he had talked with the peacecommissioners at Hampton Roads.  After a little conversation, he askedme if I had seen that overcoat of Stephens's.  I replied that I had.'Well,' said he, 'did you see him take it off?'  I said yes.  'Well,'said he, 'didn't you think it was the biggest shuck and the littlest earthat ever you did see?'  Long afterwards I told this story to theConfederate General J. B. Gordon, at the time a member of the Senate.He repeated it to Stephens, and, as I heard afterwards, Stephens laughedimmoderately at the simile of Mr. Lincoln.The rest of the winter, after the departure of the peace commissioners,passed off quietly and uneventfully, except for two or three littleincidents.  On one occasion during this period, while I was visitingWashington City for the purpose of conferring with the administration,the enemy's cavalry under General Wade Hampton, passing our extreme leftand then going to the south, got in east of us.  Before their presencewas known, they had driven off a large number of beef cattle that weregrazing in that section.  It was a fair capture, and they weresufficiently needed by the Confederates.  It was only retaliating forwhat we had done, sometimes for many weeks at a time, when out ofsupplies taking what the Confederate army otherwise would have gotten.As appears in this book, on one single occasion we captured fivethousand head of cattle which were crossing the Mississippi River nearPort Hudson on their way from Texas to supply the Confederate army inthe East.One of the most anxious periods of my experience during the rebellionwas the last few weeks before Petersburg.  I felt that the situation ofthe Confederate army was such that they would try to make an escape atthe earliest practicable moment, and I was afraid, every morning, that Iwould awake from my sleep to hear that Lee had gone, and that nothingwas left but a picket line.  He had his railroad by the way of Danvillesouth, and I was afraid that he was running off his men and all storesand ordnance except such as it would be necessary to carry with him forhis immediate defence.  I knew he could move much more lightly and morerapidly than I, and that, if he got the start, he would leave me behindso that we would have the same army to fight again farther south and thewar might be prolonged another year.I was led to this fear by the fact that I could not see how it waspossible for the Confederates to hold out much longer where they were.There is no doubt that Richmond would have been evacuated much soonerthan it was, if it had not been that it was the capital of the so-calledConfederacy, and the fact of evacuating the capital would, of course,have had a very demoralizing effect upon the Confederate army.  When itwas evacuated (as we shall see further on), the Confederacy at oncebegan to crumble and fade away.  Then, too, desertions were takingplace, not only among those who were with General Lee in theneighborhood of their capital, but throughout the whole Confederacy.  Iremember that in a conversation with me on one occasion long prior tothis, General Butler remarked that the Confederates would find greatdifficulty in getting more men for their army; possibly adding, though Iam not certain as to this, 'unless they should arm the slave.'The South, as we all knew, were conscripting every able-bodied manbetween the ages of eighteen and forty-five; and now they had passed alaw for the further conscription of boys from fourteen to eighteen,calling them the junior reserves, and men from forty-five to sixty to becalled the senior reserves.  The latter were to hold the necessarypoints not in immediate danger, and especially those in the rear.General Butler, in alluding to this conscription, remarked that theywere thus 'robbing both the cradle and the grave,' an expression which Iafterwards used in writing a letter to Mr. Washburn.It was my belief that while the enemy could get no more recruits theywere losing at least a regiment a day, taking it throughout the entirearmy, by desertions alone.  Then by casualties of war, sickness, andother natural causes, their losses were much heavier.  It was a merequestion of arithmetic to calculate how long they could hold out whilethat rate of depletion was going on.  Of course long before their armywould be thus reduced to nothing the army which we had in the fieldwould have been able to capture theirs.  Then too I knew from the greatnumber of desertions, that the men who had fought so bravely, sogallantly and so long for the cause which they believed in--and asearnestly, I take it, as our men believed in the cause for which theywere fighting--had lost hope and become despondent.  Many of them weremaking application to be sent North where they might get employmentuntil the war was over, when they could return to their Southern homes.For these and other reasons I was naturally very impatient for the timeto come when I could commence the spring campaign, which I thoroughlybelieved would close the war.There were two considerations I had to observe, however, and whichdetained me.  One was the fact that the winter had been one of heavyrains, and the roads were impassable for artillery and teams.  It wasnecessary to wait until they had dried sufficiently to enable us to movethe wagon trains and artillery necessary to the efficiency of an armyoperating in the enemy's country.  The other consideration was thatGeneral Sheridan with the cavalry of the Army of the Potomac wasoperating on the north side of the James River, having come down fromthe Shenandoah. It was necessary that I should have his cavalry with me,and I was therefore obliged to wait until he could join me south of theJames River.Let us now take account of what he was doing.On the 5th of March I had heard from Sheridan.  He had met Early betweenStaunton and Charlottesville and defeated him, capturing nearly hisentire command.  Early and some of his officers escaped by findingrefuge in the neighboring houses or in the woods.On the 12th I heard from him again.  He had turned east, to come toWhite House.  He could not go to Lynchburg as ordered, because the rainshad been so very heavy and the streams were so very much swollen.  Hehad a pontoon train with him, but it would not reach half way acrosssome of the streams, at their then stage of water, which he would haveto get over in going south as first ordered.I had supplies sent around to White House for him, and kept the depotthere open until he arrived.  We had intended to abandon it because theJames River had now become our base of supplies.Sheridan had about ten thousand cavalry with him, divided into twodivisions commanded respectively by Custer and Devin. General Merrittwas acting as chief of cavalry.  Sheridan moved very light, carryingonly four days' provisions with him, with a larger supply of coffee,salt and other small rations, and a very little else besides ammunition.They stopped at Charlottesville and commenced tearing up the railroadback toward Lynchburg.  He also sent a division along the James RiverCanal to destroy locks, culverts etc.  All mills and factories along thelines of march of his troops were destroyed also.Sheridan had in this way consumed so much time that his making a marchto White House was now somewhat hazardous.  He determined therefore tofight his way along the railroad and canal till he was as near toRichmond as it was possible to get, or until attacked.  He did this,destroying the canal as far as Goochland, and the railroad to a point asnear Richmond as he could get.  On the 10th he was at Columbia.  Negroeshad joined his column to the number of two thousand or more, and theyassisted considerably in the work of destroying the railroads and thecanal.  His cavalry was in as fine a condition as when he started,because he had been able to find plenty of forage. He had captured mostof Early's horses and picked up a good many others on the road.  When hereached Ashland he was assailed by the enemy in force.  He resistedtheir assault with part of his command, moved quickly across the Southand North Anna, going north, and reached White House safely on the 19th.The time for Sherman to move had to be fixed with reference to the timehe could get away from Goldsboro where he then was. Supplies had to begot up to him which would last him through a long march, as there wouldprobably not be much to be obtained in the country through which hewould pass.  I had to arrange, therefore, that he should start fromwhere he was, in the neighborhood of Goldsboro on the 18th of April, theearliest day at which he supposed he could be ready.Sherman was anxious that I should wait where I was until he could comeup, and make a sure thing of it; but I had determined to move as soon asthe roads and weather would admit of my doing so.  I had been tied downsomewhat in the matter of fixing any time at my pleasure for starting,until Sheridan, who was on his way from the Shenandoah Valley to joinme, should arrive, as both his presence and that of his cavalry werenecessary to the execution of the plans which I had in mind.  However,having arrived at White House on the 19th of March, I was enabled tomake my plans.Prompted by my anxiety lest Lee should get away some night before I wasaware of it, and having the lead of me, push into North Carolina to joinwith Johnston in attempting to crush out Sherman, I had, as early as the1st of the month of March, given instructions to the troops aroundPetersburg to keep a sharp lookout to see that such a movement shouldnot escape their notice, and to be ready strike at once if it wasundertaken.It is now known that early in the month of March Mr. Davis and GeneralLee had a consultation about the situation of affairs in and about andPetersburg, and they both agreed places were no longer tenable for them,and that they must get away as soon as possible.  They, too, werewaiting for dry roads, or a condition of the roads which would make itpossible to move.General Lee, in aid of his plan of escape, and to secure a wider openingto enable them to reach the Danville Road with greater security than hewould have in the way the two armies were situated, determined upon anassault upon the right of our lines around Petersburg.  The night of the24th of March was fixed upon for this assault, and General Gordon wasassigned to the execution of the plan.  The point between Fort Stedmanand Battery No. 10, where our lines were closest together, was selectedas the point of his attack.  The attack was to be made at night, and thetroops were to get possession of the higher ground in the rear wherethey supposed we had intrenchments, then sweep to the right and left,create a panic in the lines of our army, and force me to contract mylines.  Lee hoped this would detain me a few days longer and give him anopportunity of escape.  The plan was well conceived and the execution ofit very well done indeed, up to the point of carrying a portion of ourline.Gordon assembled his troops under the cover of night, at the point atwhich they were to make their charge, and got possession of ourpicket-line, entirely without the knowledge of the troops inside of ourmain line of intrenchments; this reduced the distance he would have tocharge over to not much more than fifty yards.  For some time before thedeserters had been coming in with great frequency, often bringing theirarms with them, and this the Confederate general knew.  Taking advantageof this knowledge he sent his pickets, with their arms, creeping throughto ours as if to desert.  When they got to our lines they at once tookpossession and sent our pickets to the rear as prisoners. In the mainline our men were sleeping serenely, as if in great security.  This planwas to have been executed and much damage done before daylight; but thetroops that were to reinforce Gordon had to be brought from the northside of the James River and, by some accident on the railroad on theirway over, they were detained for a considerable time; so that it got tobe nearly daylight before they were ready to make the charge.The charge, however, was successful and almost without loss, the enemypassing through our lines between Fort Stedman and Battery No. 10.  Thenturning to the right and left they captured the fort and the battery,with all the arms and troops in them. Continuing the charge, they alsocarried batteries Eleven and Twelve to our left, which they turnedtoward City Point.Meade happened to be at City Point that night, and this break in hisline cut him off from all communication with his headquarters.  Parke,however, commanding the 9th corps when this breach took place,telegraphed the facts to Meade's headquarters, and learning that thegeneral was away, assumed command himself and with commendablepromptitude made all preparations to drive the enemy back.  GeneralTidball gathered a large number of pieces of artillery and planted themin rear of the captured works so as to sweep the narrow space of groundbetween the lines very thoroughly.  Hartranft was soon out with hisdivision, as also was Willcox.  Hartranft to the right of the breachheaded the rebels off in that direction and rapidly drove them back intoFort Stedman.  On the other side they were driven back into theintrenchments which they had captured, and batteries eleven and twelvewere retaken by Willcox early in the morning.Parke then threw a line around outside of the captured fort andbatteries, and communication was once more established.  The artilleryfire was kept up so continuously that it was impossible for theConfederates to retreat, and equally impossible for reinforcements tojoin them.  They all, therefore, fell captives into our hands.  Thiseffort of Lee's cost him about four thousand men, and resulted in theirkilling, wounding and capturing about two thousand of ours.After the recapture of the batteries taken by the Confederates, ourtroops made a charge and carried the enemy's intrenched picket line,which they strengthened and held.  This, in turn, gave us but a shortdistance to charge over when our attack came to be made a few dayslater.The day that Gordon was making dispositions for this attack (24th ofMarch) I issued my orders for the movement to commence on the 29th.Ord, with three divisions of infantry and Mackenzie's cavalry, was tomove in advance on the night of the 27th, from the north side of theJames River and take his place on our extreme left, thirty miles away.He left Weitzel with the rest of the Army of the James to hold BermudaHundred and the north of the James River.  The engineer brigade was tobe left at City Point, and Parke's corps in the lines about Petersburg.(*42)Ord was at his place promptly.  Humphreys and Warren were then on ourextreme left with the 2d and 5th corps.  They were directed on thearrival of Ord, and on his getting into position in their places, tocross Hatcher's Run and extend out west toward Five Forks, the objectbeing to get into a position from which we could strike the South SideRailroad and ultimately the Danville Railroad.  There was considerablefighting in taking up these new positions for the 2d and 5th corps, inwhich the Army of the James had also to participate somewhat, and thelosses were quite severe.This was what was known as the Battle of White Oak Road.
ISFP	 LXIV.INTERVIEW WITH SHERIDAN--GRAND MOVEMENT OF THE ARMY OF THE POTOMAC--SHERIDAN'S ADVANCE ON FIVE FORKS--BATTLE OF FIVE FORKS--PARKE ANDWRIGHT STORM THE ENEMY'S LINE--BATTLES BEFORE PETERSBURG.Sheridan reached City Point on the 26th day of March.  His horses, ofcourse, were jaded and many of them had lost their shoes.  A few days ofrest were necessary to recuperate the animals and also to have them shodand put in condition for moving.  Immediately on General Sheridan'sarrival at City Point I prepared his instructions for the move which Ihad decided upon.  The movement was to commence on the 29th of themonth.After reading the instructions I had given him, Sheridan walked out ofmy tent, and I followed to have some conversation with him by himself--not in the presence of anybody else, even of a member of my staff.  Inpreparing his instructions I contemplated just what took place; that isto say, capturing Five Forks, driving the enemy from Petersburg andRichmond and terminating the contest before separating from the enemy.But the Nation had already become restless and discouraged at theprolongation of the war, and many believed that it would never terminateexcept by compromise.  Knowing that unless my plan proved an entiresuccess it would be interpreted as a disastrous defeat, I provided inthese instructions that in a certain event he was to cut loose from theArmy of the Potomac and his base of supplies, and living upon thecountry proceed south by the way of the Danville Railroad, or near it,across the Roanoke, get in the rear of Johnston, who was guarding thatroad, and cooperate with Sherman in destroying Johnston; then with thesecombined forces to help carry out the instructions which Sherman alreadyhad received, to act in cooperation with the armies around Petersburgand Richmond.I saw that after Sheridan had read his instructions he seemed somewhatdisappointed at the idea, possibly, of having to cut loose again fromthe Army of the Potomac, and place himself between the two main armiesof the enemy.  I said to him: 'General, this portion of yourinstructions I have put in merely as a blind;' and gave him the reasonfor doing so, heretofore described.  I told him that, as a matter offact, I intended to close the war right here, with this movement, andthat he should go no farther.  His face at once brightened up, andslapping his hand on his leg he said:  'I am glad to hear it, and we cando it.'Sheridan was not however to make his movement against Five Forks untilhe got further instructions from me.One day, after the movement I am about to describe had commenced, andwhen his cavalry was on our extreme left and far to the rear, south,Sheridan rode up to where my headquarters were then established, atDabney's Mills.  He met some of my staff officers outside, and washighly jubilant over the prospects of success, giving reasons why hebelieved this would prove the final and successful effort.  Although mychief-of-staff had urged very strongly that we return to our positionabout City Point and in the lines around Petersburg, he asked Sheridanto come in to see me and say to me what he had been saying to them.Sheridan felt a little modest about giving his advice where it had notbeen asked; so one of my staff came in and told me that Sheridan hadwhat they considered important news, and suggested that I send for him.I did so, and was glad to see the spirit of confidence with which he wasimbued. Knowing as I did from experience, of what great value thatfeeling of confidence by a commander was, I determined to make amovement at once, although on account of the rains which had fallenafter I had started out the roads were still very heavy.  Orders weregiven accordingly.Finally the 29th of March came, and fortunately there having been a fewdays free from rain, the surface of the ground was dry, givingindications that the time had come when we could move.  On that date Imoved out with all the army available after leaving sufficient force tohold the line about Petersburg.  It soon set in raining again however,and in a very short time the roads became practically impassable forteams, and almost so for cavalry.  Sometimes a horse or mule would bestanding apparently on firm ground, when all at once one foot wouldsink, and as he commenced scrambling to catch himself all his feet wouldsink and he would have to be drawn by hand out of the quicksands socommon in that part of Virginia and other southern States.  It becamenecessary therefore to build corduroy roads every foot of the way as weadvanced, to move our artillery upon.  The army had become so accustomedto this kind of work, and were so well prepared for it, that it was donevery rapidly.  The next day, March 30th, we had made sufficient progressto the south-west to warrant me in starting Sheridan with his cavalryover by Dinwiddie with instructions to then come up by the road leadingnorth-west to Five Forks, thus menacing the right of Lee's line.This movement was made for the purpose of extending our lines to thewest as far as practicable towards the enemy's extreme right, or FiveForks.  The column moving detached from the army still in the trencheswas, excluding the cavalry, very small.  The forces in the trenches werethemselves extending to the left flank. Warren was on the extreme leftwhen the extension began, but Humphreys was marched around later andthrown into line between him and Five Forks.My hope was that Sheridan would be able to carry Five Forks, get on theenemy's right flank and rear, and force them to weaken their centre toprotect their right so that an assault in the centre might besuccessfully made.  General Wright's corps had been designated to makethis assault, which I intended to order as soon as information reachedme of Sheridan's success.  He was to move under cover as close to theenemy as he could get.It is natural to suppose that Lee would understand my design to be toget up to the South Side and ultimately to the Danville Railroad, assoon as he had heard of the movement commenced on the 29th.  These roadswere so important to his very existence while he remained in Richmondand Petersburg, and of such vital importance to him even in case ofretreat, that naturally he would make most strenuous efforts to defendthem.  He did on the 30th send Pickett with five brigades to reinforceFive Forks.  He also sent around to the right of his army some two orthree other divisions, besides directing that other troops be held inreadiness on the north side of the James River to come over on call.  Hecame over himself to superintend in person the defence of his rightflank.Sheridan moved back to Dinwiddie Court-House on the night of the 30th,and then took a road leading north-west to Five Forks.  He had only hiscavalry with him.  Soon encountering the rebel cavalry he met with avery stout resistance.  He gradually drove them back however until inthe neighborhood of Five Forks.  Here he had to encounter other troopsbesides those he had been contending with, and was forced to give way.In this condition of affairs he notified me of what had taken place andstated that he was falling back toward Dinwiddie gradually and slowly,and asked me to send Wright's corps to his assistance.  I replied to himthat it was impossible to send Wright's corps because that corps wasalready in line close up to the enemy, where we should want to assaultwhen the proper time came, and was besides a long distance from him; butthe 2d (Humphreys's) and 5th (Warren's) corps were on our extreme leftand a little to the rear of it in a position to threaten the left flankof the enemy at Five Forks, and that I would send Warren.Accordingly orders were sent to Warren to move at once that night (the31st) to Dinwiddie Court House and put himself in communication withSheridan as soon as possible, and report to him.  He was very slow inmoving, some of his troops not starting until after 5 o'clock nextmorning.  When he did move it was done very deliberately, and onarriving at Gravelly Run he found the stream swollen from the recentrains so that he regarded it as not fordable.  Sheridan of course knewof his coming, and being impatient to get the troops up as soon aspossible, sent orders to him to hasten.  He was also hastened or atleast ordered to move up rapidly by General Meade.  He now felt that hecould not cross that creek without bridges, and his orders were changedto move so as to strike the pursuing enemy in flank or get in theirrear; but he was so late in getting up that Sheridan determined to moveforward without him.  However, Ayres's division of Warren's corpsreached him in time to be in the fight all day, most of the timeseparated from the remainder of the 5th corps and fighting directlyunder Sheridan.Warren reported to Sheridan about 11 o'clock on the 1st, but the wholeof his troops were not up so as to be much engaged until late in theafternoon.  Griffin's division in backing to get out of the way of asevere cross fire of the enemy was found marching away from thefighting.  This did not continue long, however; the division was broughtback and with Ayres's division did most excellent service during theday.  Crawford's division of the same corps had backed still fartheroff, and although orders were sent repeatedly to bring it up, it waslate before it finally got to where it could be of material assistance.Once there it did very excellent service.Sheridan succeeded by the middle of the afternoon or a little later, inadvancing up to the point from which to make his designed assault uponFive Forks itself.  He was very impatient to make the assault and haveit all over before night, because the ground he occupied would beuntenable for him in bivouac during the night.  Unless the assault wasmade and was successful, he would be obliged to return to DinwiddieCourt-House, or even further than that for the night.It was at this junction of affairs that Sheridan wanted to getCrawford's division in hand, and he also wanted Warren.  He sent staffofficer after staff officer in search of Warren, directing that generalto report to him, but they were unable to find him.  At all eventsSheridan was unable to get that officer to him.  Finally he wenthimself.  He issued an order relieving Warren and assigning Griffin tothe command of the 5th corps. The troops were then brought up and theassault successfully made.I was so much dissatisfied with Warren's dilatory movements in thebattle of White Oak Road and in his failure to reach Sheridan in time,that I was very much afraid that at the last moment he would failSheridan.  He was a man of fine intelligence, great earnestness, quickperception, and could make his dispositions as quickly as any officer,under difficulties where he was forced to act.  But I had beforediscovered a defect which was beyond his control, that was veryprejudicial to his usefulness in emergencies like the one just beforeus.  He could see every danger at a glance before he had encountered it.He would not only make preparations to meet the danger which mightoccur, but he would inform his commanding officer what others should dowhile he was executing his move.I had sent a staff officer to General Sheridan to call his attention tothese defects, and to say that as much as I liked General Warren, nowwas not a time when we could let our personal feelings for any one standin the way of success; and if his removal was necessary to success, notto hesitate.  It was upon that authorization that Sheridan removedWarren.  I was very sorry that it had been done, and regretted stillmore that I had not long before taken occasion to assign him to anotherfield of duty.It was dusk when our troops under Sheridan went over the parapets of theenemy.  The two armies were mingled together there for a time in suchmanner that it was almost a question which one was going to demand thesurrender of the other.  Soon, however, the enemy broke and ran in everydirection; some six thousand prisoners, besides artillery and small-armsin large quantities, falling into our hands.  The flying troops werepursued in different directions, the cavalry and 5th corps underSheridan pursuing the larger body which moved north-west.This pursuit continued until about nine o'clock at night, when Sheridanhalted his troops, and knowing the importance to him of the part of theenemy's line which had been captured, returned, sending the 5th corpsacross Hatcher's Run to just south-west of Petersburg, and facing themtoward it.  Merritt, with the cavalry, stopped and bivouacked west ofFive Forks.This was the condition which affairs were in on the night of the 1st ofApril.  I then issued orders for an assault by Wright and Parke at fouro'clock on the morning of the 2d.  I also ordered the 2d corps, GeneralHumphreys, and General Ord with the Army of the James, on the left, tohold themselves in readiness to take any advantage that could be takenfrom weakening in their front.I notified Mr. Lincoln at City Point of the success of the day; in factI had reported to him during the day and evening as I got news, becausehe was so much interested in the movements taking place that I wanted torelieve his mind as much as I could.  I notified Weitzel on the northside of the James River, directing him, also, to keep close up to theenemy, and take advantage of the withdrawal of troops from there topromptly enter the city of Richmond.I was afraid that Lee would regard the possession of Five Forks as of somuch importance that he would make a last desperate effort to retake it,risking everything upon the cast of a single die.  It was for thisreason that I had ordered the assault to take place at once, as soon asI had received the news of the capture of Five Forks.  The corpscommanders, however, reported that it was so dark that the men could notsee to move, and it would be impossible to make the assault then. But wekept up a continuous artillery fire upon the enemy around the whole lineincluding that north of the James River, until it was light enough tomove, which was about a quarter to five in the morning.At that hour Parke's and Wright's corps moved out as directed, brushedthe abatis from their front as they advanced under a heavy fire ofmusketry and artillery, and went without flinching directly on till theymounted the parapets and threw themselves inside of the enemy's line.Parke, who was on the right, swept down to the right and captured a veryconsiderable length of line in that direction, but at that point theouter was so near the inner line which closely enveloped the city ofPetersburg that he could make no advance forward and, in fact, had avery serious task to turn the lines which he had captured to the defenceof his own troops and to hold them; but he succeeded in this.Wright swung around to his left and moved to Hatcher's Run, sweepingeverything before him.  The enemy had traverses in rear of his capturedline, under cover of which he made something of a stand, from one toanother, as Wright moved on; but the latter met no serious obstacle.  Asyou proceed to the left the outer line becomes gradually much fartherfrom the inner one, and along about Hatcher's Run they must be nearlytwo miles apart. Both Parke and Wright captured a considerable amount ofartillery and some prisoners--Wright about three thousand of them.In the meantime Ord and Humphreys, in obedience to the instructions theyhad received, had succeeded by daylight, or very early in the morning,in capturing the intrenched picket-lines in their front; and beforeWright got up to that point, Ord had also succeeded in getting inside ofthe enemy's intrenchments.  The second corps soon followed; and theouter works of Petersburg were in the hands of the National troops,never to be wrenched from them again.  When Wright reached Hatcher'sRun, he sent a regiment to destroy the South Side Railroad just outsideof the city.My headquarters were still at Dabney's saw-mills.  As soon as I receivedthe news of Wright's success, I sent dispatches announcing the fact toall points around the line, including the troops at Bermuda Hundred andthose on the north side of the James, and to the President at CityPoint.  Further dispatches kept coming in, and as they did I sent theadditional news to these points.  Finding at length that they were allin, I mounted my horse to join the troops who were inside the works.When I arrived there I rode my horse over the parapet just as Wright'sthree thousand prisoners were coming out.  I was soon joined inside byGeneral Meade and his staff.Lee made frantic efforts to recover at least part of the lost ground.Parke on our right was repeatedly assaulted, but repulsed every effort.Before noon Longstreet was ordered up from the north side of the JamesRiver thus bringing the bulk of Lee's army around to the support of hisextreme right.  As soon as I learned this I notified Weitzel anddirected him to keep up close to the enemy and to have Hartsuff,commanding the Bermuda Hundred front, to do the same thing, and if theyfound any break to go in; Hartsuff especially should do so, for thiswould separate Richmond and Petersburg.Sheridan, after he had returned to Five Forks, swept down to Petersburg,coming in on our left.  This gave us a continuous line from theAppomattox River below the city to the same river above.  At eleveno'clock, not having heard from Sheridan, I reinforced Parke with twobrigades from City Point.  With this additional force he completed hiscaptured works for better defence, and built back from his right, so asto protect his flank.  He also carried in and made an abatis betweenhimself and the enemy.  Lee brought additional troops and artilleryagainst Parke even after this was done, and made several assaults withvery heavy losses.The enemy had in addition to their intrenched line close up toPetersburg, two enclosed works outside of it, Fort Gregg and FortWhitworth.  We thought it had now become necessary to carry them byassault.  About one o'clock in the day, Fort Gregg was assaulted byFoster's division of the 24th corps (Gibbon's), supported by twobrigades from Ord's command.  The battle was desperate and the Nationaltroops were repulsed several times; but it was finally carried, andimmediately the troops in Fort Whitworth evacuated the place.  The gunsof Fort Gregg were turned upon the retreating enemy, and the commandingofficer with some sixty of the men of Fort Whitworth surrendered.I had ordered Miles in the morning to report to Sheridan.  In moving toexecute this order he came upon the enemy at the intersection of theWhite Oak Road and the Claiborne Road.  The enemy fell back toSutherland Station on the South Side Road and were followed by Miles.This position, naturally a strong and defensible one, was also stronglyintrenched.  Sheridan now came up and Miles asked permission from him tomake the assault, which Sheridan gave.  By this time Humphreys had gotthrough the outer works in his front, and came up also and assumedcommand over Miles, who commanded a division in his corps.  I had sentan order to Humphreys to turn to his right and move towards Petersburg.This order he now got, and started off, thus leaving Miles alone.  Thelatter made two assaults, both of which failed, and he had to fall backa few hundred yards.Hearing that Miles had been left in this position, I directed Humphreysto send a division back to his relief.  He went himself.Sheridan before starting to sweep down to Petersburg had sent Merrittwith his cavalry to the west to attack some Confederate cavalry that hadassembled there.  Merritt drove them north to the Appomattox River.Sheridan then took the enemy at Sutherland Station on the reverse sidefrom where Miles was, and the two together captured the place, with alarge number of prisoners and some pieces of artillery, and put theremainder, portions of three Confederate corps, to flight.  Sheridanfollowed, and drove them until night, when further pursuit was stopped.Miles bivouacked for the night on the ground which he with Sheridan hadcarried so handsomely by assault.  I cannot explain the situation herebetter than by giving my dispatch to City Point that evening:BOYDTON ROAD, NEAR PETERSBURG, April 2, 1865.--4.40 P.M.COLONEL T. S. BOWERS, City Point.We are now up and have a continuous line of troops, and in a few hourswill be intrenched from the Appomattox below Petersburg to the riverabove.  Heth's and Wilcox's divisions, such part of them as were notcaptured, were cut off from town, either designedly on their part orbecause they could not help it. Sheridan with the cavalry and 5th corpsis above them.  Miles's division, 2d corps, was sent from the White OakRoad to Sutherland Station on the South Side Railroad, where he metthem, and at last accounts was engaged with them.  Not knowing whetherSheridan would get up in time, General Humphreys was sent with anotherdivision from here.  The whole captures since the army started outgunning will amount to not less than twelve thousand men, and probablyfifty pieces of artillery.  I do not know the number of men and gunsaccurately however.  * * *  I think the President might come out and payus a visit tomorrow.U. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General.During the night of April 2d our line was intrenched from the riverabove to the river below.  I ordered a bombardment to be commenced thenext morning at five A.M., to be followed by an assault at six o'clock;but the enemy evacuated Petersburg early in the morning.
ISFP	 LXV.THE CAPTURE OF PETERSBURG--MEETING PRESIDENT LINCOLN IN PETERSBURG--THECAPTURE OF RICHMOND--PURSUING THE ENEMY--VISIT TO SHERIDAN AND MEADE.General Meade and I entered Petersburg on the morning of the 3d and tooka position under cover of a house which protected us from the enemy'smusketry which was flying thick and fast there.  As we wouldoccasionally look around the corner we could see the streets and theAppomattox bottom, presumably near the bridge, packed with theConfederate army.  I did not have artillery brought up, because I wassure Lee was trying to make his escape, and I wanted to push immediatelyin pursuit.  At all events I had not the heart to turn the artilleryupon such a mass of defeated and fleeing men, and I hoped to capturethem soon.Soon after the enemy had entirely evacuated Petersburg, a man came inwho represented himself to be an engineer of the Army of NorthernVirginia.  He said that Lee had for some time been at work preparing astrong enclosed intrenchment, into which he would throw himself whenforced out of Petersburg, and fight his final battle there; that he wasactually at that time drawing his troops from Richmond, and falling backinto this prepared work. This statement was made to General Meade andmyself when we were together.  I had already given orders for themovement up the south side of the Appomattox for the purpose of headingoff Lee; but Meade was so much impressed by this man's story that hethought we ought to cross the Appomattox there at once and move againstLee in his new position.  I knew that Lee was no fool, as he would havebeen to have put himself and his army between two formidable streamslike the James and Appomattox rivers, and between two such armies asthose of the Potomac and the James. Then these streams coming togetheras they did to the east of him, it would be only necessary to close upin the west to have him thoroughly cut off from all supplies orpossibility of reinforcement.  It would only have been a question ofdays, and not many of them, if he had taken the position assigned to himby the so-called engineer, when he would have been obliged to surrenderhis army.  Such is one of the ruses resorted to in war to deceive yourantagonist.  My judgment was that Lee would necessarily have to evacuateRichmond, and that the only course for him to pursue would be to followthe Danville Road. Accordingly my object was to secure a point on thatroad south of Lee, and I told Meade this.  He suggested that if Lee wasgoing that way we would follow him.  My reply was that we did not wantto follow him; we wanted to get ahead of him and cut him off, and if hewould only stay in the position he (Meade) believed him to be in at thattime, I wanted nothing better; that when we got in possession of theDanville Railroad, at its crossing of the Appomattox River, if we stillfound him between the two rivers, all we had to do was to move eastwardand close him up.  That we would then have all the advantage we couldpossibly have by moving directly against him from Petersburg, even if heremained in the position assigned him by the engineer officer.I had held most of the command aloof from the intrenchments, so as tostart them out on the Danville Road early in the morning, supposing thatLee would be gone during the night.  During the night I strengthenedSheridan by sending him Humphreys's corps.Lee, as we now know, had advised the authorities at Richmond, during theday, of the condition of affairs, and told them it would be impossiblefor him to hold out longer than night, if he could hold out that long.Davis was at church when he received Lee's dispatch.  The congregationwas dismissed with the notice that there would be no evening service.The rebel government left Richmond about two o'clock in the afternoon ofthe 2d.At night Lee ordered his troops to assemble at Amelia Court House, hisobject being to get away, join Johnston if possible, and to try to crushSherman before I could get there.  As soon as I was sure of this Inotified Sheridan and directed him to move out on the Danville Railroadto the south side of the Appomattox River as speedily as possible.  Hereplied that he already had some of his command nine miles out.  I thenordered the rest of the Army of the Potomac under Meade to follow thesame road in the morning.  Parke's corps followed by the same road, andthe Army of the James was directed to follow the road which ranalongside of the South Side Railroad to Burke's Station, and to repairthe railroad and telegraph as they proceeded.  That road was a 5 feetgauge, while our rolling stock was all of the 4 feet 8 1/2 inches gauge;consequently the rail on one side of the track had to be taken upthroughout the whole length and relaid so as to conform to the gauge ofour cars and locomotives.Mr. Lincoln was at City Point at the time, and had been for some days.I would have let him know what I contemplated doing, only while I felt astrong conviction that the move was going to be successful, yet it mightnot prove so; and then I would have only added another to the manydisappointments he had been suffering for the past three years.  Butwhen we started out he saw that we were moving for a purpose, andbidding us Godspeed, remained there to hear the result.The next morning after the capture of Petersburg, I telegraphed Mr.Lincoln asking him to ride out there and see me, while I would await hisarrival.  I had started all the troops out early in the morning, so thatafter the National army left Petersburg there was not a soul to be seen,not even an animal in the streets.  There was absolutely no one there,except my staff officers and, possibly, a small escort of cavalry.  Wehad selected the piazza of a deserted house, and occupied it until thePresident arrived.About the first thing that Mr. Lincoln said to me, after warmcongratulations for the victory, and thanks both to myself and to thearmy which had accomplished it, was:  'Do you know, general, that I havehad a sort of a sneaking idea for some days that you intended to dosomething like this.'  Our movements having been successful up to thispoint, I no longer had any object in concealing from the President allmy movements, and the objects I had in view.  He remained for some daysnear City Point, and I communicated with him frequently and fully bytelegraph.Mr. Lincoln knew that it had been arranged for Sherman to join me at afixed time, to co-operate in the destruction of Lee's army.  I told himthat I had been very anxious to have the Eastern armies vanquish theirold enemy who had so long resisted all their repeated and gallantattempts to subdue them or drive them from their capital.  The Westernarmies had been in the main successful until they had conquered all theterritory from the Mississippi River to the State of North Carolina, andwere now almost ready to knock at the back door of Richmond, askingadmittance.  I said to him that if the Western armies should be evenupon the field, operating against Richmond and Lee, the credit would begiven to them for the capture, by politicians and non-combatants fromthe section of country which those troops hailed from.  It might lead todisagreeable bickerings between members of Congress of the East andthose of the West in some of their debates.  Western members might bethrowing it up to the members of the East that in the suppression of therebellion they were not able to capture an army, or to accomplish muchin the way of contributing toward that end, but had to wait until theWestern armies had conquered all the territory south and west of them,and then come on to help them capture the only army they had beenengaged with.Mr. Lincoln said he saw that now, but had never thought of it before,because his anxiety was so great that he did not care where the aid camefrom so the work was done.The Army of the Potomac has every reason to be proud of its four years'record in the suppression of the rebellion.  The army it had to fightwas the protection to the capital of a people which was attempting tofound a nation upon the territory of the United States.  Its loss wouldbe the loss of the cause.  Every energy, therefore, was put forth by theConfederacy to protect and maintain their capital.  Everything elsewould go if it went. Lee's army had to be strengthened to enable it tomaintain its position, no matter what territory was wrested from theSouth in another quarter.I never expected any such bickering as I have indicated, between thesoldiers of the two sections; and, fortunately, there has been nonebetween the politicians.  Possibly I am the only one who thought of theliability of such a state of things in advance.When our conversation was at an end Mr. Lincoln mounted his horse andstarted on his return to City Point, while I and my staff started tojoin the army, now a good many miles in advance.  Up to this time I hadnot received the report of the capture of Richmond.Soon after I left President Lincoln I received a dispatch from GeneralWeitzel which notified me that he had taken possession of Richmond atabout 8.15 o'clock in the morning of that day, the 3d, and that he hadfound the city on fire in two places. The city was in the most utterconfusion.  The authorities had taken the precaution to empty all theliquor into the gutter, and to throw out the provisions which theConfederate government had left, for the people to gather up.  The cityhad been deserted by the authorities, civil and military, without anynotice whatever that they were about to leave.  In fact, up to the veryhour of the evacuation the people had been led to believe that Lee hadgained an important victory somewhere around Petersburg.Weitzel's command found evidence of great demoralization in Lee's army,there being still a great many men and even officers in the town.  Thecity was on fire.  Our troops were directed to extinguish the flames,which they finally succeeded in doing. The fire had been started by someone connected with the retreating army.  All authorities deny that itwas authorized, and I presume it was the work of excited men who wereleaving what they regarded as their capital and may have felt that itwas better to destroy it than have it fall into the hands of theirenemy.  Be that as it may, the National troops found the city in flames,and used every effort to extinguish them.The troops that had formed Lee's right, a great many of them, were cutoff from getting back into Petersburg, and were pursued by our cavalryso hotly and closely that they threw away caissons, ammunition,clothing, and almost everything to lighten their loads, and pushed alongup the Appomattox River until finally they took water and crossed over.I left Mr. Lincoln and started, as I have already said, to join thecommand, which halted at Sutherland Station, about nine miles out.  Wehad still time to march as much farther, and time was an object; but theroads were bad and the trains belonging to the advance corps had blockedup the road so that it was impossible to get on.  Then, again, ourcavalry had struck some of the enemy and were pursuing them; and theorders were that the roads should be given up to the cavalry wheneverthey appeared.  This caused further delay.General Wright, who was in command of one of the corps which were leftback, thought to gain time by letting his men go into bivouac and tryingto get up some rations for them, and clearing out the road, so that whenthey did start they would be uninterrupted.  Humphreys, who was farahead, was also out of rations.  They did not succeed in getting them upthrough the night; but the Army of the Potomac, officers and men, wereso elated by the reflection that at last they were following up avictory to its end, that they preferred marching without rations torunning a possible risk of letting the enemy elude them.  So the marchwas resumed at three o'clock in the morning.Merritt's cavalry had struck the enemy at Deep Creek, and driven themnorth to the Appomattox, where, I presume, most of them were forced tocross.On the morning of the 4th I learned that Lee had ordered rations up fromDanville for his famishing army, and that they were to meet him atFarmville.  This showed that Lee had already abandoned the idea offollowing the railroad down to Danville, but had determined to gofarther west, by the way of Farmville.  I notified Sheridan of this anddirected him to get possession of the road before the supplies couldreach Lee.  He responded that he had already sent Crook's division toget upon the road between Burkesville and Jetersville, then to facenorth and march along the road upon the latter place; and he thoughtCrook must be there now.  The bulk of the army moved directly forJetersville by two roads.After I had received the dispatch from Sheridan saying that Crook was onthe Danville Road, I immediately ordered Meade to make a forced marchwith the Army of the Potomac, and to send Parke's corps across from theroad they were on to the South Side Railroad, to fall in the rear of theArmy of the James and to protect the railroad which that army wasrepairing as it went along.Our troops took possession of Jetersville and in the telegraph office,they found a dispatch from Lee, ordering two hundred thousand rationsfrom Danville.  The dispatch had not been sent, but Sheridan sent aspecial messenger with it to Burkesville and had it forwarded fromthere.  In the meantime, however, dispatches from other sources hadreached Danville, and they knew there that our army was on the line ofthe road; so that they sent no further supplies from that quarter.At this time Merritt and Mackenzie, with the cavalry, were off betweenthe road which the Army of the Potomac was marching on and theAppomattox River, and were attacking the enemy in flank.  They picked upa great many prisoners and forced the abandonment of some property.Lee intrenched himself at Amelia Court House, and also his advance northof Jetersville, and sent his troops out to collect forage.  The countrywas very poor and afforded but very little.  His foragers scattered agreat deal; many of them were picked up by our men, and many othersnever returned to the Army of Northern Virginia.Griffin's corps was intrenched across the railroad south of Jetersville,and Sheridan notified me of the situation.  I again ordered Meade upwith all dispatch, Sheridan having but the one corps of infantry with alittle cavalry confronting Lee's entire army.  Meade, always prompt inobeying orders, now pushed forward with great energy, although he washimself sick and hardly able to be out of bed.  Humphreys moved at two,and Wright at three o'clock in the morning, without rations, as I havesaid, the wagons being far in the rear.I stayed that night at Wilson's Station on the South Side Railroad.  Onthe morning of the 5th I sent word to Sheridan of the progress Meade wasmaking, and suggested that he might now attack Lee.  We had now no otherobjective than the Confederate armies, and I was anxious to close thething up at once.On the 5th I marched again with Ord's command until within about tenmiles of Burkesville, where I stopped to let his army pass. I thenreceived from Sheridan the following dispatch:'The whole of Lee's army is at or near Amelia Court House, and on thisside of it.  General Davies, whom I sent out to Painesville on theirright flank, has just captured six pieces of artillery and some wagons.We can capture the Army of Northern Virginia if force enough can bethrown to this point, and then advance upon it.  My cavalry was atBurkesville yesterday, and six miles beyond, on the Danville Road, lastnight.  General Lee is at Amelia Court House in person.  They are out ofrations, or nearly so.  They were advancing up the railroad towardsBurkesville yesterday, when we intercepted them at this point.'It now became a life and death struggle with Lee to get south to hisprovisions.Sheridan, thinking the enemy might turn off immediately towardsFarmville, moved Davies's brigade of cavalry out to watch him. Daviesfound the movement had already commenced.  He attacked and drove awaytheir cavalry which was escorting wagons to the west, capturing andburning 180 wagons.  He also captured five pieces of artillery.  TheConfederate infantry then moved against him and probably would havehandled him very roughly, but Sheridan had sent two more brigades ofcavalry to follow Davies, and they came to his relief in time.  A sharpengagement took place between these three brigades of cavalry and theenemy's infantry, but the latter was repulsed.Meade himself reached Jetersville about two o'clock in the afternoon,but in advance of all his troops.  The head of Humphreys's corpsfollowed in about an hour afterwards. Sheridan stationed the troops asthey came up, at Meade's request, the latter still being very sick.  Heextended two divisions of this corps off to the west of the road to theleft of Griffin's corps, and one division to the right.  The cavalry bythis time had also come up, and they were put still farther off to theleft, Sheridan feeling certain that there lay the route by which theenemy intended to escape.  He wanted to attack, feeling that if time wasgiven, the enemy would get away; but Meade prevented this, preferring towait till his troops were all up.At this juncture Sheridan sent me a letter which had been handed to himby a colored man, with a note from himself saying that he wished I wasthere myself.  The letter was dated Amelia Court House, April 5th, andsigned by Colonel Taylor.  It was to his mother, and showed thedemoralization of the Confederate army. Sheridan's note also gave me theinformation as here related of the movements of that day.  I received asecond message from Sheridan on the 5th, in which he urged moreemphatically the importance of my presence.  This was brought to me by ascout in gray uniform.  It was written on tissue paper, and wrapped upin tin-foil such as chewing tobacco is folded in.  This was a precautiontaken so that if the scout should be captured he could take thistin-foil out of his pocket and putting it into his mouth, chew it.  Itwould cause no surprise at all to see a Confederate soldier chewingtobacco. It was nearly night when this letter was received.  I gave Orddirections to continue his march to Burkesville and there intrenchhimself for the night, and in the morning to move west to cut off allthe roads between there and Farmville.I then started with a few of my staff and a very small escort ofcavalry, going directly through the woods, to join Meade's army.  Thedistance was about sixteen miles; but the night being dark our progresswas slow through the woods in the absence of direct roads.  However, wegot to the outposts about ten o'clock in the evening, and after somelittle parley convinced the sentinels of our identity and were conductedin to where Sheridan was bivouacked.  We talked over the situation forsome little time, Sheridan explaining to me what he thought Lee wastrying to do, and that Meade's orders, if carried out, moving to theright flank, would give him the coveted opportunity of escaping us andputting us in rear of him.We then together visited Meade, reaching his headquarters aboutmidnight.  I explained to Meade that we did not want to follow theenemy; we wanted to get ahead of him, and that his orders would allowthe enemy to escape, and besides that, I had no doubt that Lee wasmoving right then.  Meade changed his orders at once.  They were nowgiven for an advance on Amelia Court House, at an early hour in themorning, as the army then lay; that is, the infantry being across therailroad, most of it to the west of the road, with the cavalry swung outstill farther to the left.
ISFP	 LXVI.BATTLE OF SAILOR'S CREEK--ENGAGEMENT AT FARMVILLE--CORRESPONDENCE WITHGENERAL LEE--SHERIDAN INTERCEPTS THE ENEMY.The Appomattox, going westward, takes a long sweep to the south-westfrom the neighborhood of the Richmond and Danville Railroad bridge, andthen trends north-westerly.  Sailor's Creek, an insignificant stream,running northward, empties into the Appomattox between the High Bridgeand Jetersville.  Near the High Bridge the stage road from Petersburg toLynchburg crosses the Appomattox River, also on a bridge.  The railroadruns on the north side of the river to Farmville, a few miles west, andfrom there, recrossing, continues on the south side of it.  The roadscoming up from the south-east to Farmville cross the Appomattox Riverthere on a bridge and run on the north side, leaving the Lynchburg andPetersburg Railroad well to the left.Lee, in pushing out from Amelia Court House, availed himself of all theroads between the Danville Road and Appomattox River to move upon, andnever permitted the head of his columns to stop because of any fightingthat might be going on in his rear.  In this way he came very nearsucceeding in getting to his provision trains and eluding us with atleast part of his army.As expected, Lee's troops had moved during the night before, and ourarmy in moving upon Amelia Court House soon encountered them.  There wasa good deal of fighting before Sailor's Creek was reached.  Our cavalrycharged in upon a body of theirs which was escorting a wagon train inorder to get it past our left.  A severe engagement ensued, in which wecaptured many prisoners, and many men also were killed and wounded.There was as much gallantry displayed by some of the Confederates inthese little engagements as was displayed at any time during the war,notwithstanding the sad defeats of the past week.The armies finally met on Sailor's Creek, when a heavy engagement tookplace, in which infantry, artillery and cavalry were all brought intoaction.  Our men on the right, as they were brought in against theenemy, came in on higher ground, and upon his flank, giving us everyadvantage to be derived from the lay of the country.  Our firing wasalso very much more rapid, because the enemy commenced his retreatwestward and in firing as he retreated had to turn around every time hefired.  The enemy's loss was very heavy, as well in killed and woundedas in captures.  Some six general officers fell into our hands in thisengagement, and seven thousand men were made prisoners.  This engagementwas commenced in the middle of the afternoon of the 6th, and the retreatand pursuit were continued until nightfall, when the armies bivouackedupon the ground where the night had overtaken them.When the move towards Amelia Court House had commenced that morning, Iordered Wright's corps, which was on the extreme right, to be moved tothe left past the whole army, to take the place of Griffin's, andordered the latter at the same time to move by and place itself on theright.  The object of this movement was to get the 6th corps, Wright's,next to the cavalry, with which they had formerly served so harmoniouslyand so efficiently in the valley of Virginia.The 6th corps now remained with the cavalry and under Sheridan's directcommand until after the surrender.Ord had been directed to take possession of all the roads southwardbetween Burkesville and the High Bridge.  On the morning of the 6th hesent Colonel Washburn with two infantry regiments with instructions todestroy High Bridge and to return rapidly to Burkesville Station; and heprepared himself to resist the enemy there.  Soon after Washburn hadstarted Ord became a little alarmed as to his safety and sent ColonelRead, of his staff, with about eighty cavalrymen, to overtake him andbring him back.  Very shortly after this he heard that the head of Lee'scolumn had got up to the road between him and where Washburn now was,and attempted to send reinforcements, but the reinforcements could notget through.  Read, however, had got through ahead of the enemy.  Herode on to Farmville and was on his way back again when he found hisreturn cut off, and Washburn confronting apparently the advance of Lee'sarmy.  Read drew his men up into line of battle, his force nowconsisting of less than six hundred men, infantry and cavalry, and rodealong their front, making a speech to his men to inspire them with thesame enthusiasm that he himself felt.  He then gave the order to charge.This little band made several charges, of course unsuccessful ones, butinflicted a loss upon the enemy more than equal to their own entirenumber.  Colonel Read fell mortally wounded, and then Washburn; and atthe close of the conflict nearly every officer of the command and mostof the rank and file had been either killed or wounded.  The remainderthen surrendered.  The Confederates took this to be only the advance ofa larger column which had headed them off, and so stopped to intrench;so that this gallant band of six hundred had checked the progress of astrong detachment of the Confederate army.This stoppage of Lee's column no doubt saved to us the trains following.Lee himself pushed on and crossed the wagon road bridge near the HighBridge, and attempted to destroy it.  He did set fire to it, but theflames had made but little headway when Humphreys came up with his corpsand drove away the rear-guard which had been left to protect it while itwas being burned up.  Humphreys forced his way across with some loss,and followed Lee to the intersection of the road crossing at Farmvillewith the one from Petersburg.  Here Lee held a position which was verystrong, naturally, besides being intrenched.  Humphreys was alone,confronting him all through the day, and in a very hazardous position.He put on a bold face, however, and assaulted with some loss, but wasnot assaulted in return.Our cavalry had gone farther south by the way of Prince Edward's CourtHouse, along with the 5th corps (Griffin's), Ord falling in betweenGriffin and the Appomattox.  Crook's division of cavalry and Wright'scorps pushed on west of Farmville.  When the cavalry reached Farmvillethey found that some of the Confederates were in ahead of them, and hadalready got their trains of provisions back to that point; but ourtroops were in time to prevent them from securing anything to eat,although they succeeded in again running the trains off, so that we didnot get them for some time.  These troops retreated to the north side ofthe Appomattox to join Lee, and succeeded in destroying the bridge afterthem.  Considerable fighting ensued there between Wright's corps and aportion of our cavalry and the Confederates, but finally the cavalryforded the stream and drove them away.  Wright built a foot-bridge forhis men to march over on and then marched out to the junction of theroads to relieve Humphreys, arriving there that night.  I had stoppedthe night before at Burkesville Junction.  Our troops were then prettymuch all out of the place, but we had a field hospital there, and Ord'scommand was extended from that point towards Farmville.Here I met Dr. Smith, a Virginian and an officer of the regular army,who told me that in a conversation with General Ewell, one of theprisoners and a relative of his, Ewell had said that when we had gotacross the James River he knew their cause was lost, and it was the dutyof their authorities to make the best terms they could while they stillhad a right to claim concessions. The authorities thought differently,however.  Now the cause was lost and they had no right to claimanything.  He said further, that for every man that was killed afterthis in the war somebody is responsible, and it would be but very littlebetter than murder.  He was not sure that Lee would consent to surrenderhis army without being able to consult with the President, but he hopedhe would.I rode in to Farmville on the 7th, arriving there early in the day.Sheridan and Ord were pushing through, away to the south.  Meade wasback towards the High Bridge, and Humphreys confronting Lee as beforestated.  After having gone into bivouac at Prince Edward's Court House,Sheridan learned that seven trains of provisions and forage were atAppomattox, and determined to start at once and capture them; and aforced march was necessary in order to get there before Lee's army couldsecure them.  He wrote me a note telling me this.  This fact, togetherwith the incident related the night before by Dr. Smith, gave me theidea of opening correspondence with General Lee on the subject of thesurrender of his army.  I therefore wrote to him on this day, asfollows:HEADQUARTERS ARMIES OF THE U. S., 5 P.M., April 7, 1865.GENERAL R. E. LEE Commanding C. S. A.The result of the last week must convince you of the hopelessness offurther resistance on the part of the Army of Northern Virginia in thisstruggle.  I feel that it is so, and regard it as my duty to shift frommyself the responsibility of any further effusion of blood, by asking ofyou the surrender of that portion of the Confederate States army knownas the Army of Northern Virginia.U. S. GRANT, Lieut.-General.Lee replied on the evening of the same day as follows:April 7, 1865.GENERAL:  I have received your note of this day.  Though notentertaining the opinion you express on the hopelessness of furtherresistance on the part of the Army of Northern Virginia, I reciprocateyour desire to avoid useless effusion of blood, and therefore beforeconsidering your proposition, ask the terms you will offer on conditionof its surrender.R. E. LEE, General.LIEUT.-GENERAL U. S. GRANT, Commanding Armies of the U. S.This was not satisfactory, but I regarded it as deserving another letterand wrote him as follows:April 8, 1865.GENERAL R. E. LEE, Commanding C. S. A.Your note of last evening in reply to mine of same date, asking thecondition on which I will accept the surrender of the Army of NorthernVirginia is just received.  In reply I would say that, peace being mygreat desire, there is but one condition I would insist upon, namely:that the men and officers surrendered shall be disqualified for takingup arms again against the Government of the United States until properlyexchanged.  I will meet you, or will designate officers to meet anyofficers you may name for the same purpose, at any point agreeable toyou, for the purpose of arranging definitely the terms upon which thesurrender of the Army of Northern Virginia will be received.U. S. GRANT, Lieut.-General.Lee's army was rapidly crumbling.  Many of his soldiers had enlistedfrom that part of the State where they now were, and were continuallydropping out of the ranks and going to their homes.  I know that Ioccupied a hotel almost destitute of furniture at Farmville, which hadprobably been used as a Confederate hospital.  The next morning when Icame out I found a Confederate colonel there, who reported to me andsaid that he was the proprietor of that house, and that he was a colonelof a regiment that had been raised in that neighborhood.  He said thatwhen he came along past home, he found that he was the only man of theregiment remaining with Lee's army, so he just dropped out, and nowwanted to surrender himself.  I told him to stay there and he would notbe molested.  That was one regiment which had been eliminated from Lee'sforce by this crumbling process.Although Sheridan had been marching all day, his troops moved withalacrity and without any straggling.  They began to see the end of whatthey had been fighting four years for.  Nothing seemed to fatigue them.They were ready to move without rations and travel without rest untilthe end.  Straggling had entirely ceased, and every man was now a rivalfor the front.  The infantry marched about as rapidly as the cavalrycould.Sheridan sent Custer with his division to move south of AppomattoxStation, which is about five miles south-west of the Court House, to getwest of the trains and destroy the roads to the rear.  They got therethe night of the 8th, and succeeded partially; but some of the train menhad just discovered the movement of our troops and succeeded in runningoff three of the trains.  The other four were held by Custer.The head of Lee's column came marching up there on the morning of the9th, not dreaming, I suppose, that there were any Union soldiers near.The Confederates were surprised to find our cavalry had possession ofthe trains.  However, they were desperate and at once assaulted, hopingto recover them.  In the melee that ensued they succeeded in burning oneof the trains, but not in getting anything from it.  Custer then orderedthe other trains run back on the road towards Farmville, and the fightcontinued.So far, only our cavalry and the advance of Lee's army were engaged.Soon, however, Lee's men were brought up from the rear, no doubtexpecting they had nothing to meet but our cavalry.  But our infantryhad pushed forward so rapidly that by the time the enemy got up theyfound Griffin's corps and the Army of the James confronting them.  Asharp engagement ensued, but Lee quickly set up a white flag.
ISFP	 LXVII.NEGOTIATIONS AT APPOMATTOX--INTERVIEW WITH LEE AT MCLEAN'S HOUSE--THETERMS OF SURRENDER--LEE'S SURRENDER--INTERVIEW WITH LEE AFTER THESURRENDER.On the 8th I had followed the Army of the Potomac in rear of Lee.  I wassuffering very severely with a sick headache, and stopped at a farmhouseon the road some distance in rear of the main body of the army.  I spentthe night in bathing my feet in hot water and mustard, and puttingmustard plasters on my wrists and the back part of my neck, hoping to becured by morning. During the night I received Lee's answer to my letterof the 8th, inviting an interview between the lines on the followingmorning. (*43)  But it was for a different purpose from that ofsurrendering his army, and I answered him as follows:HEADQUARTERS ARMIES OF THE U. S., April 9, 1865.GENERAL R. E. LEE, Commanding C. S. A.Your note of yesterday is received.  As I have no authority to treat onthe subject of peace, the meeting proposed for ten A.M. to-day couldlead to no good.  I will state, however, General, that I am equallyanxious for peace with yourself, and the whole North entertains the samefeeling.  The terms upon which peace can be had are well understood.  Bythe South laying down their arms they will hasten that most desirableevent, save thousands of human lives and hundreds of millions ofproperty not yet destroyed.  Sincerely hoping that all our difficultiesmay be settled without the loss of another life, I subscribe myself,etc.,U. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General.I proceeded at an early hour in the morning, still suffering with theheadache, to get to the head of the column.  I was not more than two orthree miles from Appomattox Court House at the time, but to go direct Iwould have to pass through Lee's army, or a portion of it.  I hadtherefore to move south in order to get upon a road coming up fromanother direction.When the white flag was put out by Lee, as already described, I was inthis way moving towards Appomattox Court House, and consequently couldnot be communicated with immediately, and be informed of what Lee haddone.  Lee, therefore, sent a flag to the rear to advise Meade and oneto the front to Sheridan, saying that he had sent a message to me forthe purpose of having a meeting to consult about the surrender of hisarmy, and asked for a suspension of hostilities until I could becommunicated with.  As they had heard nothing of this until the fightinghad got to be severe and all going against Lee, both of these commandershesitated very considerably about suspending hostilities at all.  Theywere afraid it was not in good faith, and we had the Army of NorthernVirginia where it could not escape except by some deception.  They,however, finally consented to a suspension of hostilities for two hoursto give an opportunity of communicating with me in that time, ifpossible.  It was found that, from the route I had taken, they wouldprobably not be able to communicate with me and get an answer backwithin the time fixed unless the messenger should pass through the rebellines.Lee, therefore, sent an escort with the officer bearing this messagethrough his lines to me.April 9, 1865.GENERAL:  I received your note of this morning on the picket-linewhither I had come to meet you and ascertain definitely what terms wereembraced in your proposal of yesterday with reference to the surrenderof this army.  I now request an interview in accordance with the offercontained in your letter of yesterday for that purpose.R. E. LEE, General.LIEUTENANT-GENERAL U. S. GRANT Commanding U. S. Armies.When the officer reached me I was still suffering with the sickheadache, but the instant I saw the contents of the note I was cured.  Iwrote the following note in reply and hastened on:April 9, 1865.GENERAL R. E. LEE, Commanding C. S. Armies.Your note of this date is but this moment (11.50 A.M.) received, inconsequence of my having passed from the Richmond and Lynchburg road tothe Farmville and Lynchburg road.  I am at this writing about four mileswest of Walker's Church and will push forward to the front for thepurpose of meeting you. Notice sent to me on this road where you wishthe interview to take place will meet me.U. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General.I was conducted at once to where Sheridan was located with his troopsdrawn up in line of battle facing the Confederate army near by.  Theywere very much excited, and expressed their view that this was all aruse employed to enable the Confederates to get away.  They said theybelieved that Johnston was marching up from North Carolina now, and Leewas moving to join him; and they would whip the rebels where they nowwere in five minutes if I would only let them go in.  But I had no doubtabout the good faith of Lee, and pretty soon was conducted to where hewas.  I found him at the house of a Mr. McLean, at Appomattox CourtHouse, with Colonel Marshall, one of his staff officers, awaiting myarrival.  The head of his column was occupying a hill, on a portion ofwhich was an apple orchard, beyond a little valley which separated itfrom that on the crest of which Sheridan's forces were drawn up in lineof battle to the south.Before stating what took place between General Lee and myself, I willgive all there is of the story of the famous apple tree.Wars produce many stories of fiction, some of which are told until theyare believed to be true.  The war of the rebellion was no exception tothis rule, and the story of the apple tree is one of those fictionsbased on a slight foundation of fact. As I have said, there was an appleorchard on the side of the hill occupied by the Confederate forces.Running diagonally up the hill was a wagon road, which, at one point,ran very near one of the trees, so that the wheels of vehicles had, onthat side, cut off the roots of this tree, leaving a little embankment.General Babcock, of my staff, reported to me that when he first metGeneral Lee he was sitting upon this embankment with his feet in theroad below and his back resting against the tree.  The story had noother foundation than that.  Like many other stories, it would be verygood if it was only true.I had known General Lee in the old army, and had served with him in theMexican War; but did not suppose, owing to the difference in our age andrank, that he would remember me, while I would more naturally rememberhim distinctly, because he was the chief of staff of General Scott inthe Mexican War.When I had left camp that morning I had not expected so soon the resultthat was then taking place, and consequently was in rough garb.  I waswithout a sword, as I usually was when on horseback on the field, andwore a soldier's blouse for a coat, with the shoulder straps of my rankto indicate to the army who I was. When I went into the house I foundGeneral Lee.  We greeted each other, and after shaking hands took ourseats.  I had my staff with me, a good portion of whom were in the roomduring the whole of the interview.What General Lee's feelings were I do not know.  As he was a man of muchdignity, with an impassible face, it was impossible to say whether hefelt inwardly glad that the end had finally come, or felt sad over theresult, and was too manly to show it. Whatever his feelings, they wereentirely concealed from my observation; but my own feelings, which hadbeen quite jubilant on the receipt of his letter, were sad anddepressed.  I felt like anything rather than rejoicing at the downfallof a foe who had fought so long and valiantly, and had suffered so muchfor a cause, though that cause was, I believe, one of the worst forwhich a people ever fought, and one for which there was the leastexcuse.  I do not question, however, the sincerity of the great mass ofthose who were opposed to us.General Lee was dressed in a full uniform which was entirely new, andwas wearing a sword of considerable value, very likely the sword whichhad been presented by the State of Virginia; at all events, it was anentirely different sword from the one that would ordinarily be worn inthe field.  In my rough traveling suit, the uniform of a private withthe straps of a lieutenant-general, I must have contrasted verystrangely with a man so handsomely dressed, six feet high and offaultless form. But this was not a matter that I thought of untilafterwards.We soon fell into a conversation about old army times.  He remarked thathe remembered me very well in the old army; and I told him that as amatter of course I remembered him perfectly, but from the difference inour rank and years (there being about sixteen years' difference in ourages), I had thought it very likely that I had not attracted hisattention sufficiently to be remembered by him after such a longinterval.  Our conversation grew so pleasant that I almost forgot theobject of our meeting.  After the conversation had run on in this stylefor some time, General Lee called my attention to the object of ourmeeting, and said that he had asked for this interview for the purposeof getting from me the terms I proposed to give his army.  I said that Imeant merely that his army should lay down their arms, not to take themup again during the continuance of the war unless duly and properlyexchanged.  He said that he had so understood my letter.Then we gradually fell off again into conversation about matters foreignto the subject which had brought us together.  This continued for somelittle time, when General Lee again interrupted the course of theconversation by suggesting that the terms I proposed to give his armyought to be written out. I called to General Parker, secretary on mystaff, for writing materials, and commenced writing out the followingterms:APPOMATTOX C. H., VA.,Ap 19th, 1865.GEN. R. E. LEE, Comd'g C. S. A.GEN:  In accordance with the substance of my letter to you of the 8thinst., I propose to receive the surrender of the Army of N. Va. on thefollowing terms, to wit:  Rolls of all the officers and men to be madein duplicate.  One copy to be given to an officer designated by me, theother to be retained by such officer or officers as you may designate.The officers to give their individual paroles not to take up armsagainst the Government of the United States until properly exchanged,and each company or regimental commander sign a like parole for the menof their commands.  The arms, artillery and public property to be parkedand stacked, and turned over to the officer appointed by me to receivethem.  This will not embrace the side-arms of the officers, nor theirprivate horses or baggage.  This done, each officer and man will beallowed to return to their homes, not to be disturbed by United Statesauthority so long as they observe their paroles and the laws in forcewhere they may reside.Very respectfully, U. S. GRANT, Lt. Gen.When I put my pen to the paper I did not know the first word that Ishould make use of in writing the terms.  I only knew what was in mymind, and I wished to express it clearly, so that there could be nomistaking it.  As I wrote on, the thought occurred to me that theofficers had their own private horses and effects, which were importantto them, but of no value to us; also that it would be an unnecessaryhumiliation to call upon them to deliver their side arms.No conversation, not one word, passed between General Lee and myself,either about private property, side arms, or kindred subjects.  Heappeared to have no objections to the terms first proposed; or if he hada point to make against them he wished to wait until they were inwriting to make it.  When he read over that part of the terms about sidearms, horses and private property of the officers, he remarked, withsome feeling, I thought, that this would have a happy effect upon hisarmy.Then, after a little further conversation, General Lee remarked to meagain that their army was organized a little differently from the armyof the United States (still maintaining by implication that we were twocountries); that in their army the cavalrymen and artillerists ownedtheir own horses; and he asked if he was to understand that the men whoso owned their horses were to be permitted to retain them.  I told himthat as the terms were written they would not; that only the officerswere permitted to take their private property.  He then, after readingover the terms a second time, remarked that that was clear.I then said to him that I thought this would be about the last battle ofthe war--I sincerely hoped so; and I said further I took it that most ofthe men in the ranks were small farmers. The whole country had been soraided by the two armies that it was doubtful whether they would be ableto put in a crop to carry themselves and their families through the nextwinter without the aid of the horses they were then riding.  The UnitedStates did not want them and I would, therefore, instruct the officers Ileft behind to receive the paroles of his troops to let every man of theConfederate army who claimed to own a horse or mule take the animal tohis home.  Lee remarked again that this would have a happy effect.He then sat down and wrote out the following letter:HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF NORTHERN VIRGINIA, April 9, 1865.GENERAL:--I received your letter of this date containing the terms ofthe surrender of the Army of Northern Virginia as proposed by you.  Asthey are substantially the same as those expressed in your letter of the8th inst., they are accepted.  I will proceed to designate the properofficers to carry the stipulations into effect.R. E. LEE, General. LIEUT.-GENERAL U. S. GRANT.While duplicates of the two letters were being made, the Union generalspresent were severally presented to General Lee.The much talked of surrendering of Lee's sword and my handing it back,this and much more that has been said about it is the purest romance.The word sword or side arms was not mentioned by either of us until Iwrote it in the terms.  There was no premeditation, and it did not occurto me until the moment I wrote it down.  If I had happened to omit it,and General Lee had called my attention to it, I should have put it inthe terms precisely as I acceded to the provision about the soldiersretaining their horses.General Lee, after all was completed and before taking his leave,remarked that his army was in a very bad condition for want of food, andthat they were without forage; that his men had been living for somedays on parched corn exclusively, and that he would have to ask me forrations and forage.  I told him 'certainly,' and asked for how many menhe wanted rations.  His answer was 'about twenty-five thousand;' and Iauthorized him to send his own commissary and quartermaster toAppomattox Station, two or three miles away, where he could have, out ofthe trains we had stopped, all the provisions wanted.  As for forage, wehad ourselves depended almost entirely upon the country for that.Generals Gibbon, Griffin and Merritt were designated by me to carry intoeffect the paroling of Lee's troops before they should start for theirhomes--General Lee leaving Generals Longstreet, Gordon and Pendleton forthem to confer with in order to facilitate this work.  Lee and I thenseparated as cordially as we had met, he returning to his own lines, andall went into bivouac for the night at Appomattox.Soon after Lee's departure I telegraphed to Washington as follows:HEADQUARTERS APPOMATTOX C. H., VA., April 9th, 1865, 4.30 P.M.HON. E. M. STANTON, Secretary of War, Washington.General Lee surrendered the Army of Northern Virginia this afternoon onterms proposed by myself.  The accompanying additional correspondencewill show the conditions fully.U. S. GRANT, Lieut.-General.When news of the surrender first reached our lines our men commencedfiring a salute of a hundred guns in honor of the victory.  I at oncesent word, however, to have it stopped.  The Confederates were now ourprisoners, and we did not want to exult over their downfall.I determined to return to Washington at once, with a view to putting astop to the purchase of supplies, and what I now deemed other uselessoutlay of money.  Before leaving, however, I thought I (*44) would liketo see General Lee again; so next morning I rode out beyond our linestowards his headquarters, preceded by a bugler and a staff-officercarrying a white flag.Lee soon mounted his horse, seeing who it was, and met me.  We had therebetween the lines, sitting on horseback, a very pleasant conversation ofover half an hour, in the course of which Lee said to me that the Southwas a big country and that we might have to march over it three or fourtimes before the war entirely ended, but that we would now be able to doit as they could no longer resist us.  He expressed it as his earnesthope, however, that we would not be called upon to cause more loss andsacrifice of life; but he could not foretell the result.  I thensuggested to General Lee that there was not a man in the Confederacywhose influence with the soldiery and the whole people was as great ashis, and that if he would now advise the surrender of all the armies Ihad no doubt his advice would be followed with alacrity.  But Lee said,that he could not do that without consulting the President first.  Iknew there was no use to urge him to do anything against his ideas ofwhat was right.I was accompanied by my staff and other officers, some of whom seemed tohave a great desire to go inside the Confederate lines.  They finallyasked permission of Lee to do so for the purpose of seeing some of theirold army friends, and the permission was granted.  They went over, had avery pleasant time with their old friends, and brought some of them backwith them when they returned.When Lee and I separated he went back to his lines and I returned to thehouse of Mr. McLean.  Here the officers of both armies came in greatnumbers, and seemed to enjoy the meeting as much as though they had beenfriends separated for a long time while fighting battles under the sameflag.  For the time being it looked very much as if all thought of thewar had escaped their minds.  After an hour pleasantly passed in thisway I set out on horseback, accompanied by my staff and a small escort,for Burkesville Junction, up to which point the railroad had by thistime been repaired.
ISFP	 LXVIII.MORALE OF THE TWO ARMIES--RELATIVE CONDITIONS OF THE NORTH AND SOUTH--PRESIDENT LINCOLN VISITS RICHMOND--ARRIVAL AT WASHINGTON--PRESIDENTLINCOLN'S ASSASSINATION--PRESIDENT JOHNSON'S POLICY.After the fall of Petersburg, and when the armies of the Potomac and theJames were in motion to head off Lee's army, the morale of the Nationaltroops had greatly improved.  There was no more straggling, no more rearguards.  The men who in former times had been falling back, were now, asI have already stated, striving to get to the front.  For the first timein four weary years they felt that they were now nearing the time whenthey could return to their homes with their country saved.  On the otherhand, the Confederates were more than correspondingly depressed.  Theirdespondency increased with each returning day, and especially after thebattle of Sailor's Creek.  They threw away their arms in constantlyincreasing numbers, dropping out of the ranks and betaking themselves tothe woods in the hope of reaching their homes.  I have already instancedthe case of the entire disintegration of a regiment whose colonel I metat Farmville.  As a result of these and other influences, when Leefinally surrendered at Appomattox, there were only 28,356 officers andmen left to be paroled, and many of these were without arms.  It wasprobably this latter fact which gave rise to the statement sometimesmade, North and South, that Lee surrendered a smaller number of men thanwhat the official figures show.  As a matter of official record, and inaddition to the number paroled as given above, we captured between March29th and the date of surrender 19,132 Confederates, to say nothing ofLee's other losses, killed, wounded and missing, during the series ofdesperate conflicts which marked his headlong and determined flight.The same record shows the number of cannon, including those atAppomattox, to have been 689 between the dates named.There has always been a great conflict of opinion as to the number oftroops engaged in every battle, or all important battles, fought betweenthe sections, the South magnifying the number of Union troops engagedand belittling their own. Northern writers have fallen, in manyinstances, into the same error.  I have often heard gentlemen, who werethoroughly loyal to the Union, speak of what a splendid fight the Southhad made and successfully continued for four years before yielding, withtheir twelve million of people against our twenty, and of the twelvefour being colored slaves, non-combatants.  I will add to theirargument.  We had many regiments of brave and loyal men who volunteeredunder great difficulty from the twelve million belonging to the South.But the South had rebelled against the National government.  It was notbound by any constitutional restrictions.  The whole South was amilitary camp.  The occupation of the colored people was to furnishsupplies for the army.  Conscription was resorted to early, and embracedevery male from the age of eighteen to forty-five, excluding only thosephysically unfit to serve in the field, and the necessary number ofcivil officers of State and intended National government.  The old andphysically disabled furnished a good portion of these.  The slaves, thenon-combatants, one-third of the whole, were required to work in thefield without regard to sex, and almost without regard to age.  Childrenfrom the age of eight years could and did handle the hoe; they were notmuch older when they began to hold the plough.  The four million ofcolored non-combatants were equal to more than three times their numberin the North, age for age and sex for sex, in supplying food from thesoil to support armies.  Women did not work in the fields in the North,and children attended school.The arts of peace were carried on in the North.  Towns and cities grewduring the war.  Inventions were made in all kinds of machinery toincrease the products of a day's labor in the shop, and in the field.In the South no opposition was allowed to the government which had beenset up and which would have become real and respected if the rebellionhad been successful.  No rear had to be protected.  All the troops inservice could be brought to the front to contest every inch of groundthreatened with invasion.  The press of the South, like the people whoremained at home, were loyal to the Southern cause.In the North, the country, the towns and the cities presented about thesame appearance they do in time of peace.  The furnace was in blast, theshops were filled with workmen, the fields were cultivated, not only tosupply the population of the North and the troops invading the South,but to ship abroad to pay a part of the expense of the war.  In theNorth the press was free up to the point of open treason.  The citizencould entertain his views and express them.  Troops were necessary inthe Northern States to prevent prisoners from the Southern army beingreleased by outside force, armed and set at large to destroy by fire ourNorthern cities.  Plans were formed by Northern and Southern citizens toburn our cities, to poison the water supplying them, to spread infectionby importing clothing from infected regions, to blow up our river andlake steamers--regardless of the destruction of innocent lives.  Thecopperhead disreputable portion of the press magnified rebel successes,and belittled those of the Union army.  It was, with a large following,an auxiliary to the Confederate army.  The North would have been muchstronger with a hundred thousand of these men in the Confederate ranksand the rest of their kind thoroughly subdued, as the Union sentimentwas in the South, than we were as the battle was fought.As I have said, the whole South was a military camp.  The coloredpeople, four million in number, were submissive, and worked in the fieldand took care of the families while the able-bodied white men were atthe front fighting for a cause destined to defeat.  The cause waspopular, and was enthusiastically supported by the young men.  Theconscription took all of them.  Before the war was over, furtherconscriptions took those between fourteen and eighteen years of age asjunior reserves, and those between forty-five and sixty as seniorreserves.  It would have been an offence, directly after the war, andperhaps it would be now, to ask any able-bodied man in the South, whowas between the ages of fourteen and sixty at any time during the war,whether he had been in the Confederate army.  He would assert that hehad, or account for his absence from the ranks.  Under suchcircumstances it is hard to conceive how the North showed such asuperiority of force in every battle fought.  I know they did not.During 1862 and '3, John H. Morgan, a partisan officer, of no militaryeducation, but possessed of courage and endurance, operated in the rearof the Army of the Ohio in Kentucky and Tennessee.  He had no base ofsupplies to protect, but was at home wherever he went.  The armyoperating against the South, on the contrary, had to protect its linesof communication with the North, from which all supplies had to come tothe front.  Every foot of road had to be guarded by troops stationed atconvenient distances apart.  These guards could not render assistancebeyond the points where stationed.  Morgan Was foot-loose and couldoperate where, his information--always correct--led him to believe hecould do the greatest damage.  During the time he was operating in thisway he killed, wounded and captured several times the number he ever hadunder his command at any one time.  He destroyed many millions ofproperty in addition. Places he did not attack had to be guarded as ifthreatened by him.  Forrest, an abler soldier, operated farther west,and held from the National front quite as many men as could be sparedfor offensive operations.  It is safe to say that more than half theNational army was engaged in guarding lines of supplies, or were onleave, sick in hospital or on detail which prevented their bearing arms.Then, again, large forces were employed where no Confederate armyconfronted them.  I deem it safe to say that there were no largeengagements where the National numbers compensated for the advantage ofposition and intrenchment occupied by the enemy.While I was in pursuit of General Lee, the President went to Richmond incompany with Admiral Porter, and on board his flagship.  He found thepeople of that city in great consternation.  The leading citizens amongthe people who had remained at home surrounded him, anxious thatsomething should be done to relieve them from suspense.  General Weitzelwas not then in the city, having taken offices in one of the neighboringvillages after his troops had succeeded in subduing the conflagrationwhich they had found in progress on entering the Confederate capital.The President sent for him, and, on his arrival, a short interview washad on board the vessel, Admiral Porter and a leading citizen ofVirginia being also present. After this interview the President wrote anorder in about these words, which I quote from memory:  'General Weitzelis authorized to permit the body calling itself the Legislature ofVirginia to meet for the purpose of recalling the Virginia troops fromthe Confederate armies.'Immediately some of the gentlemen composing that body wrote out a callfor a meeting and had it published in their papers.  This call, however,went very much further than Mr. Lincoln had contemplated, as he did notsay the 'Legislature of Virginia' but 'the body which called itself theLegislature of Virginia.' Mr. Stanton saw the call as published in theNorthern papers the very next issue and took the liberty ofcountermanding the order authorizing any meeting of the Legislature, orany other body, and this notwithstanding the fact that the President wasnearer the spot than he was.This was characteristic of Mr. Stanton.  He was a man who neverquestioned his own authority, and who always did in war time what hewanted to do.  He was an able constitutional lawyer and jurist; but theConstitution was not an impediment to him while the war lasted.  In thislatter particular I entirely agree with the view he evidently held.  TheConstitution was not framed with a view to any such rebellion as that of1861-5.  While it did not authorize rebellion it made no provisionagainst it.  Yet the right to resist or suppress rebellion is asinherent as the right of self-defence, and as natural as the right of anindividual to preserve his life when in jeopardy.  The Constitution wastherefore in abeyance for the time being, so far as it in any wayaffected the progress and termination of the war.Those in rebellion against the government of the United States were notrestricted by constitutional provisions, or any other, except the actsof their Congress, which was loyal and devoted to the cause for whichthe South was then fighting.  It would be a hard case when one-third ofa nation, united in rebellion against the national authority, isentirely untrammeled, that the other two-thirds, in their efforts tomaintain the Union intact, should be restrained by a Constitutionprepared by our ancestors for the express purpose of insuring thepermanency of the confederation of the States.After I left General Lee at Appomattox Station, I went with my staff anda few others directly to Burkesville Station on my way to Washington.The road from Burkesville back having been newly repaired and the groundbeing soft, the train got off the track frequently, and, as a result, itwas after midnight of the second day when I reached City Point.  As soonas possible I took a dispatch-boat thence to Washington City.While in Washington I was very busy for a time in preparing thenecessary orders for the new state of affairs; communicating with mydifferent commanders of separate departments, bodies of troops, etc.But by the 14th I was pretty well through with this work, so as to beable to visit my children, who were then in Burlington, New Jersey,attending school.  Mrs. Grant was with me in Washington at the time, andwe were invited by President and Mrs. Lincoln to accompany them to thetheatre on the evening of that day.  I replied to the President's verbalinvitation to the effect, that if we were in the city we would takegreat pleasure in accompanying them; but that I was very anxious to getaway and visit my children, and if I could get through my work duringthe day I should do so.  I did get through and started by the eveningtrain on the 14th, sending Mr. Lincoln word, of course, that I would notbe at the theatre.At that time the railroad to New York entered Philadelphia on BroadStreet; passengers were conveyed in ambulances to the Delaware River,and then ferried to Camden, at which point they took the cars again.When I reached the ferry, on the east side of the City of Philadelphia,I found people awaiting my arrival there; and also dispatches informingme of the assassination of the President and Mr. Seward, and of theprobable assassination of the Vice President, Mr. Johnson, andrequesting my immediate return.It would be impossible for me to describe the feeling that overcame meat the news of these assassinations, more especially the assassinationof the President.  I knew his goodness of heart, his generosity, hisyielding disposition, his desire to have everybody happy, and above allhis desire to see all the people of the United States enter again uponthe full privileges of citizenship with equality among all.  I knew alsothe feeling that Mr. Johnson had expressed in speeches and conversationagainst the Southern people, and I feared that his course towards themwould be such as to repel, and make them unwilling citizens; and if theybecame such they would remain so for a long while.  I felt thatreconstruction had been set back, no telling how far.I immediately arranged for getting a train to take me back to WashingtonCity; but Mrs. Grant was with me; it was after midnight and Burlingtonwas but an hour away.  Finding that I could accompany her to our houseand return about as soon as they would be ready to take me from thePhiladelphia station, I went up with her and returned immediately by thesame special train.  The joy that I had witnessed among the people inthe street and in public places in Washington when I left there, hadbeen turned to grief; the city was in reality a city of mourning.  Ihave stated what I believed then the effect of this would be, and myjudgment now is that I was right.  I believe the South would have beensaved from very much of the hardness of feeling that was engendered byMr. Johnson's course towards them during the first few months of hisadministration.  Be this as it may, Mr. Lincoln's assassination wasparticularly unfortunate for the entire nation.Mr. Johnson's course towards the South did engender bitterness offeeling.  His denunciations of treason and his ever-ready remark,'Treason is a crime and must be made odious,' was repeated to all thosemen of the South who came to him to get some assurances of safety sothat they might go to work at something with the feeling that what theyobtained would be secure to them.  He uttered his denunciations withgreat vehemence, and as they were accompanied with no assurances ofsafety, many Southerners were driven to a point almost beyond endurance.The President of the United States is, in a large degree, or ought tobe, a representative of the feeling, wishes and judgment of those overwhom he presides; and the Southerners who read the denunciations ofthemselves and their people must have come to the conclusion that heuttered the sentiments of the Northern people; whereas, as a matter offact, but for the assassination of Mr. Lincoln, I believe the greatmajority of the Northern people, and the soldiers unanimously, wouldhave been in favor of a speedy reconstruction on terms that would be theleast humiliating to the people who had rebelled against theirgovernment.  They believed, I have no doubt, as I did, that besidesbeing the mildest, it was also the wisest, policy.The people who had been in rebellion must necessarily come back into theUnion, and be incorporated as an integral part of the nation.  Naturallythe nearer they were placed to an equality with the people who had notrebelled, the more reconciled they would feel with their oldantagonists, and the better citizens they would be from the beginning.They surely would not make good citizens if they felt that they had ayoke around their necks.I do not believe that the majority of the Northern people at that timewere in favor of negro suffrage.  They supposed that it would naturallyfollow the freedom of the negro, but that there would be a time ofprobation, in which the ex-slaves could prepare themselves for theprivileges of citizenship before the full right would be conferred; butMr. Johnson, after a complete revolution of sentiment, seemed to regardthe South not only as an oppressed people, but as the people bestentitled to consideration of any of our citizens.  This was more thanthe people who had secured to us the perpetuation of the Union wereprepared for, and they became more radical in their views.  TheSoutherners had the most power in the executive branch, Mr. Johnsonhaving gone to their side; and with a compact South, and such sympathyand support as they could get from the North, they felt that they wouldbe able to control the nation at once, and already many of them acted asif they thought they were entitled to do so.Thus Mr. Johnson, fighting Congress on the one hand, and receiving thesupport of the South on the other, drove Congress, which wasoverwhelmingly republican, to the passing of first one measure and thenanother to restrict his power.  There being a solid South on one sidethat was in accord with the political party in the North which hadsympathized with the rebellion, it finally, in the judgment of Congressand of the majority of the legislatures of the States, became necessaryto enfranchise the negro, in all his ignorance.  In this work, I shallnot discuss the question of how far the policy of Congress in thisparticular proved a wise one.  It became an absolute necessity, however,because of the foolhardiness of the President and the blindness of theSouthern people to their own interest.  As to myself, while stronglyfavoring the course that would be the least humiliating to the peoplewho had been in rebellion, I gradually worked up to the point where,with the majority of the people, I favored immediate enfranchisement.
ISFP	 LXIX.SHERMAN AND JOHNSTON--JOHNSTON'S SURRENDER TO SHERMAN--CAPTURE OFMOBILE--WILSON'S EXPEDITION--CAPTURE OF JEFFERSON DAVIS--GENERALTHOMAS'S QUALITIES--ESTIMATE OF GENERAL CANBY.When I left Appomattox I ordered General Meade to proceed leisurely backto Burkesville Station with the Army of the Potomac and the Army of theJames, and to go into camp there until further orders from me.  GeneralJohnston, as has been stated before, was in North Carolina confrontingGeneral Sherman.  It could not be known positively, of course, whetherJohnston would surrender on the news of Lee's surrender, though Isupposed he would; and if he did not, Burkesville Station was thenatural point from which to move to attack him.  The army which I couldhave sent against him was superior to his, and that with which Shermanconfronted him was also superior; and between the two he wouldnecessarily have been crushed, or driven away.  With the loss of theircapital and the Army of Northern Virginia it was doubtful whetherJohnston's men would have the spirit to stand.  My belief was that hewould make no such attempt; but I adopted this course as a precautionagainst what might happen, however improbable.Simultaneously with my starting from City Point, I sent a messenger toNorth Carolina by boat with dispatches to General Sherman, informing himof the surrender of Lee and his army; also of the terms which I hadgiven him; and I authorized Sherman to give the same terms to Johnstonif the latter chose to accept them.  The country is familiar with theterms that Sherman agreed to CONDITIONALLY, because they embraced apolitical question as well as a military one and he would therefore haveto confer with the government before agreeing to them definitely.General Sherman had met Mr. Lincoln at City Point while visiting thereto confer with me about our final movement, and knew what Mr. Lincolnhad said to the peace commissioners when he met them at Hampton Roads,viz.:  that before he could enter into negotiations with them they wouldhave to agree to two points: one being that the Union should bepreserved, and the other that slavery should be abolished; and if theywere ready to concede these two points he was almost ready to sign hisname to a blank piece of paper and permit them to fill out the balanceof the terms upon which we would live together.  He had also seennotices in the newspapers of Mr. Lincoln's visit to Richmond, and hadread in the same papers that while there he had authorized the conveningof the Legislature of Virginia.Sherman thought, no doubt, in adding to the terms that I had made withgeneral Lee, that he was but carrying out the wishes of the President ofthe United States.  But seeing that he was going beyond his authority,he made it a point that the terms were only conditional.  They signedthem with this understanding, and agreed to a truce until the termscould be sent to Washington for approval; if approved by the properauthorities there, they would then be final; if not approved, then hewould give due notice, before resuming hostilities.  As the world knows,Sherman, from being one of the most popular generals of the land(Congress having even gone so far as to propose a bill providing for asecond lieutenant-general for the purpose of advancing him to thatgrade), was denounced by the President and Secretary of War in verybitter terms.  Some people went so far as to denounce him as a traitor--a most preposterous term to apply to a man who had rendered so muchservice as he had, even supposing he had made a mistake in granting suchterms as he did to Johnston and his army.  If Sherman had takenauthority to send Johnston with his army home, with their arms to be putin the arsenals of their own States, without submitting the question tothe authorities at Washington, the suspicions against him might havesome foundation.  But the feeling against Sherman died out very rapidly,and it was not many weeks before he was restored to the fullestconfidence of the American people.When, some days after my return to Washington, President Johnson and theSecretary of war received the terms which General Sherman had forwardedfor approval, a cabinet meeting was immediately called and I was sentfor.  There seemed to be the greatest consternation, lest Sherman wouldcommit the government to terms which they were not willing to accede toand which he had no right to grant.  A message went out directing thetroops in the South not to obey General Sherman.  I was ordered toproceed at once to North Carolina and take charge of matter theremyself. Of course I started without delay, and reached there as soon aspossible.  I repaired to Raleigh, where Sherman was, as quietly aspossible, hoping to see him without even his army learning of mypresence.When I arrived I went to Sherman's headquarters, and we were at oncecloseted together.  I showed him the instruction and orders under whichI visited him.  I told him that I wanted him to notify General Johnstonthat the terms which they had conditionally agreed upon had not beenapproved in Washington, and that he was authorized to offer the sameterms I had given General Lee.  I sent Sherman to do this himself.  Idid not wish the knowledge of my presence to be known to the armygenerally; so I left it to Sherman to negotiate the terms of thesurrender solely by himself, and without the enemy knowing that I wasanywhere near the field.  As soon as possible I started to get away, toleave Sherman quite free and untrammelled.At Goldsboro', on my way back, I met a mail, containing the lastnewspapers, and I found in them indications of great excitement in theNorth over the terms Sherman had given Johnston; and harsh orders thathad been promulgated by the President and Secretary of War.  I knew thatSherman must see these papers, and I fully realized what greatindignation they would cause him, though I do not think his feelingscould have been more excited than were my own.  But like the true andloyal soldier that he was, he carried out the instructions I had givenhim, obtained the surrender of Johnston's army, and settled down in hiscamp about Raleigh, to await final orders.There were still a few expeditions out in the South that could not becommunicated with, and had to be left to act according to the judgmentof their respective commanders.  With these it was impossible to tellhow the news of the surrender of Lee and Johnston, of which they musthave heard, might affect their judgment as to what was best to do.The three expeditions which I had tried so hard to get off from thecommands of Thomas and Canby did finally get off:  one under Canbyhimself, against Mobile, late in March; that under Stoneman from EastTennessee on the 20th; and the one under Wilson, starting from Eastport,Mississippi, on the 22d of March.  They were all eminently successful,but without any good result. Indeed much valuable property was destroyedand many lives lost at a time when we would have liked to spare them.The war was practically over before their victories were gained.  Theywere so late in commencing operations, that they did not hold any troopsaway that otherwise would have been operating against the armies whichwere gradually forcing the Confederate armies to a surrender.  The onlypossible good that we may have experienced from these raids was byStoneman's getting near Lynchburg about the time the armies of thePotomac and the James were closing in on Lee at Appomattox.Stoneman entered North Carolina and then pushed north to strike theVirginia and Tennessee Railroad.  He got upon that road, destroyed itsbridges at different places and rendered the road useless to the enemyup to within a few miles of Lynchburg.  His approach caused theevacuation of that city about the time we were at Appomattox, and wasthe cause of a commotion we heard of there.  He then pushed south, andwas operating in the rear of Johnston's army about the time thenegotiations were going on between Sherman and Johnston for the latter'ssurrender.  In this raid Stoneman captured and destroyed a large amountof stores, while fourteen guns and nearly two thousand prisoners werethe trophies of his success.Canby appeared before Mobile on the 27th of March.  The city of Mobilewas protected by two forts, besides other intrenchments--Spanish Fort,on the east side of the bay, and Fort Blakely, north of the city.  Theseforts were invested.  On the night of the 8th of April, the Nationaltroops having carried the enemy's works at one point, Spanish Fort wasevacuated; and on the 9th, the very day of Lee's surrender, Blakely wascarried by assault, with a considerable loss to us.  On the 11th thecity was evacuated.I had tried for more than two years to have an expedition sent againstMobile when its possession by us would have been of great advantage.  Itfinally cost lives to take it when its possession was of no importance,and when, if left alone, it would within a few days have fallen into ourhands without any bloodshed whatever.Wilson moved out with full 12,000 men, well equipped and well armed.  Hewas an energetic officer and accomplished his work rapidly.  Forrest wasin his front, but with neither his old-time army nor his old-timeprestige.  He now had principally conscripts.  His conscripts weregenerally old men and boys.  He had a few thousand regular cavalry left,but not enough to even retard materially the progress of Wilson'scavalry.  Selma fell on the 2d of April, with a large number ofprisoners and a large quantity of war material, machine shops, etc., tobe disposed of by the victors.  Tuscaloosa, Montgomery and West Pointfell in quick succession.  These were all important points to the enemyby reason of their railroad connections, as depots of supplies, andbecause of their manufactories of war material.  They were fortified orintrenched, and there was considerable fighting before they werecaptured.  Macon surrendered on the 21st of April.  Here news wasreceived of the negotiations for the surrender of Johnston's army.Wilson belonged to the military division commanded by Sherman, and ofcourse was bound by his terms.  This stopped all fighting.General Richard Taylor had now become the senior Confederate officerstill at liberty east of the Mississippi River, and on the 4th of May hesurrendered everything within the limits of this extensive command.General E. Kirby Smith surrendered the trans-Mississippi department onthe 26th of May, leaving no other Confederate army at liberty tocontinue the war.Wilson's raid resulted in the capture of the fugitive president of thedefunct confederacy before he got out of the country. This occurred atIrwinsville, Georgia, on the 11th of May.  For myself, and I believe Mr.Lincoln shared the feeling, I would have been very glad to have seen Mr.Davis succeed in escaping, but for one reason:  I feared that if notcaptured, he might get into the trans-Mississippi region and there setup a more contracted confederacy.  The young men now out of homes andout of employment might have rallied under his standard and protractedthe war yet another year.  The Northern people were tired of the war,they were tired of piling up a debt which would be a further mortgageupon their homes.Mr. Lincoln, I believe, wanted Mr. Davis to escape, because he did notwish to deal with the matter of his punishment.  He knew there would bepeople clamoring for the punishment of the ex-Confederate president, forhigh treason.  He thought blood enough had already been spilled to atonefor our wickedness as a nation.  At all events he did not wish to be thejudge to decide whether more should be shed or not.  But his own lifewas sacrificed at the hands of an assassin before the ex-president ofthe Confederacy was a prisoner in the hands of the government which hehad lent all his talent and all his energies to destroy.All things are said to be wisely directed, and for the best interest ofall concerned.  This reflection does not, however, abate in theslightest our sense of bereavement in the untimely loss of so good andgreat a man as Abraham Lincoln.He would have proven the best friend the South could have had, and savedmuch of the wrangling and bitterness of feeling brought out byreconstruction under a President who at first wished to revenge himselfupon Southern men of better social standing than himself, but who stillsought their recognition, and in a short time conceived the idea andadvanced the proposition to become their Moses to lead them triumphantlyout of all their difficulties.The story of the legislation enacted during the reconstruction period tostay the hands of the President is too fresh in the minds of the peopleto be told now.  Much of it, no doubt, was unconstitutional; but it washoped that the laws enacted would serve their purpose before thequestion of constitutionality could be submitted to the judiciary and adecision obtained. These laws did serve their purpose, and now remain 'adead letter' upon the statute books of the United States, no one takinginterest enough in them to give them a passing thought.Much was said at the time about the garb Mr. Davis was wearing when hewas captured.  I cannot settle this question from personal knowledge ofthe facts; but I have been under the belief, from information given tome by General Wilson shortly after the event, that when Mr. Davislearned that he was surrounded by our cavalry he was in his tent dressedin a gentleman's dressing gown.  Naturally enough, Mr. Davis wanted toescape, and would not reflect much how this should be accomplishedprovided it might be done successfully.  If captured, he would be noordinary prisoner.  He represented all there was of that hostility tothe government which had caused four years of the bloodiest war--and themost costly in other respects of which history makes any record.  Everyone supposed he would be tried for treason if captured, and that hewould be executed.  Had he succeeded in making his escape in anydisguise it would have been adjudged a good thing afterwards by hisadmirers.As my official letters on file in the War Department, as well as myremarks in this book, reflect upon General Thomas by dwelling somewhatupon his tardiness, it is due to myself, as well as to him, that I givemy estimate of him as a soldier.  The same remark will apply also in thecase of General Canby.  I had been at West Point with Thomas one year,and had known him later in the old army.  He was a man of commandingappearance, slow and deliberate in speech and action; sensible, honestand brave.  He possessed valuable soldierly qualities in an eminentdegree.  He gained the confidence of all who served under him, andalmost their love.  This implies a very valuable quality.  It is aquality which calls out the most efficient services of the troopsserving under the commander possessing it.Thomas's dispositions were deliberately made, and always good. He couldnot be driven from a point he was given to hold.  He was not as good,however, in pursuit as he was in action.  I do not believe that he couldever have conducted Sherman's army from Chattanooga to Atlanta againstthe defences and the commander guarding that line in 1864.  On the otherhand, if it had been given him to hold the line which Johnston tried tohold, neither that general nor Sherman, nor any other officer could havedone it better.Thomas was a valuable officer, who richly deserved, as he has received,the plaudits of his countrymen for the part he played in the greattragedy of 1861-5.General Canby was an officer of great merit.  He was naturally studious,and inclined to the law.  There have been in the army but very few, ifany, officers who took as much interest in reading and digesting everyact of Congress and every regulation for the government of the army ashe.  His knowledge gained in this way made him a most valuable staffofficer, a capacity in which almost all his army services were renderedup to the time of his being assigned to the Military Division of theGulf.  He was an exceedingly modest officer, though of great talent andlearning.  I presume his feelings when first called upon to command alarge army against a fortified city, were somewhat like my own whenmarching a regiment against General Thomas Harris in Missouri in 1861.Neither of us would have felt the slightest trepidation in going intobattle with some one else commanding.  Had Canby been in otherengagements afterwards, he would, I have no doubt, have advanced withoutany fear arising from a sense of the responsibility.  He was afterwardskilled in the lava beds of Southern Oregon, while in pursuit of thehostile Modoc Indians.  His character was as pure as his talent andlearning were great.  His services were valuable during the war, butprincipally as a bureau officer.  I have no idea that it was from choicethat his services were rendered in an office, but because of hissuperior efficiency there.
ISFP	 LXX.THE END OF THE WAR--THE MARCH TO WASHINGTON--ONE OF LINCOLN'S ANECDOTES--GRAND REVIEW AT WASHINGTON--CHARACTERISTICS OF LINCOLN AND STANTON--ESTIMATE OF THE DIFFERENT CORPS COMMANDERS.Things began to quiet down, and as the certainty that there would be nomore armed resistance became clearer, the troops in North Carolina andVirginia were ordered to march immediately to the capital, and go intocamp there until mustered out.  Suitable garrisons were left at theprominent places throughout the South to insure obedience to the lawsthat might be enacted for the government of the several States, and toinsure security to the lives and property of all classes.  I do not knowhow far this was necessary, but I deemed it necessary, at that time,that such a course should be pursued.  I think now that these garrisonswere continued after they ceased to be absolutely required; but it isnot to be expected that such a rebellion as was fought between thesections from 1861 to 1865 could terminate without leaving many seriousapprehensions in the mind of the people as to what should be done.Sherman marched his troops from Goldsboro, up to Manchester, on thesouth side of the James River, opposite Richmond, and there put them incamp, while he went back to Savannah to see what the situation wasthere.It was during this trip that the last outrage was committed upon him.Halleck had been sent to Richmond to command Virginia, and had issuedorders prohibiting even Sherman's own troops from obeying his,Sherman's, orders.  Sherman met the papers on his return, containingthis order of Halleck, and very justly felt indignant at the outrage.On his arrival at Fortress Monroe returning from Savannah, Shermanreceived an invitation from Halleck to come to Richmond and be hisguest.  This he indignantly refused, and informed Halleck, furthermore,that he had seen his order.  He also stated that he was coming up totake command of his troops, and as he marched through it would probablybe as well for Halleck not to show himself, because he (Sherman) wouldnot be responsible for what some rash person might do throughindignation for the treatment he had received.  Very soon after that,Sherman received orders from me to proceed to Washington City, and to gointo camp on the south side of the city pending the mustering-out of thetroops.There was no incident worth noting in the march northward fromGoldsboro, to Richmond, or in that from Richmond to Washington City.The army, however, commanded by Sherman, which had been engaged in allthe battles of the West and had marched from the Mississippi through theSouthern States to the sea, from there to Goldsboro, and thence toWashington City, had passed over many of the battle-fields of the Armyof the Potomac, thus having seen, to a greater extent than any otherbody of troops, the entire theatre of the four years' war for thepreservation of the Union.The march of Sherman's army from Atlanta to the sea and north toGoldsboro, while it was not accompanied with the danger that wasanticipated, yet was magnificent in its results, and equally magnificentin the way it was conducted.  It had an important bearing, in variousways, upon the great object we had in view, that of closing the war.All the States east of the Mississippi River up to the State of Georgia,had felt the hardships of the war.  Georgia, and South Carolina, andalmost all of North Carolina, up to this time, had been exempt frominvasion by the Northern armies, except upon their immediate sea coasts.Their newspapers had given such an account of Confederate success, thatthe people who remained at home had been convinced that the Yankees hadbeen whipped from first to last, and driven from pillar to post, andthat now they could hardly be holding out for any other purpose than tofind a way out of the war with honor to themselves.Even during this march of Sherman's the newspapers in his front wereproclaiming daily that his army was nothing better than a mob of men whowere frightened out of their wits and hastening, panic-stricken, to tryto get under the cover of our navy for protection against the Southernpeople.  As the army was seen marching on triumphantly, however, theminds of the people became disabused and they saw the true state ofaffairs.  In turn they became disheartened, and would have been glad tosubmit without compromise.Another great advantage resulting from this march, and which wascalculated to hasten the end, was the fact that the great storehouse ofGeorgia was entirely cut off from the Confederate armies.  As the troopsadvanced north from Savannah, the destruction of the railroads in SouthCarolina and the southern part of North Carolina, further cut off theirresources and left the armies still in Virginia and North Carolinadependent for supplies upon a very small area of country, already verymuch exhausted of food and forage.In due time the two armies, one from Burkesville Junction and the otherfrom the neighborhood of Raleigh, North Carolina, arrived and went intocamp near the Capital, as directed.  The troops were hardy, being inuredto fatigue, and they appeared in their respective camps as ready and fitfor duty as they had ever been in their lives.  I doubt whether an equalbody of men of any nation, take them man for man, officer for officer,was ever gotten together that would have proved their equal in a greatbattle.The armies of Europe are machines; the men are brave and the officerscapable; but the majority of the soldiers in most of the nations ofEurope are taken from a class of people who are not very intelligent andwho have very little interest in the contest in which they are calledupon to take part.  Our armies were composed of men who were able toread, men who knew what they were fighting for, and could not be inducedto serve as soldiers, except in an emergency when the safety of thenation was involved, and so necessarily must have been more than equalto men who fought merely because they were brave and because they werethoroughly drilled and inured to hardships.There was nothing of particular importance occurred during the timethese troops were in camp before starting North.I remember one little incident which I will relate as an anecdotecharacteristic of Mr. Lincoln.  It occurred a day after I reachedWashington, and about the time General Meade reached Burkesville withthe army.  Governor Smith of Virginia had left Richmond with theConfederate States government, and had gone to Danville.  Supposing Iwas necessarily with the army at Burkesville, he addressed a letter tome there informing me that, as governor of the Commonwealth of the Stateof Virginia, he had temporarily removed the State capital from Richmondto Danville, and asking if he would be permitted to perform thefunctions of his office there without molestation by the Federalauthorities.  I give this letter only in substance.  He also inquired ofme whether in case he was not allowed to perform the duties of hisoffice, he with a few others might not be permitted to leave the countryand go abroad without interference.  General Meade being informed that aflag of truce was outside his pickets with a letter to me, at once sentout and had the letter brought in without informing the officer whobrought it that I was not present.  He read the letter and telegraphedme its contents. Meeting Mr. Lincoln shortly after receiving thisdispatch, I repeated its contents to him.  Mr. Lincoln, supposing I wasasking for instructions, said, in reply to that part of Governor Smith'sletter which inquired whether he with a few friends would be permittedto leave the country unmolested, that his position was like that of acertain Irishman (giving the name) he knew in Springfield who was verypopular with the people, a man of considerable promise, and very muchliked.  Unfortunately he had acquired the habit of drinking, and hisfriends could see that the habit was growing on him.  These friendsdetermined to make an effort to save him, and to do this they drew up apledge to abstain from all alcoholic drinks.  They asked Pat to jointhem in signing the pledge, and he consented.  He had been so long outof the habit of using plain water as a beverage that he resorted tosoda-water as a substitute.  After a few days this began to growdistasteful to him.  So holding the glass behind him, he said:  'Doctor,couldn't you drop a bit of brandy in that unbeknownst to myself.'I do not remember what the instructions were the President gave me, butI know that Governor Smith was not permitted to perform the duties ofhis office.  I also know that if Mr. Lincoln had been spared, therewould have been no efforts made to prevent any one from leaving thecountry who desired to do so.  He would have been equally willing topermit the return of the same expatriated citizens after they had timeto repent of their choice.On the 18th of May orders were issued by the adjutant-general for agrand review by the President and his cabinet of Sherman's and Meade'sarmies.  The review commenced on the 23d and lasted two days.  Meade'sarmy occupied over six hours of the first day in passing the grand standwhich had been erected in front of the President's house.  Shermanwitnessed this review from the grand stand which was occupied by thePresident and his cabinet.  Here he showed his resentment for the crueland harsh treatment that had unnecessarily been inflicted upon him bythe Secretary of War, by refusing to take his extended hand.Sherman's troops had been in camp on the south side of the Potomac.During the night of the 23d he crossed over and bivouacked not far fromthe Capitol.  Promptly at ten o'clock on the morning of the 24th, histroops commenced to pass in review.  Sherman's army made a differentappearance from that of the Army of the Potomac.  The latter had beenoperating where they received directly from the North full supplies offood and clothing regularly:  the review of this army therefore was thereview of a body of 65,000 well-drilled, well-disciplined and orderlysoldiers inured to hardship and fit for any duty, but without theexperience of gathering their own food and supplies in an enemy'scountry, and of being ever on the watch. Sherman's army was not sowell-dressed as the Army of the Potomac, but their marching could notbe excelled; they gave the appearance of men who had been thoroughlydrilled to endure hardships, either by long and continuous marches orthrough exposure to any climate, without the ordinary shelter of a camp.They exhibited also some of the order of march through Georgia where the'sweet potatoes sprung up from the ground' as Sherman's army wentmarching through.  In the rear of a company there would be a capturedhorse or mule loaded with small cooking utensils, captured chickens andother food picked up for the use of the men.  Negro families who hadfollowed the army would sometimes come along in the rear of a company,with three or four children packed upon a single mule, and the motherleading it.The sight was varied and grand:  nearly all day for two successive days,from the Capitol to the Treasury Building, could be seen a mass oforderly soldiers marching in columns of companies.  The National flagwas flying from almost every house and store; the windows were filledwith spectators; the door-steps and side-walks were crowded with coloredpeople and poor whites who did not succeed in securing better quartersfrom which to get a view of the grand armies.  The city was about asfull of strangers who had come to see the sights as it usually is oninauguration day when a new President takes his seat.It may not be out of place to again allude to President Lincoln and theSecretary of War, Mr. Stanton, who were the great conspicuous figures inthe executive branch of the government. There is no great difference ofopinion now, in the public mind, as to the characteristics of thePresident.  With Mr. Stanton the case is different.  They were the veryopposite of each other in almost every particular, except that eachpossessed great ability.  Mr. Lincoln gained influence over men bymaking them feel that it was a pleasure to serve him.  He preferredyielding his own wish to gratify others, rather than to insist uponhaving his own way.  It distressed him to disappoint others.  In mattersof public duty, however, he had what he wished, but in the leastoffensive way.  Mr. Stanton never questioned his own authority tocommand, unless resisted.  He cared nothing for the feeling of others.In fact it seemed to be pleasanter to him to disappoint than to gratify.He felt no hesitation in assuming the functions of the executive, or inacting without advising with him.  If his act was not sustained, hewould change it--if he saw the matter would be followed up until he didso.It was generally supposed that these two officials formed the complementof each other.  The Secretary was required to prevent the President'sbeing imposed upon.  The President was required in the more responsibleplace of seeing that injustice was not done to others.  I do not knowthat this view of these two men is still entertained by the majority ofthe people.  It is not a correct view, however, in my estimation.  Mr.Lincoln did not require a guardian to aid him in the fulfilment of apublic trust.Mr. Lincoln was not timid, and he was willing to trust his generals inmaking and executing their plans.  The Secretary was very timid, and itwas impossible for him to avoid interfering with the armies covering thecapital when it was sought to defend it by an offensive movement againstthe army guarding the Confederate capital.  He could see our weakness,but he could not see that the enemy was in danger.  The enemy would nothave been in danger if Mr. Stanton had been in the field.  Thesecharacteristics of the two officials were clearly shown shortly afterEarly came so near getting into the capital.Among the army and corps commanders who served with me during the warbetween the States, and who attracted much public attention, but ofwhose ability as soldiers I have not yet given any estimate, are Meade,Hancock, Sedgwick, Burnside, Terry and Hooker.  There were others ofgreat merit, such as Griffin, Humphreys, Wright and Mackenzie.  Of thosefirst named, Burnside at one time had command of the Army of thePotomac, and later of the Army of the Ohio.  Hooker also commanded theArmy of the Potomac for a short time.General Meade was an officer of great merit, with drawbacks to hisusefulness that were beyond his control.  He had been an officer of theengineer corps before the war, and consequently had never served withtroops until he was over forty-six years of age.  He never had, Ibelieve, a command of less than a brigade.  He saw clearly anddistinctly the position of the enemy, and the topography of the countryin front of his own position.  His first idea was to take advantage ofthe lay of the ground, sometimes without reference to the direction wewanted to move afterwards.  He was subordinate to his superiors in rankto the extent that he could execute an order which changed his own planswith the same zeal he would have displayed if the plan had been his own.He was brave and conscientious, and commanded the respect of all whoknew him.  He was unfortunately of a temper that would get beyond hiscontrol, at times, and make him speak to officers of high rank in themost offensive manner.  No one saw this fault more plainly than hehimself, and no one regretted it more.  This made it unpleasant attimes, even in battle, for those around him to approach him even withinformation.  In spite of this defect he was a most valuable officer anddeserves a high place in the annals of his country.General Burnside was an officer who was generally liked and respected.He was not, however, fitted to command an army.  No one knew this betterthan himself.  He always admitted his blunders, and extenuated those ofofficers under him beyond what they were entitled to.  It was hardly hisfault that he was ever assigned to a separate command.Of Hooker I saw but little during the war.  I had known him very wellbefore, however.  Where I did see him, at Chattanooga, his achievementin bringing his command around the point of Lookout Mountain and intoChattanooga Valley was brilliant.  I nevertheless regarded him as adangerous man.  He was not subordinate to his superiors.  He wasambitious to the extent of caring nothing for the rights of others.  Hisdisposition was, when engaged in battle, to get detached from the mainbody of the army and exercise a separate command, gathering to hisstandard all he could of his juniors.Hancock stands the most conspicuous figure of all the general officerswho did not exercise a separate command.  He commanded a corps longerthan any other one, and his name was never mentioned as having committedin battle a blunder for which he was responsible.  He was a man of veryconspicuous personal appearance.  Tall, well-formed and, at the time ofwhich I now write, young and fresh-looking, he presented an appearancethat would attract the attention of an army as he passed.  His genialdisposition made him friends, and his personal courage and his presencewith his command in the thickest of the fight won for him the confidenceof troops serving under him.  No matter how hard the fight, the 2d corpsalways felt that their commander was looking after them.Sedgwick was killed at Spottsylvania before I had an opportunity offorming an estimate of his qualifications as a soldier from personalobservation.  I had known him in Mexico when both of us werelieutenants, and when our service gave no indication that either of uswould ever be equal to the command of a brigade. He stood very high inthe army, however, as an officer and a man. He was brave andconscientious.  His ambition was not great, and he seemed to dreadresponsibility.  He was willing to do any amount of battling, but alwayswanted some one else to direct. He declined the command of the Army ofthe Potomac once, if not oftener.General Alfred H. Terry came into the army as a volunteer without amilitary education.  His way was won without political influence up toan important separate command--the expedition against Fort Fisher, inJanuary, 1865.  His success there was most brilliant, and won for himthe rank of brigadier-general in the regular army and of major-generalof volunteers.  He is a man who makes friends of those under him by hisconsideration of their wants and their dues.  As a commander, he wontheir confidence by his coolness in action and by his clearness ofperception in taking in the situation under which he was placed at anygiven time.Griffin, Humphreys, and Mackenzie were good corps commanders, but cameinto that position so near to the close of the war as not to attractpublic attention.  All three served as such, in the last campaign of thearmies of the Potomac and the James, which culminated at AppomattoxCourt House, on the 9th of April, 1865.  The sudden collapse of therebellion monopolized attention to the exclusion of almost everythingelse.  I regarded Mackenzie as the most promising young officer in thearmy.  Graduating at West Point, as he did, during the second year ofthe war, he had won his way up to the command of a corps before itsclose.  This he did upon his own merit and without influence.CONCLUSION.The cause of the great War of the Rebellion against the United Statuswill have to be attributed to slavery.  For some years before the warbegan it was a trite saying among some politicians that 'A state halfslave and half free cannot exist.'  All must become slave or all free,or the state will go down.  I took no part myself in any such view ofthe case at the time, but since the war is over, reviewing the wholequestion, I have come to the conclusion that the saying is quite true.Slavery was an institution that required unusual guarantees for itssecurity wherever it existed; and in a country like ours where thelarger portion of it was free territory inhabited by an intelligent andwell-to-do population, the people would naturally have but littlesympathy with demands upon them for its protection.  Hence the people ofthe South were dependent upon keeping control of the general governmentto secure the perpetuation of their favorite institution.  They wereenabled to maintain this control long after the States where slaveryexisted had ceased to have the controlling power, through the assistancethey received from odd men here and there throughout the NorthernStates.  They saw their power waning, and this led them to encroach uponthe prerogatives and independence of the Northern States by enactingsuch laws as the Fugitive Slave Law.  By this law every Northern manwas obliged, when properly summoned, to turn out and help apprehendthe runaway slave of a Southern man.  Northern marshals becameslave-catchers, and Northern courts had to contribute to the supportand protection of the institution.This was a degradation which the North would not permit any longer thanuntil they could get the power to expunge such laws from the statutebooks.  Prior to the time of these encroachments the great majority ofthe people of the North had no particular quarrel with slavery, so longas they were not forced to have it themselves.  But they were notwilling to play the role of police for the South in the protection ofthis particular institution.In the early days of the country, before we had railroads, telegraphsand steamboats--in a word, rapid transit of any sort--the States wereeach almost a separate nationality.  At that time the subject of slaverycaused but little or no disturbance to the public mind.  But the countrygrew, rapid transit was established, and trade and commerce between theStates got to be so much greater than before, that the power of theNational government became more felt and recognized and, therefore, hadto be enlisted in the cause of this institution.It is probably well that we had the war when we did.  We are better offnow than we would have been without it, and have made more rapidprogress than we otherwise should have made.  The civilized nations ofEurope have been stimulated into unusual activity, so that commerce,trade, travel, and thorough acquaintance among people of differentnationalities, has become common; whereas, before, it was but the fewwho had ever had the privilege of going beyond the limits of their owncountry or who knew anything about other people.  Then, too, ourrepublican institutions were regarded as experiments up to the breakingout of the rebellion, and monarchical Europe generally believed that ourrepublic was a rope of sand that would part the moment the slighteststrain was brought upon it.  Now it has shown itself capable of dealingwith one of the greatest wars that was ever made, and our people haveproven themselves to be the most formidable in war of any nationality.But this war was a fearful lesson, and should teach us the necessity ofavoiding wars in the future.The conduct of some of the European states during our troubles shows thelack of conscience of communities where the responsibility does not comeupon a single individual.  Seeing a nation that extended from ocean toocean, embracing the better part of a continent, growing as we weregrowing in population, wealth and intelligence, the European nationsthought it would be well to give us a check.  We might, possibly, aftera while threaten their peace, or, at least, the perpetuity of theirinstitutions.  Hence, England was constantly finding fault with theadministration at Washington because we were not able to keep up aneffective blockade.  She also joined, at first, with France and Spain insetting up an Austrian prince upon the throne in Mexico, totallydisregarding any rights or claims that Mexico had of being treated as anindependent power.  It is true they trumped up grievances as a pretext,but they were only pretexts which can always be found when wanted.Mexico, in her various revolutions, had been unable to give thatprotection to the subjects of foreign nations which she would have likedto give, and some of her revolutionary leaders had forced loans fromthem.  Under pretence of protecting their citizens, these nations seizedupon Mexico as a foothold for establishing a European monarchy upon ourcontinent, thus threatening our peace at home.  I, myself, regarded thisas a direct act of war against the United States by the powers engaged,and supposed as a matter of course that the United States would treat itas such when their hands were free to strike.  I often spoke of thematter to Mr. Lincoln and the Secretary of War, but never heard anyspecial views from them to enable me to judge what they thought or feltabout it.  I inferred that they felt a good deal as I did, but wereunwilling to commit themselves while we had our own troubles upon ourhands.All of the powers except France very soon withdrew from the armedintervention for the establishment of an Austrian prince upon the throneof Mexico; but the governing people of these countries continued to theclose of the war to throw obstacles in our way.  After the surrender ofLee, therefore, entertaining the opinion here expressed, I sent Sheridanwith a corps to the Rio Grande to have him where he might aid Juarez inexpelling the French from Mexico.  These troops got off before theycould be stopped; and went to the Rio Grande, where Sheridan distributedthem up and down the river, much to the consternation of the troops inthe quarter of Mexico bordering on that stream.  This soon led to arequest from France that we should withdraw our troops from the RioGrande and to negotiations for the withdrawal of theirs.  FinallyBazaine was withdrawn from Mexico by order of the French Government.From that day the empire began to totter.  Mexico was then able tomaintain her independence without aid from us.France is the traditional ally and friend of the United States.  I didnot blame France for her part in the scheme to erect a monarchy upon theruins of the Mexican Republic.  That was the scheme of one man, animitator without genius or merit.  He had succeeded in stealing thegovernment of his country, and made a change in its form against thewishes and instincts of his people.  He tried to play the part of thefirst Napoleon, without the ability to sustain that role.  He sought bynew conquests to add to his empire and his glory; but the signal failureof his scheme of conquest was the precursor of his own overthrow.Like our own war between the States, the Franco-Prussian war was anexpensive one; but it was worth to France all it cost her people.  Itwas the completion of the downfall of Napoleon III.  The beginning waswhen he landed troops on this continent.  Failing here, the prestige ofhis name--all the prestige he ever had--was gone.  He must achieve asuccess or fall.  He tried to strike down his neighbor, Prussia--andfell.I never admired the character of the first Napoleon; but I recognize hisgreat genius.  His work, too, has left its impress for good on the faceof Europe.  The third Napoleon could have no claim to having done a goodor just act.To maintain peace in the future it is necessary to be prepared for war.There can scarcely be a possible chance of a conflict, such as the lastone, occurring among our own people again; but, growing as we are, inpopulation, wealth and military power, we may become the envy of nationswhich led us in all these particulars only a few years ago; and unlesswe are prepared for it we may be in danger of a combined movement beingsome day made to crush us out.  Now, scarcely twenty years after thewar, we seem to have forgotten the lessons it taught, and are going onas if in the greatest security, without the power to resist an invasionby the fleets of fourth-rate European powers for a time until we couldprepare for them.We should have a good navy, and our sea-coast defences should be put inthe finest possible condition.  Neither of these cost much when it isconsidered where the money goes, and what we get in return.  Moneyexpended in a fine navy, not only adds to our security and tends toprevent war in the future, but is very material aid to our commerce withforeign nations in the meantime.  Money spent upon sea-coast defences isspent among our own people, and all goes back again among the people.The work accomplished, too, like that of the navy, gives us a feeling ofsecurity.England's course towards the United States during the rebellionexasperated the people of this country very much against the mothercountry.  I regretted it.  England and the United States are naturalallies, and should be the best of friends.  They speak one language, andare related by blood and other ties.  We together, or even eitherseparately, are better qualified than any other people to establishcommerce between all the nationalities of the world.England governs her own colonies, and particularly those embracingthe people of different races from her own, better than any othernation.  She is just to the conquered, but rigid.  She makes themself-supporting, but gives the benefit of labor to the laborer.  Shedoes not seem to look upon the colonies as outside possessions which sheis at liberty to work for the support and aggrandizement of the homegovernment.The hostility of England to the United States during our rebellion wasnot so much real as it was apparent.  It was the hostility of theleaders of one political party.  I am told that there was no time duringthe civil war when they were able to get up in England a demonstrationin favor of secession, while these were constantly being gotten up infavor of the Union, or, as they called it, in favor of the North.  Evenin Manchester, which suffered so fearfully by having the cotton cut offfrom her mills, they had a monster demonstration in favor of the Northat the very time when their workmen were almost famishing.It is possible that the question of a conflict between races may come upin the future, as did that between freedom and slavery before.  Thecondition of the colored man within our borders may become a source ofanxiety, to say the least.  But he was brought to our shores bycompulsion, and he now should be considered as having as good a right toremain here as any other class of our citizens.  It was looking to asettlement of this question that led me to urge the annexation of SantoDomingo during the time I was President of the United States.Santo Domingo was freely offered to us, not only by the administration,but by all the people, almost without price. The island is upon ourshores, is very fertile, and is capable of supporting fifteen millionsof people.  The products of the soil are so valuable that labor in herfields would be so compensated as to enable those who wished to go thereto quickly repay the cost of their passage.  I took it that the coloredpeople would go there in great numbers, so as to have independent statesgoverned by their own race.  They would still be States of the Union,and under the protection of the General Government; but the citizenswould be almost wholly colored.By the war with Mexico, we had acquired, as we have seen, territoryalmost equal in extent to that we already possessed. It was seen thatthe volunteers of the Mexican war largely composed the pioneers tosettle up the Pacific coast country. Their numbers, however, werescarcely sufficient to be a nucleus for the population of the importantpoints of the territory acquired by that war.  After our rebellion, whenso many young men were at liberty to return to their homes, they foundthey were not satisfied with the farm, the store, or the work-shop ofthe villages, but wanted larger fields.  The mines of the mountainsfirst attracted them; but afterwards they found that rich valleys andproductive grazing and farming lands were there.  This territory, thegeography of which was not known to us at the close of the rebellion, isnow as well mapped as any portion of our country.  Railroads traverse itin every direction, north, south, east, and west.  The mines are worked.The high lands are used for grazing purposes, and rich agriculturallands are found in many of the valleys.  This is the work of thevolunteer.  It is probable that the Indians would have had control ofthese lands for a century yet but for the war.  We must conclude,therefore, that wars are not always evils unmixed with some good.Prior to the rebellion the great mass of the people were satisfied toremain near the scenes of their birth.  In fact an immense majority ofthe whole people did not feel secure against coming to want should theymove among entire strangers.  So much was the country divided into smallcommunities that localized idioms had grown up, so that you could almosttell what section a person was from by hearing him speak.  Before, newterritories were settled by a 'class'; people who shunned contact withothers; people who, when the country began to settle up around them,would push out farther from civilization.  Their guns furnished meat,and the cultivation of a very limited amount of the soil, their breadand vegetables.  All the streams abounded with fish.  Trapping wouldfurnish pelts to be brought into the States once a year, to pay fornecessary articles which they could not raise--powder, lead, whiskey,tobacco and some store goods.  Occasionally some little articles ofluxury would enter into these purchases--a quarter of a pound of tea,two or three pounds of coffee, more of sugar, some playing cards, and ifanything was left over of the proceeds of the sale, more whiskey.Little was known of the topography of the country beyond the settlementsof these frontiersmen.  This is all changed now. The war begot a spiritof independence and enterprise.  The feeling now is, that a youth mustcut loose from his old surroundings to enable him to get up in theworld.  There is now such a commingling of the people that particularidioms and pronunciation are no longer localized to any great extent;the country has filled up 'from the centre all around to the sea';railroads connect the two oceans and all parts of the interior; maps,nearly perfect, of every part of the country are now furnished thestudent of geography.The war has made us a nation of great power and intelligence. We havebut little to do to preserve peace, happiness and prosperity at home,and the respect of other nations.  Our experience ought to teach us thenecessity of the first; our power secures the latter.I feel that we are on the eve of a new era, when there is to be greatharmony between the Federal and Confederate.  I cannot stay to be aliving witness to the correctness of this prophecy; but I feel it withinme that it is to be so.  The universally kind feeling expressed for meat a time when it was supposed that each day would prove my last, seemedto me the beginning of the answer to 'Let us have peace.'The expression of these kindly feelings were not restricted to a sectionof the country, nor to a division of the people.  They came fromindividual citizens of all nationalities; from all denominations--theProtestant, the Catholic, and the Jew; and from the various societies ofthe land--scientific, educational, religious or otherwise.  Politics didnot enter into the matter at all.I am not egotist enough to suppose all this significance should be givenbecause I was the object of it.  But the war between the States was avery bloody and a very costly war.  One side or the other had to yieldprinciples they deemed dearer than life before it could be brought to anend.  I commanded the whole of the mighty host engaged on the victoriousside.  I was, no matter whether deservedly so or not, a representativeof that side of the controversy.  It is a significant and gratifyingfact that Confederates should have joined heartily in this spontaneousmove.  I hope the good feeling inaugurated may continue to the end.APPENDIX.REPORT OF LIEUTENANT-GENERAL U. S. GRANT, OF THE UNITED STATES ARMIES1864-65.HEADQUARTERS ARMIES OF THE UNITED STATES, WASHINGTON, D. C., July 22,1865.HON. E. M. STANTON, Secretary of War.SIR:  I have the honor to submit the following report of the operationsof the Armies of the United States from the date of my appointment tocommand the same.From an early period in the rebellion I had been impressed with the ideathat active and continuous operations of all the troops that could bebrought into the field, regardless of season and weather, were necessaryto a speedy termination of the war.  The resources of the enemy and hisnumerical strength were far inferior to ours; but as an offset to this,we had a vast territory, with a population hostile to the government, togarrison, and long lines of river and railroad communications toprotect, to enable us to supply the operating armies.The armies in the East and West acted independently and without concert,like a balky team, no two ever pulling together, enabling the enemy touse to great advantage his interior lines of communication fortransporting troops from East to West, reinforcing the army mostvigorously pressed, and to furlough large numbers, during seasons ofinactivity on our part, to go to their homes and do the work ofproducing, for the support of their armies.  It was a question whetherour numerical strength and resources were not more than balanced bythese disadvantages and the enemy's superior position.From the first, I was firm in the conviction that no peace could be hadthat would be stable and conducive to the happiness of the people, bothNorth and South, until the military power of the rebellion was entirelybroken.I therefore determined, first, to use the greatest number of troopspracticable against the armed force of the enemy; preventing him fromusing the same force at different seasons against first one and thenanother of our armies, and the possibility of repose for refitting andproducing necessary supplies for carrying on resistance.  Second, tohammer continuously against the armed force of the enemy and hisresources, until by mere attrition, if in no other way, there should benothing left to him but an equal submission with the loyal section ofour common country to the constitution and laws of the land.These views have been kept constantly in mind, and orders given andcampaigns made to carry them out.  Whether they might have been betterin conception and execution is for the people, who mourn the loss offriends fallen, and who have to pay the pecuniary cost, to say.  All Ican say is, that what I have done has been done conscientiously, to thebest of my ability, and in what I conceived to be for the best interestsof the whole country.At the date when this report begins, the situation of the contendingforces was about as follows:  The Mississippi River was stronglygarrisoned by Federal troops, from St.  Louis, Missouri, to its mouth.The line of the Arkansas was also held, thus giving us armed possessionof all west of the Mississippi, north of that stream.  A few points inSouthern Louisiana, not remote from the river, were held by us, togetherwith a small garrison at and near the mouth of the Rio Grande.  All thebalance of the vast territory of Arkansas, Louisiana, and Texas was inthe almost undisputed possession of the enemy, with an army of probablynot less than eighty thousand effective men, that could have beenbrought into the field had there been sufficient opposition to havebrought them out.  The let-alone policy had demoralized this force sothat probably but little more than one-half of it was ever present ingarrison at any one time.  But the one-half, or forty thousand men, withthe bands of guerillas scattered through Missouri, Arkansas, and alongthe Mississippi River, and the disloyal character of much of thepopulation, compelled the use of a large number of troops to keepnavigation open on the river, and to protect the loyal people to thewest of it.  To the east of the Mississippi we held substantially withthe line of the Tennessee and Holston rivers, running eastward toinclude nearly all of the State of Tennessee.  South of Chattanooga, asmall foothold had been obtained in Georgia, sufficient to protect EastTennessee from incursions from the enemy's force at Dalton, Georgia.West Virginia was substantially within our lines.  Virginia, with theexception of the northern border, the Potomac River, a small area aboutthe mouth of James River, covered by the troops at Norfolk and FortMonroe, and the territory covered by the Army of the Potomac lying alongthe Rapidan, was in the possession of the enemy.  Along the sea-coastfootholds had been obtained at Plymouth, Washington, and New Bern, inNorth Carolina; Beaufort, Folly and Morris Islands, Hilton Head, FortPulaski, and Port Royal, in South Carolina; Fernandina and St.Augustine, in Florida. Key West and Pensacola were also in ourpossession, while all the important ports were blockaded by the navy.The accompanying map, a copy of which was sent to General Sherman andother commanders in March, 1864, shows by red lines the territoryoccupied by us at the beginning of the rebellion, and at the opening ofthe campaign of 1864, while those in blue are the lines which it wasproposed to occupy.Behind the Union lines there were many bands of guerillas and a largepopulation disloyal to the government, making it necessary to guardevery foot of road or river used in supplying our armies.  In the South,a reign of military despotism prevailed, which made every man and boycapable of bearing arms a soldier; and those who could not bear arms inthe field acted as provosts for collecting deserters and returning them.This enabled the enemy to bring almost his entire strength into thefield.The enemy had concentrated the bulk of his forces east of theMississippi into two armies, commanded by Generals R. E. Lee and J. E.Johnston, his ablest and best generals.  The army commanded by Leeoccupied the south bank of the Rapidan, extending from Mine Runwestward, strongly intrenched, covering and defending Richmond, therebel capital, against the Army of the Potomac. The army under Johnstonoccupied a strongly intrenched position at Dalton, Georgia, covering anddefending Atlanta, Georgia, a place of great importance as a railroadcentre, against the armies under Major-General W. T. Sherman.  Inaddition to these armies he had a large cavalry force under Forrest, inNorth-east Mississippi; a considerable force, of all arms, in theShenandoah Valley, and in the western part of Virginia and extremeeastern part of Tennessee; and also confronting our sea-coast garrisons,and holding blockaded ports where we had no foothold upon land.These two armies, and the cities covered and defended by them, were themain objective points of the campaign.Major-General W. T. Sherman, who was appointed to the command of theMilitary Division of the Mississippi, embracing all the armies andterritory east of the Mississippi River to the Alleghanies and theDepartment of Arkansas, west of the Mississippi, had the immediatecommand of the armies operating against Johnston.Major-General George G. Meade had the immediate command of the Army ofthe Potomac, from where I exercised general supervision of the movementsof all our armies.General Sherman was instructed to move against Johnston's army, to breakit up, and to go into the interior of the enemy's country as far as hecould, inflicting all the damage he could upon their war resources.  Ifthe enemy in his front showed signs of joining Lee, to follow him up tothe full extent of his ability, while I would prevent the concentrationof Lee upon him, if it was in the power of the Army of the Potomac to doso.  More specific written instructions were not given, for the reasonthat I had talked over with him the plans of the campaign, and wassatisfied that he understood them and would execute them to the fullestextent possible.Major-General N. P. Banks, then on an expedition up Red River againstShreveport, Louisiana (which had been organized previous to myappointment to command), was notified by me on the 15th of March, of theimportance it was that Shreveport should be taken at the earliESTJossible day, and that if he found that the taking of it would occupyfrom ten to fifteen days' more time than General Sherman had given histroops to be absent from their command, he would send them back at thetime specified by General Sherman, even if it led to the abandonment ofthe main object of the Red River expedition, for this force wasnecessary to movements east of the Mississippi; that should hisexpedition prove successful, he would hold Shreveport and the Red Riverwith such force as he might deem necessary, and return the balance ofhis troops to the neighborhood of New Orleans, commencing no move forthe further acquisition of territory, unless it was to make that thenheld by him more easily held; that it might be a part of the springcampaign to move against Mobile; that it certainly would be, if troopsenough could be obtained to make it without embarrassing othermovements; that New Orleans would be the point of departure for such anexpedition; also, that I had directed General Steele to make a real movefrom Arkansas, as suggested by him (General Banks), instead of ademonstration, as Steele thought advisable.On the 31st of March, in addition to the foregoing notification anddirections, he was instructed as follows:'1st.  If successful in your expedition against Shreveport, that youturn over the defence of the Red River to General Steele and the navy.'2d.  That you abandon Texas entirely, with the exception of your holdupon the Rio Grande.  This can be held with four thousand men, if theywill turn their attention immediately to fortifying their positions.  Atleast one-half of the force required for this service might be takenfrom the colored troops.'3d.  By properly fortifying on the Mississippi River, the force toguard it from Port Hudson to New Orleans can be reduced to ten thousandmen, if not to a less number.  Six thousand more would then hold all therest of the territory necessary to hold until active operations canagain be resumed west of the river. According to your last return, thiswould give you a force of over thirty thousand effective men with whichto move against Mobile.  To this I expect to add five thousand men fromMissouri.  If however, you think the force here stated too small to holdthe territory regarded as necessary to hold possession of, I would sayconcentrate at least twenty-five thousand men of your present commandfor operations against Mobile.  With these and such additions as I cangive you from elsewhere, lose no time in making a demonstration, to befollowed by an attack upon Mobile.  Two or more iron-clads will beordered to report to Admiral Farragut.  This gives him a strong navalfleet with which to co-operate.  You can make your own arrangements withthe admiral for his co-operation, and select your own line of approach.My own idea of the matter is that Pascagoula should be your base; but,from your long service in the Gulf Department, you will know best aboutthe matter.  It is intended that your movements shall be co-operativewith movements elsewhere, and you cannot now start too soon.  All Iwould now add is, that you commence the concentration of your forces atonce.  Preserve a profound secrecy of what you intend doing, and startat the earliest possible moment.'U. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General.'MAJOR-GENERAL N. P. BANKS.'Major-General Meade was instructed that Lee's army would be hisobjective point; that wherever Lee went he would go also.  For hismovement two plans presented themselves:  One to cross the Rapidan belowLee, moving by his right flank; the other above, moving by his left.Each presented advantages over the other, with corresponding objections.By crossing above, Lee would be cut off from all chance of ignoringRichmond or going north on a raid.  But if we took this route, all wedid would have to be done whilst the rations we started with held out;besides, it separated us from Butler, so that he could not be directedhow to cooperate.  If we took the other route, Brandy Station could beused as a base of supplies until another was secured on the York orJames rivers.  Of these, however, it was decided to take the lowerroute.The following letter of instruction was addressed to Major-General B. F.Butler:'FORT MONROE, VIRGINIA, April 2, 1864.'GENERAL:-In the spring campaign, which it is desirable shall commenceat as early a day as practicable, it is proposed to have cooperativeaction of all the armies in the field, as far as this object can beaccomplished.'It will not be possible to unite our armies into two or three largeones to act as so many units, owing to the absolute necessity of holdingon to the territory already taken from the enemy.  But, generallyspeaking, concentration can be practically effected by armies moving tothe interior of the enemy's country from the territory they have toguard.  By such movement, they interpose themselves between the enemyand the country to be guarded, thereby reducing the number necessary toguard important points, or at least occupy the attention of a part ofthe enemy's force, if no greater object is gained. Lee's army andRichmond being the greater objects towards which our attention must bedirected in the next campaign, it is desirable to unite all the force wecan against them.  The necessity of covering Washington with the Army ofthe Potomac, and of covering your department with your army, makes itimpossible to unite these forces at the beginning of any move. Ipropose, therefore, what comes nearest this of anything that seemspracticable:  The Army of the Potomac will act from its present base,Lee's army being the objective point.  You will collect all the forcesfrom your command that can be spared from garrison duty--I should saynot less than twenty thousand effective men--to operate on the southside of James River, Richmond being your objective point.  To the forceyou already have will be added about ten thousand men from SouthCarolina, under Major-General Gillmore, who will command them in person.Major-General W. F. Smith is ordered to report to you, to command thetroops sent into the field from your own department.'General Gillmore will be ordered to report to you at Fortress Monroe,with all the troops on transports, by the 18th instant, or as soonthereafter as practicable.  Should you not receive notice by that timeto move, you will make such disposition of them and your other forces asyou may deem best calculated to deceive the enemy as to the real move tobe made.'When you are notified to move, take City Point with as much force aspossible.  Fortify, or rather intrench, at once, and concentrate allyour troops for the field there as rapidly as you can.  From City Pointdirections cannot be given at this time for your further movements.'The fact that has already been stated--that is, that Richmond is to beyour objective point, and that there is to be co-operation between yourforce and the Army of the Potomac--must be your guide.  This indicatesthe necessity of your holding close to the south bank of the James Riveras you advance.  Then, should the enemy be forced into his intrenchmentsin Richmond, the Army of the Potomac would follow, and by means oftransports the two armies would become a unit.'All the minor details of your advance are left entirely to yourdirection. If, however, you think it practicable to use your cavalrysouth of you, so as to cut the railroad about Hicksford, about the timeof the general advance, it would be of immense advantage.'You will please forward for my information, at the earliest practicableday, all orders, details, and instructions you may give for theexecution of this order.'U. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General.'MAJOR-GENERAL B. F. BUTLER.'On the 16th these instructions were substantially reiterated. On the19th, in order to secure full co-operation between his army and that ofGeneral Meade, he was informed that I expected him to move from FortMonroe the same day that General Meade moved from Culpeper.  The exacttime I was to telegraph him as soon as it was fixed, and that it wouldnot be earlier than the 27th of April; that it was my intention to fightLee between Culpeper and Richmond, if he would stand.  Should he,however, fall back into Richmond, I would follow up and make a junctionwith his (General Butler's) army on the James River; that, could I becertain he would be able to invest Richmond on the south side, so as tohave his left resting on the James, above the city, I would form thejunction there; that circumstances might make this course advisableanyhow; that he should use every exertion to secure footing as far upthe south side of the river as he could, and as soon as possible afterthe receipt of orders to move; that if he could not carry the city, heshould at least detain as large a force there as possible.In co-operation with the main movements against Lee and Johnston, I wasdesirous of using all other troops necessarily kept in departmentsremote from the fields of immediate operations, and also those kept inthe background for the protection of our extended lines between theloyal States and the armies operating against them.A very considerable force, under command of Major-General Sigel, was soheld for the protection of West Virginia, and the frontiers of Marylandand Pennsylvania.  Whilst these troops could not be withdrawn to distantfields without exposing the North to invasion by comparatively smallbodies of the enemy, they could act directly to their front, and givebetter protection than if lying idle in garrison.  By such a movementthey would either compel the enemy to detach largely for the protectionof his supplies and lines of communication, or he would lose them.General Sigel was therefore directed to organize all his available forceinto two expeditions, to move from Beverly and Charleston, under commandof Generals Ord and Crook, against the East Tennessee and VirginiaRailroad. Subsequently, General Ord having been relieved at his ownrequest, General Sigel was instructed at his own suggestion, to give upthe expedition by Beverly, and to form two columns, one under GeneralCrook, on the Kanawha, numbering about ten thousand men, and one on theShenandoah, numbering about seven thousand men.  The one on theShenandoah to assemble between Cumberland and the Shenandoah, and theinfantry and artillery advanced to Cedar Creek with such cavalry ascould be made available at the moment, to threaten the enemy in theShenandoah Valley, and advance as far as possible; while General Crookwould take possession of Lewisburg with part of his force and move downthe Tennessee Railroad, doing as much damage as he could, destroying theNew River Bridge and the salt-works, at Saltville, Va.Owing to the weather and bad condition of the roads, operations weredelayed until the 1st of May, when, everything being in readiness andthe roads favorable, orders were given for a general movement of all thearmies not later than the 4th of May.My first object being to break the military power of the rebellion, andcapture the enemy's important strongholds, made me desirous that GeneralButler should succeed in his movement against Richmond, as that wouldtend more than anything else, unless it were the capture of Lee's army,to accomplish this desired result in the East. If he failed, it was mydetermination, by hard fighting, either to compel Lee to retreat, or toso cripple him that he could not detach a large force to go north, andstill retain enough for the defence of Richmond.  It was wellunderstood, by both Generals Butler and Meade, before starting on thecampaign, that it was my intention to put both their armies south of theJames River, in case of failure to destroy Lee without it.Before giving General Butler his instructions, I visited him at FortMonroe, and in conversation pointed out the apparent importance ofgetting possession of Petersburg, and destroying railroad communicationas far south as possible.  Believing, however, in the practicability ofcapturing Richmond unless it was reinforced, I made that the objectivepoint of his operations.  As the Army of the Potomac was to movesimultaneously with him, Lee could not detach from his army with safety,and the enemy did not have troops elsewhere to bring to the defence ofthe city in time to meet a rapid movement from the north of James River.I may here state that, commanding all the armies as I did, I tried, asfar as possible, to leave General Meade in independent command of theArmy of the Potomac.  My instructions for that army were all throughhim, and were general in their nature, leaving all the details and theexecution to him.  The campaigns that followed proved him to be theright man in the right place.  His commanding always in the presence ofan officer superior to him in rank, has drawn from him much of thatpublic attention that his zeal and ability entitle him to, and which hewould otherwise have received.The movement of the Army of the Potomac commenced early on the morningof the 4th of May, under the immediate direction and orders ofMajor-General Meade, pursuant to instructions.  Before night, the wholearmy was across the Rapidan (the fifth and sixth corps crossing atGermania Ford, and the second corps at Ely's Ford, the cavalry, underMajor-General Sheridan, moving in advance,) with the greater part of itstrains, numbering about four thousand wagons, meeting with but slightopposition.  The average distance travelled by the troops that day wasabout twelve miles.  This I regarded as a great success, and it removedfrom my mind the most serious apprehensions I had entertained, that ofcrossing the river in the face of an active, large, well-appointed, andably commanded army, and how so large a train was to be carried througha hostile country, and protected.  Early on the 5th, the advance corps(the fifth, Major-General G. K. Warren commanding) met and engaged theenemy outside his intrenchments near Mine Run.  The battle ragedfuriously all day, the whole army being brought into the fight as fastas the corps could be got upon the field, which, considering the densityof the forest and narrowness of the roads, was done with commendablepromptness.General Burnside, with the ninth corps, was, at the time the Army of thePotomac moved, left with the bulk of his corps at the crossing of theRappahannock River and Alexandria Railroad, holding the road back toBull Run, with instructions not to move until he received notice that acrossing of the Rapidan was secured, but to move promptly as soon assuch notice was received.  This crossing he was apprised of on theafternoon of the 4th.  By six o'clock of the morning of the 6th he wasleading his corps into action near the Wilderness Tavern, some of histroops having marched a distance of over thirty miles, crossing both theRappahannock and Rapidan rivers.  Considering that a large proportion,probably two-thirds of his command, was composed of new troops,unaccustomed to marches, and carrying the accoutrements of a soldier,this was a remarkable march.The battle of the Wilderness was renewed by us at five o'clock on themorning of the 6th, and continued with unabated fury until darkness setin, each army holding substantially the same position that they had onthe evening of the 5th.  After dark, the enemy made a feeble attempt toturn our right flank, capturing several hundred prisoners and creatingconsiderable confusion.  But the promptness of General Sedgwick, who waspersonally present and commanded that part of our line, soon reformed itand restored order.  On the morning of the 7th, reconnoissances showedthat the enemy had fallen behind his intrenched lines, with pickets tothe front, covering a part of the battle-field.  From this it wasevident to my mind that the two days' fighting had satisfied him of hisinability to further maintain the contest in the open field,notwithstanding his advantage of position, and that he would wait anattack behind his works. I therefore determined to push on and put mywhole force between him and Richmond; and orders were at once issued fora movement by his right flank.  On the night of the 7th, the march wascommenced towards Spottsylvania Court House, the fifth corps moving onthe most direct road.  But the enemy having become apprised of ourmovement, and having the shorter line, was enabled to reach there first.On the 8th, General Warren met a force of the enemy, which had been sentout to oppose and delay his advance, to gain time to fortify the linetaken up at Spottsylvania.  This force was steadily driven back on themain force, within the recently constructed works, after considerablefighting, resulting in severe loss to both sides.  On the morning of the9th, General Sheridan started on a raid against the enemy's lines ofcommunication with Richmond.  The 9th, 10th, and 11th were spent inmanoeuvring and fighting, without decisive results.  Among the killed onthe 9th was that able and distinguished soldier Major-General JohnSedgwick, commanding the sixth army corps.  Major-General H. G. Wrightsucceeded him in command.  Early on the morning of the 12th a generalattack was made on the enemy in position.  The second corps,Major-General Hancock commanding, carried a salient of his line,capturing most of Johnson's division of Ewell's corps and twenty piecesof artillery.  But the resistance was so obstinate that the advantagegained did not prove decisive.  The 13th, 14th, 15th, 16th, 17th, and18th, were consumed in manoeuvring and awaiting the arrival ofreinforcements from Washington.  Deeming it impracticable to make anyfurther attack upon the enemy at Spottsylvania Court House, orders wereissued on the 15th with a view to a movement to the North Anna, tocommence at twelve o'clock on the night of the 19th.  Late in theafternoon of the 19th, Ewell's corps came out of its works on ourextreme right flank; but the attack was promptly repulsed, with heavyloss. This delayed the movement to the North Anna until the night of the21st, when it was commenced.  But the enemy again, having the shorterline, and being in possession of the main roads, was enabled to reachthe North Anna in advance of us, and took position behind it.  The fifthcorps reached the North Anna on the afternoon of the 23d, closelyfollowed by the sixth corps. The second and ninth corps got up about thesame time, the second holding the railroad bridge, and the ninth lyingbetween that and Jericho Ford.  General Warren effected a crossing thesame afternoon, and got a position without much opposition. Soon aftergetting into position he was violently attacked, but repulsed the enemywith great slaughter.  On the 25th, General Sheridan rejoined the Armyof the Potomac from the raid on which he started from Spottsylvania,having destroyed the depots at Beaver Dam and Ashland stations, fourtrains of cars, large supplies of rations, and many miles ofrailroad-track; recaptured about four hundred of our men on their way toRichmond as prisoners of war; met and defeated the enemy's cavalry atYellow Tavern; carried the first line of works around Richmond (butfinding the second line too strong to be carried by assault), recrossedto the north bank of the Chickahominy at Meadow Bridge under heavy fire,and moved by a detour to Haxall's Landing, on the James River, where hecommunicated with General Butler.  This raid had the effect of drawingoff the whole of the enemy's cavalry force, making it comparatively easyto guard our trains.General Butler moved his main force up the James River, in pursuance ofinstructions, on the 4th of May, General Gillmore having joined him withthe tenth corps.  At the same time he sent a force of one thousand eighthundred cavalry, by way of West Point, to form a junction with himwherever he might get a foothold, and a force of three thousand cavalry,under General Kautz, from Suffolk, to operate against the road south ofPetersburg and Richmond.  On the 5th, he occupied, without opposition,both City Point and Bermuda Hundred, his movement being a completesurprise.  On the 6th, he was in position with his main army, andcommenced intrenching.  On the 7th he made a reconnoissance against thePetersburg and Richmond Railroad, destroying a portion of it after somefighting.  On the 9th he telegraphed as follows:'HEADQUARTERS, NEAR BERMUDA LANDING, May 9, 1864.'HON. E. M. STANTON, Secretary of War.'Our operations may be summed up in a few words.  With one thousandseven hundred cavalry we have advanced up the Peninsula, forced theChickahominy, and have safely, brought them to their present position.These were colored cavalry, and are now holding our advance picketstowards Richmond.'General Kautz, with three thousand cavalry from Suffolk, on the sameday with our movement up James River, forced the Black Water, burned therailroad bridge at Stony Creek, below Petersburg, cutting intoBeauregard's force at that point.'We have landed here, intrenched ourselves, destroyed many miles ofrailroad, and got a position which, with proper supplies, we can holdout against the whole of Lee's army.  I have ordered up the supplies.'Beauregard, with a large portion of his force, was left south by thecutting of the railroads by Kautz.  That portion which reachedPetersburg under Hill I have whipped to-day, killing and wounding many,and taking many prisoners, after a severe and well-contested fight.'General Grant will not be troubled with any further reinforcements toLee from Beauregard's force.'BENJ. F. BUTLER, Major-General.'On the evening of the 13th and morning of the 14th he carried a portionof the enemy's first line of defences at Drury's Bluff, or Fort Darling,with small loss.  The time thus consumed from the 6th lost to us thebenefit of the surprise and capture of Richmond and Petersburg,enabling, as it did, Beauregard to collect his loose forces in North andSouth Carolina, and bring them to the defence of those places.  On the16th, the enemy attacked General Butler in his position in front ofDrury's Bluff.  He was forced back, or drew back, into his intrenchmentsbetween the forks of the James and Appomattox rivers, the enemyintrenching strongly in his front, thus covering his railroads, thecity, and all that was valuable to him.  His army, therefore, though ina position of great security, was as completely shut off from furtheroperations directly against Richmond as if it had been in a bottlestrongly corked.  It required but a comparatively small force of theenemy to hold it there.On the 12th, General Kautz, with his cavalry, was started on a raidagainst the Danville Railroad, which he struck at Coalfield, Powhatan,and Chula Stations, destroying them, the railroad-track, two freighttrains, and one locomotive, together with large quantities of commissaryand other stores; thence, crossing to the South Side Road, struck it atWilson's, Wellsville, and Black's and White's Stations, destroying theroad and station-houses; thence he proceeded to City Point, which hereached on the 18th.On the 19th of April, and prior to the movement of General Butler, theenemy, with a land force under General Hoke and an iron-clad ram,attacked Plymouth, N. C., commanded by General H. W. Wessells, and ourgunboats there, and, after severe fighting, the place was carried byassault, and the entire garrison and armament captured.  The gunboatSmithfield was sunk, and the Miami disabled.The army sent to operate against Richmond having hermetically sealeditself up at Bermuda Hundred, the enemy was enabled to bring the most,if not all, the reinforcements brought from the south by Beauregardagainst the Army of the Potomac. In addition to this reinforcement, avery considerable one, probably not less than fifteen thousand men, wasobtained by calling in the scattered troops under Breckinridge from thewestern part of Virginia.The position of Bermuda Hundred was as easy to defend as it wasdifficult to operate from against the enemy.  I determined, therefore,to bring from it all available forces, leaving enough only to securewhat had been gained; and accordingly, on the 22d, I directed that theybe sent forward, under command of Major-General W. F. Smith, to join theArmy of the Potomac.On the 24th of May, the 9th army corps, commanded by Major-General A. E.Burnside, was assigned to the Army of the Potomac, and from this timeforward constituted a portion of Major-General Meade's command.Finding the enemy's position on the North Anna stronger than either ofhis previous ones, I withdrew on the night of the 26th to the north bankof the North Anna, and moved via Hanover Town to turn the enemy'sposition by his right.Generals Torbert's and Merritt's divisions of cavalry, under Sheridan,and the 6th corps, led the advance, crossed the Pamunkey River atHanover Town, after considerable fighting, and on the 28th the twodivisions of cavalry had a severe, but successful engagement with theenemy at Hawes's Shop.  On the 29th and 30th we advanced, with heavyskirmishing, to the Hanover Court House and Cold Harbor Road, anddeveloped the enemy's position north of the Chickahominy.  Late on theevening of the last day the enemy came out and attacked our left, butwas repulsed with very considerable loss.  An attack was immediatelyordered by General Meade, along his whole line, which resulted indriving the enemy from a part of his intrenched skirmish line.On the 31st, General Wilson's division of cavalry destroyed the railroadbridges over the South Anna River, after defeating the enemy's cavalry.General Sheridan, on the same day, reached Cold Harbor, and held ituntil relieved by the 6th corps and General Smith's command, which hadjust arrived, via White House, from General Butler's army.On the 1st day of June an attack was made at five P.M. by the 6th corpsand the troops under General Smith, the other corps being held inreadiness to advance on the receipt of orders. This resulted in ourcarrying and holding the enemy's first line of works in front of theright of the 6th corps, and in front of General Smith.  During theattack the enemy made repeated assaults on each of the corps not engagedin the main attack, but was repulsed with heavy loss in every instance.That night he made several assaults to regain what he had lost in theday, but failed.  The 2d was spent in getting troops into position foran attack on the 3d.  On the 3d of June we again assaulted the enemy'sworks, in the hope of driving him from his position.  In this attemptour loss was heavy, while that of the enemy, I have reason to believe,was comparatively light.  It was the only general attack made from theRapidan to the James which did not inflict upon the enemy losses tocompensate for our own losses.  I would not be understood as saying thatall previous attacks resulted in victories to our arms, or accomplishedas much as I had hoped from them; but they inflicted upon the enemysevere losses, which tended, in the end, to the complete overthrow ofthe rebellion.From the proximity of the enemy to his defences around Richmond, it wasimpossible, by any flank movement, to interpose between him and thecity.  I was still in a condition to either move by his left flank, andinvest Richmond from the north side, or continue my move by his rightflank to the south side of the James.  While the former might have beenbetter as a covering for Washington, yet a full survey of all the groundsatisfied me that it would be impracticable to hold a line north andeast of Richmond that would protect the Fredericksburg Railroad, a long,vulnerable line, which would exhaust much of our strength to guard, andthat would have to be protected to supply the army, and would leave opento the enemy all his lines of communication on the south side of theJames.  My idea, from the start, had been to beat Lee's army north ofRichmond, if possible.  Then, after destroying his lines ofcommunication north of the James River, to transfer the army to thesouth side, and besiege Lee in Richmond, or follow him south if heshould retreat.  After the battle of the Wilderness, it was evident thatthe enemy deemed it of the first importance to run no risks with thearmy he then had.  He acted purely on the defensive, behind breastworks,or feebly on the offensive immediately in front of them, and where, incase of repulse, he could easily retire behind them.  Without a greatersacrifice of life than I was willing to make, all could not beaccomplished that I had designed north of Richmond.  I thereforedetermined to continue to hold substantially the ground we thenoccupied, taking advantage of any favorable circumstances that mightpresent themselves, until the cavalry could be sent to Charlottesvilleand Gordonsville to effectually break up the railroad connection betweenRichmond and the Shenandoah Valley and Lynchburg; and when the cavalrygot well off, to move the army to the south side of the James River, bythe enemy's right flank, where I felt I could cut off all his sources ofsupply, except by the canal.On the 7th, two divisions of cavalry, under General Sheridan, got off onthe expedition against the Virginia Central Railroad, with instructionsto Hunter, whom I hoped he would meet near Charlottesville, to join hisforces to Sheridan's, and after the work laid out for them wasthoroughly done, to join the Army of the Potomac by the route laid downin Sheridan's instructions.On the 10th of June, General Butler sent a force of infantry, underGeneral Gillmore, and of cavalry under General Kautz, to capturePetersburg, if possible, and destroy the railroad and common bridgesacross the Appomattox.  The cavalry carried the works on the south side,and penetrated well in towards the town, but were forced to retire.General Gillmore, finding the works which he approached very strong, anddeeming an assault impracticable, returned to Bermuda Hundred withoutattempting one.Attaching great importance to the possession of Petersburg, I sent backto Bermuda Hundred and City Point, General Smith's command by water, viathe White House, to reach there in advance of the Army of the Potomac.This was for the express purpose of securing Petersburg before theenemy, becoming aware of our intention, could reinforce the place.The movement from Cold Harbor commenced after dark on the evening of the12th.  One division of cavalry, under General Wilson, and the 5th corps,crossed the Chickahominy at Long Bridge, and moved out to White OakSwamp, to cover the crossings of the other corps.  The advance corpsreached James River, at Wilcox's Landing and Charles City Court House,on the night of the 13th.During three long years the Armies of the Potomac and Northern Virginiahad been confronting each other.  In that time they had fought moredesperate battles than it probably ever before fell to the lot of twoarmies to fight, without materially changing the vantage ground ofeither.  The Southern press and people, with more shrewdness than wasdisplayed in the North, finding that they had failed to captureWashington and march on to New York, as they had boasted they would do,assumed that they only defended their Capital and Southern territory.Hence, Antietam, Gettysburg, and all the other battles that had beenfought, were by them set down as failures on our part, and victories forthem.  Their army believed this.  It produced a morale which could onlybe overcome by desperate and continuous hard fighting.  The battles ofthe Wilderness, Spottsylvania, North Anna and Cold Harbor, bloody andterrible as they were on our side, were even more damaging to the enemy,and so crippled him as to make him wary ever after of taking theoffensive.  His losses in men were probably not so great, owing to thefact that we were, save in the Wilderness, almost invariably theattacking party; and when he did attack, it was in the open field.  Thedetails of these battles, which for endurance and bravery on the part ofthe soldiery, have rarely been surpassed, are given in the report ofMajor-General Meade, and the subordinate reports accompanying it.During the campaign of forty-three days, from the Rapidan to the JamesRiver, the army had to be supplied from an ever-shifting base, bywagons, over narrow roads, through a densely wooded country, with a lackof wharves at each new base from which to conveniently dischargevessels.  Too much credit cannot, therefore, be awarded to thequartermaster and commissary departments for the zeal and efficiencydisplayed by them. Under the general supervision of the chiefquartermaster, Brigadier-General R. Ingalls, the trains were made tooccupy all the available roads between the army and our water-base, andbut little difficulty was experienced in protecting them.The movement in the Kanawha and Shenandoah valleys, under General Sigel,commenced on the 1st of May.  General Crook, who had the immediatecommand of the Kanawha expedition, divided his forces into two columns,giving one, composed of cavalry, to General Averell.  They crossed themountains by separate routes. Averell struck the Tennessee and VirginiaRailroad, near Wytheville, on the 10th, and proceeding to New River andChristiansburg, destroyed the road, several important bridges anddepots, including New River Bridge, forming a junction with Crook atUnion on the 15th.  General Sigel moved up the Shenandoah Valley, metthe enemy at New Market on the 15th, and, after a severe engagement, wasdefeated with heavy loss, and retired behind Cedar Creek.  Not regardingthe operations of General Sigel as satisfactory, I asked his removalfrom command, and Major-General Hunter appointed to supersede him.  Hisinstructions were embraced in the following dispatches to Major-GeneralH. W. Halleck, chief of staff of the army:'NEAR SPOTTSYLVANIA COURT HOUSE, VA. 'May 20, 1864.*        *        *        *        *        *        * 'The enemy areevidently relying for supplies greatly on such as are brought over thebranch road running through Staunton.  On the whole, therefore, I thinkit would be better for General Hunter to move in that direction; reachStaunton and Gordonsville or Charlottesville, if he does not meet toomuch opposition.  If he can hold at bay a force equal to his own, hewill be doing good service.  * * *'U. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General.'MAJOR-GENERAL H. W. HALLECK.''JERICHO FORD, VA., May 25, 1864.'If Hunter can possibly get to Charlottesville and Lynchburg, he shoulddo so, living on the country.  The railroads and canal should bedestroyed beyond possibility of repairs for weeks. Completing this, hecould find his way back to his original base, or from about Gordonsvillejoin this army.'U. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General.'MAJOR-GENERAL H. W. HALLECK.'General Hunter immediately took up the offensive, and, moving up theShenandoah Valley, met the enemy on the 5th of June at Piedmont, and,after a battle of ten hours, routed and defeated him, capturing on thefield of battle one thousand five hundred men, three pieces ofartillery, and three hundred stand of small arms.  On the 8th of thesame month he formed a junction with Crook and Averell at Staunton, fromwhich place he moved direct on Lynchburg, via Lexington, which place hereached and invested on the 16th day of June.  Up to this time he wasvery successful; and but for the difficulty of taking with himsufficient ordnance stores over so long a march, through a hostilecountry, he would, no doubt, have captured that, to the enemy important,point.  The destruction of the enemy's supplies and manufactories wasvery great.  To meet this movement under General Hunter, General Leesent a force, perhaps equal to a corps, a part of which reachedLynchburg a short time before Hunter.  After some skirmishing on the17th and 18th, General Hunter, owing to a want of ammunition to givebattle, retired from before the place.  Unfortunately, this want ofammunition left him no choice of route for his return but by way ofKanawha. This lost to us the use of his troops for several weeks fromthe defence of the North.Had General Hunter moved by way of Charlottesville, instead ofLexington, as his instructions contemplated, he would have been in aposition to have covered the Shenandoah Valley against the enemy, shouldthe force he met have seemed to endanger it.  If it did not, he wouldhave been within easy distance of the James River Canal, on the mainline of communication between Lynchburg and the force sent for itsdefence.  I have never taken exception to the operations of GeneralHunter, and am not now disposed to find fault with him, for I have nodoubt he acted within what he conceived to be the spirit of hisinstructions and the interests of the service.  The promptitude of hismovements and his gallantry should entitle him to the commendation ofhis country.To return to the Army of the Potomac:  The 2d corps commenced crossingthe James River on the morning of the 14th by ferry-boats at Wilcox'sLanding.  The laying of the pontoon-bridge was completed about midnightof the 14th, and the crossing of the balance of the army was rapidlypushed forward by both bridge and ferry.After the crossing had commenced, I proceeded by steamer to BermudaHundred to give the necessary orders for the immediate capture ofPetersburg.The instructions to General Butler were verbal, and were for him to sendGeneral Smith immediately, that night, with all the troops he could givehim without sacrificing the position he then held.  I told him that Iwould return at once to the Army of the Potomac, hasten its crossing andthrow it forward to Petersburg by divisions as rapidly as it could bedone, that we could reinforce our armies more rapidly there than theenemy could bring troops against us.  General Smith got off as directed,and confronted the enemy's pickets near Petersburg before daylight nextmorning, but for some reason that I have never been able tosatisfactorily understand, did not get ready to assault his main linesuntil near sundown.  Then, with a part of his command only, he made theassault, and carried the lines north-east of Petersburg from theAppomattox River, for a distance of over two and a half miles, capturingfifteen pieces of artillery and three hundred prisoners.  This was aboutseven P.M. Between the line thus captured and Petersburg there were noother works, and there was no evidence that the enemy had reinforcedPetersburg with a single brigade from any source. The night was clearthe moon shining brightly and favorable to further operations.  GeneralHancock, with two divisions of the 2d corps, reached General Smith justafter dark, and offered the service of these troops as he (Smith) mightwish, waiving rank to the named commander, who he naturally supposedknew best the position of affairs, and what to do with the troops.  Butinstead of taking these troops and pushing at once into Petersburg, herequested General Hancock to relieve a part of his line in the capturedworks, which was done before midnight.By the time I arrived the next morning the enemy was in force. An attackwas ordered to be made at six o'clock that evening by the troops underSmith and the 2d and 9th corps.  It required until that time for the 9thcorps to get up and into position. The attack was made as ordered, andthe fighting continued with but little intermission until six o'clockthe next morning, and resulted in our carrying the advance and some ofthe main works of the enemy to the right (our left) of those previouslycaptured by General Smith, several pieces of artillery, and over fourhundred prisoners.The 5th corps having got up, the attacks were renewed and persisted inwith great vigor on the 17th and 18th, but only resulted in forcing theenemy into an interior line, from which he could not be dislodged.  Theadvantages of position gained by us were very great.  The army thenproceeded to envelop Petersburg towards the South Side Railroad as faras possible without attacking fortifications.On the 16th the enemy, to reinforce Petersburg, withdrew from a part ofhis intrenchment in front of Bermuda Hundred, expecting, no doubt, toget troops from north of the James to take the place of those withdrawnbefore we could discover it.  General Butler, taking advantage of this,at once moved a force on the railroad between Petersburg and Richmond.As soon as I was apprised of the advantage thus gained, to retain it Iordered two divisions of the 6th corps, General Wright commanding, thatwere embarking at Wilcox's Landing, under orders for City Point, toreport to General Butler at Bermuda Hundred, of which General Butler wasnotified, and the importance of holding a position in advance of hispresent line urged upon him.About two o'clock in the afternoon General Butler was forced back to theline the enemy had withdrawn from in the morning. General Wright, withhis two divisions, joined General Butler on the forenoon of the 17th,the latter still holding with a strong picket-line the enemy's works.But instead of putting these divisions into the enemy's works to holdthem, he permitted them to halt and rest some distance in the rear ofhis own line. Between four and five o'clock in the afternoon the enemyattacked and drove in his pickets and re-occupied his old line.On the night of the 20th and morning of the 21st a lodgment was effectedby General Butler, with one brigade of infantry, on the north bank ofthe James, at Deep Bottom, and connected by pontoon-bridge with BermudaHundred.On the 19th, General Sheridan, on his return from his expedition againstthe Virginia Central Railroad, arrived at the White House just as theenemy's cavalry was about to attack it, and compelled it to retire.  Theresult of this expedition was, that General Sheridan met the enemy'scavalry near Trevilian Station, on the morning of the 11th of June, whomhe attacked, and after an obstinate contest drove from the field incomplete rout.  He left his dead and nearly all his wounded in ourhands, and about four hundred prisoners and several hundred horses.  Onthe 12th he destroyed the railroad from Trevilian Station to LouisaCourt House.  This occupied until three o'clock P.M., when he advancedin the direction of Gordonsville.  He found the enemy reinforced byinfantry, behind well-constructed rifle-pits, about five miles from thelatter place and too strong to successfully assault.  On the extremeright, however, his reserve brigade carried the enemy's works twice, andwas twice driven therefrom by infantry.  Night closed the contest.  Nothaving sufficient ammunition to continue the engagement, and his animalsbeing without forage (the country furnishing but inferior grazing), andhearing nothing from General Hunter, he withdrew his command to thenorth side of the North Anna, and commenced his return march, reachingWhite House at the time before stated.  After breaking up the depot atthat place, he moved to the James River, which he reached safely afterheavy fighting.  He commenced crossing on the 25th, near Fort Powhatan,without further molestation, and rejoined the Army of the Potomac.On the 22d, General Wilson, with his own division of cavalry of the Armyof the Potomac, and General Kautz's division of cavalry of the Army ofthe James moved against the enemy's railroads south of Richmond.Striking the Weldon Railroad at Reams's Station, destroying the depotand several miles of the road, and the South Side road about fifteenmiles from Petersburg, to near Nottoway Station, where he met anddefeated a force of the enemy's cavalry.  He reached Burkesville Stationon the afternoon of the 23d, and from there destroyed the DanvilleRailroad to Roanoke Bridge, a distance of twenty-five miles, where hefound the enemy in force, and in a position from which he could notdislodge him.  He then commenced his return march, and on the 28th metthe enemy's cavalry in force at the Weldon Railroad crossing of StonyCreek, where he had a severe but not decisive engagement.  Thence hemade a detour from his left with a view of reaching Reams's Station(supposing it to be in our possession).  At this place he was met by theenemy's cavalry, supported by infantry, and forced to retire, with theloss of his artillery and trains.  In this last encounter, GeneralKautz, with a part of his command, became separated, and made his wayinto our lines.  General Wilson, with the remainder of his force,succeeded in crossing the Nottoway River and coming in safely on ourleft and rear.  The damage to the enemy in this expedition more thancompensated for the losses we sustained.  It severed all connection byrailroad with Richmond for several weeks.With a view of cutting the enemy's railroad from near Richmond to theAnna rivers, and making him wary of the situation of his army in theShenandoah, and, in the event of failure in this, to take advantage ofhis necessary withdrawal of troops from Petersburg, to explode a minethat had been prepared in front of the 9th corps and assault the enemy'slines at that place, on the night of the 26th of July the 2d corps andtwo divisions of the cavalry corps and Kautz's cavalry were crossed tothe north bank of the James River and joined the force General Butlerhad there.  On the 27th the enemy was driven from his intrenchedposition, with the loss of four pieces of artillery.  On the 28th ourlines were extended from Deep Bottom to New Market Road, but in gettingthis position were attacked by the enemy in heavy force.  The fightinglasted for several hours, resulting in considerable loss to both sides.The first object of this move having failed, by reason of the very largeforce thrown there by the enemy, I determined to take advantage of thediversion made, by assaulting Petersburg before he could get his forceback there.  One division of the 2d corps was withdrawn on the night ofthe 28th, and moved during the night to the rear of the 18th corps, torelieve that corps in the line, that it might be foot-loose in theassault to be made.  The other two divisions of the 2d corps andSheridan's cavalry were crossed over on the night of the 29th and movedin front of Petersburg.  On the morning of the 30th, between four andfive o'clock, the mine was sprung, blowing up a battery and most of aregiment, and the advance of the assaulting column, formed of the 9thcorps, immediately took possession of the crater made by the explosion,and the line for some distance to the right and left of it, and adetached line in front of it, but for some cause failed to advancepromptly to the ridge beyond.  Had they done this, I have every reasonto believe that Petersburg would have fallen.  Other troops wereimmediately pushed forward, but the time consumed in getting them upenabled the enemy to rally from his surprise (which had been complete),and get forces to this point for its defence.  The captured line thusheld being untenable, and of no advantage to us, the troops werewithdrawn, but not without heavy loss.  Thus terminated in disaster whatpromised to be the most successful assault of the campaign.Immediately upon the enemy's ascertaining that General Hunter wasretreating from Lynchburg by way of the Kanawha River, thus laying theShenandoah Valley open for raid into Maryland and Pennsylvania, hereturned northward and moved down that valley.  As soon as this movementof the enemy was ascertained, General Hunter, who had reached theKanawha River, was directed to move his troops without delay, by riverand railroad, to Harper's Ferry; but owing to the difficulty ofnavigation by reason of low water and breaks in the railroad, greatdelay was experienced in getting there.  It became necessary, therefore,to find other troops to check this movement of the enemy.  For thispurpose the 6th corps was taken from the armies operating againstRichmond, to which was added the 19th corps, then fortunately beginningto arrive in Hampton Roads from the Gulf Department, under orders issuedimmediately after the ascertainment of the result of the Red Riverexpedition.  The garrisons of Baltimore and Washington were at this timemade up of heavy-artillery regiments, hundred days' men, and detachmentsfrom the invalid corps.  One division under command of General Ricketts,of the 6th corps, was sent to Baltimore, and the remaining two divisionsof the 6th corps, under General Wright, were subsequently sent toWashington.  On the 3d of July the enemy approached Martinsburg.General Sigel, who was in command of our forces there, retreated acrossthe Potomac at Shepherdtown; and General Weber, commanding at Harper'sFerry, crossed the occupied Hagerstown, moving a strong column towardsFrederick City.  General Wallace, with Rickett's division and his owncommand, the latter mostly new and undisciplined troops, pushed out fromBaltimore with great promptness, and met the enemy in force on theMonocacy, near the crossing of the railroad bridge.  His force was notsufficient to insure success, but he fought the enemy nevertheless, andalthough it resulted in a defeat to our arms, yet it detained the enemy,and thereby served to enable General Wright to reach Washington with twodivision of the 6th corps, and the advance of the 19th corps, beforehim.  From Monocacy the enemy moved on Washington, his cavalry advancereaching Rockville on the evening of the 10th.  On the 12th areconnoissance was thrown out in front of Fort Stevens, to ascertain theenemy's position and force.  A severe skirmish ensued, in which we lostabout two hundred and eighty in killed and wounded.  The enemy's losswas probably greater.  He commenced retreating during the night.Learning the exact condition of affairs at Washington, I requested bytelegraph, at forty-five minutes past eleven P.M., on the 12th, theassignment of Major-General H. G. Wright to the command of all thetroops that could be made available to operate in the field against theenemy, and directed that he should get outside of the trenches with allthe force he could, and push Early to the last moment.  General Wrightcommenced the pursuit on the 13th; on the 18th the enemy was overtakenat Snicker's Ferry, on the Shenandoah, when a sharp skirmish occurred;and on the 20th, General Averell encountered and defeated a portion ofthe rebel army at Winchester, capturing four pieces of artillery andseveral hundred prisoners.Learning that Early was retreating south towards Lynchburg or Richmond,I directed that the 6th and 19th corps be got back to the armiesoperating against Richmond, so that they might be used in a movementagainst Lee before the return of the troops sent by him into the valley;and that Hunter should remain in the Shenandoah Valley, keeping betweenany force of the enemy and Washington, acting on the defensive as muchas possible.  I felt that if the enemy had any notion of returning, thefact would be developed before the 6th and 19th corps could leaveWashington.  Subsequently, the 19th corps was excepted form the order toreturn to the James.About the 25th it became evident that the enemy was again advancing uponMaryland and Pennsylvania, and the 6th corps, then at Washington, wasordered back to the vicinity of Harper's Ferry.  The rebel force moveddown the valley, and sent a raiding party into Pennsylvania which on the30th burned Chambersburg, and then retreated, pursued by our cavalry,towards Cumberland.  They were met and defeated by General Kelley, andwith diminished numbers escaped into the mountains of West Virginia.From the time of the first raid the telegraph wires were frequently downbetween Washington and City Point, making it necessary to transmitmessages a part of the way by boat.  It took from twenty-four tothirty-six hours to get dispatches through and return answers would bereceived showing a different state of facts from those on which theywere based, causing confusion and apparent contradiction of orders thatmust have considerably embarrassed those who had to execute them, andrendered operations against the enemy less effective than they otherwisewould have been. To remedy this evil, it was evident to my mind thatsome person should have the supreme command of all the forces in theDepartment of West Virginia, Washington, Susquehanna, and the MiddleDepartment, and I so recommended.On the 2d of August, I ordered General Sheridan to report in person toMajor-General Halleck, chief of staff, at Washington, with a view to hisassignment to the command of all the forces against Early.  At this timethe enemy was concentrated in the neighborhood of Winchester, while ourforces, under General Hunter, were concentrated on the Monocacy, at thecrossing of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, leaving open to the enemyWestern Maryland and Southern Pennsylvania.  From where I was, Ihesitated to give positive orders for the movement of our forces atMonocacy, lest by so doing I should expose Washington. Therefore, on the4th, I left City Point to visit Hunter's command, and determine formyself what was best to be done.  On arrival there, and afterconsultation with General Hunter, I issued to him the followinginstructions:'MONOCACY BRIDGE, MARYLAND, August 5, 1864--8 P.M.'GENERAL:--Concentrate all your available force without delay in thevicinity of Harper's Ferry, leaving only such railroad guards andgarrisons for public property as may be necessary.  Use, in thisconcentrating, the railroad, if by so doing time can be saved.  FromHarper's Ferry, if it is found that the enemy has moved north of thePotomac in large force, push north, following him and attacking himwherever found; follow him, if driven south of the Potomac, as long asit is safe to do so.  If it is ascertained that the enemy has but asmall force north of the Potomac, then push south with the main force,detaching under a competent commander, a sufficient force to look afterthe raiders, and drive them to their homes.  In detaching such a force,the brigade of the cavalry now en route from Washington via Rockvillemay be taken into account.'There are now on their way to join you three other brigades of the bestcavalry, numbering at least five thousand men and horses.  These will beinstructed, in the absence of further orders, to join you by the southside of the Potomac.  One brigade will probably start to-morrow.  Inpushing up the Shenandoah Valley, where it is expected you will have togo first or last, it is desirable that nothing should be left to invitethe enemy to return.  Take all provisions, forage, and stock wanted forthe use of your command; such as cannot be consumed, destroy.  It is notdesirable that the buildings should be destroyed--they should rather beprotected; but the people should be informed that, so long as an armycan subsist among them, recurrence of theses raids must be expected, andwe are determined to stop them at all hazards.'Bear in mind, the object is to drive the enemy south; and to do thisyou want to keep him always in sight.  Be guided in your course by thecourse he takes.'Make your own arrangements for supplies of all kinds, giving regularvouchers for such as may be taken from loyal citizens in the countrythrough which you march.'U. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General.'MAJOR-GENERAL D. HUNTER.'The troops were immediately put in motion, and the advance reachedHalltown that night.General Hunter having, in our conversation, expressed a willingness tobe relieved from command, I telegraphed to have General Sheridan, thenat Washington, sent to Harper's Ferry by the morning train, with ordersto take general command of all the troops in the field, and to call onGeneral Hunter at Monocacy, who would turn over to him my letter ofinstructions.  I remained at Monocacy until General Sheridan arrived, onthe morning of the 6th, and, after a conference with him in relation tomilitary affairs in that vicinity, I returned to City Point by way ofWashington.On the 7th of August, the Middle Department, and the Departments of WestVirginia, Washington, and Susquehanna, were constituted into the 'MiddleMilitary Division,' and  Major-General Sheridan was assigned totemporary command of the same.Two divisions of cavalry, commanded by Generals Torbert and Wilson, weresent to Sheridan from the Army of the Potomac. The first reached him atHarper's Ferry about the 11th of August.His operations during the month of August and the fore part of Septemberwere both of an offensive and defensive character, resulting in manysevere skirmishes, principally by the cavalry, in which we weregenerally successful, but no general engagement took place.  The twoarmies lay in such a position--the enemy on the west bank of the OpequonCreek covering Winchester, and our forces in front of Berryville--thateither could bring on a battle at any time.  Defeat to us would lay opento the enemy the States of Maryland and Pennsylvania for long distancesbefore another army could be interposed to check him.  Under thesecircumstances I hesitated about allowing the initiative to be taken.Finally, the use of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, and the Chesapeakeand Ohio Canal, which were both obstructed by the enemy, became soindispensably necessary to us, and the importance of relievingPennsylvania and Maryland from continuously threatened invasion sogreat, that I determined the risk should be taken.  But fearing totelegraph the order for an attack without knowing more than I did ofGeneral Sheridan's feelings as to what would be the probable result, Ileft City Point on the 15th of September to visit him at hisheadquarters, to decide, after conference with him, what should be done.I met him at Charlestown, and he pointed out so distinctly how each armylay; what he could do the moment he was authorized, and expressed suchconfidence of success, that I saw there were but two words ofinstructions necessary--Go in!  For the conveniences of forage, theteams for supplying the army were kept at Harper's Ferry.  I asked himif he could get out his teams and supplies in time to make an attack onthe ensuing Tuesday morning.  His reply was, that he could beforedaylight on Monday.  He was off promptly to time, and I may here add,that the result was such that I have never since deemed it necessary tovisit General Sheridan before giving him orders.Early on the morning of the 19th, General Sheridan attacked GeneralEarly at the crossing on the Opequon Creek, and after a most sanguinaryand bloody battle, lasting until five o'clock in the evening, defeatedhim with heavy loss, carrying his entire position from Opequon Creek toWinchester, capturing several thousand prisoners and five pieces ofartillery.  The enemy rallied, and made a stand in a strong position atFisher's Hill, where he was attacked, and again defeated with heavy losson the 20th [22d].  Sheridan pursued him with great energy throughHarrisonburg, Staunton, and the gaps of the Blue Ridge.  After strippingthe upper valley of most of the supplies and provisions for the rebelarmy, he returned to Strasburg, and took position on the north side ofCedar Creek.Having received considerable reinforcements, General Early againreturned to the valley, and, on the 9th of October, his cavalryencountered ours near Strasburg, where the rebels were defeated, withthe loss of eleven pieces of artillery and three hundred and fiftyprisoners.  On the night of the 18th, the enemy crossed the mountainswhich separate the branches of the Shenandoah, forded the North Fork,and early on the morning of the 19th, under cover of the darkness andthe fog, surprised and turned our left flank, and captured the batterieswhich enfiladed our whole line.  Our troops fell back with heavy lossand in much confusion, but were finally rallied between Middletown andNewtown.  At this juncture, General Sheridan, who was at Winchester whenthe battle commenced arrived on the field, arranged his lines just intime to repulse a heavy attack of the enemy, and immediately assumingthe offensive, he attacked in turn with great vigor.  The enemy wasdefeated with great slaughter, and the loss of most of his artillery andtrains, and the trophies he had captured in the morning.  The wreck ofhis army escaped during the night, and fled in the direction of Stauntonand Lynchburg.  Pursuit was made to Mount Jackson. Thus ended this, theenemy's last attempt to invade the North via the Shenandoah Valley.  Iwas now enabled to return the 6th corps to the Army of the Potomac, andto send one division from Sheridan's army to the Army of the James, andanother to Savannah, Georgia, to hold Sherman's new acquisitions on thesea-coast, and thus enable him to move without detaching from his forcefor that purpose.Reports from various sources led me to believe that the enemy haddetached three divisions from Petersburg to reinforce Early in theShenandoah Valley.  I therefore sent the 2d corps and Gregg's divisionof cavalry, of the Army of the Potomac, and a force of General Butler'sarmy, on the night of the 13th of August, to threaten Richmond from thenorth side of the James, to prevent him from sending troops away, and,if possible, to draw back those sent.  In this move we captured sixpieces of artillery and several hundred prisoners, detained troops thatwere under marching orders, and ascertained that but one division(Kershaw's), of the three reputed detached, had gone.The enemy having withdrawn heavily from Petersburg to resist thismovement, the 5th corps, General Warren commanding, was moved out on the18th, and took possession of the Weldon Railroad.  During the day he hadconsiderable fighting.  To regain possession of the road, the enemy maderepeated and desperate assaults, but was each time repulsed with greatloss.  On the night of the 20th, the troops on the north side of theJames were withdrawn, and Hancock and Gregg returned to the front atPetersburg.  On the 25th, the 2d corps and Gregg's division of cavalry,while at Reams's Station destroying the railroad, were attacked, andafter desperate fighting, a part of our line gave way, and five piecesof artillery fell into the hands of the enemy.By the 12th of September, a branch railroad was completed from the CityPoint and Petersburg Railroad to the Weldon Railroad, enabling us tosupply, without difficulty, in all weather, the army in front ofPetersburg.The extension of our lines across the Weldon Railroad compelled theenemy to so extend his, that it seemed he could have but few troopsnorth of the James for the defence of Richmond.  On the night of the28th, the 10th corps, Major-General Birney, and the 18th corps,Major-General Ord commanding, of General Butler's army, were crossed tothe north side of the James, and advanced on the morning of the 29th,carrying the very strong fortifications and intrenchments belowChaffin's Farm, known as Fort Harrison, capturing fifteen pieces ofartillery, and the New Market Road and intrenchments.  This success wasfollowed up by a gallant assault upon Fort Gilmer, immediately in frontof the Chaffin Farm fortifications, in which we were repulsed with heavyloss.  Kautz's cavalry was pushed forward on the road to the right ofthis, supported by infantry, and reached the enemy's inner line, but wasunable to get further.  The position captured from the enemy was sothreatening to Richmond, that I determined to hold it.  The enemy madeseveral desperate attempts to dislodge us, all of which wereunsuccessful, and for which he paid dearly.  On the morning of the 30th,General Meade sent out a reconnoissance with a view to attacking theenemy's line, if it was found sufficiently weakened by withdrawal oftroops to the north side.  In this reconnoissance we captured and heldthe enemy's works near Poplar Spring Church.  In the afternoon, troopsmoving to get to the left of the point gained were attacked by the enemyin heavy force, and compelled to fall back until supported by the forcesholding the captured works. Our cavalry under Gregg was also attacked,but repulsed the enemy with great loss.On the 7th of October, the enemy attacked Kautz's cavalry north of theJames, and drove it back with heavy loss in killed, wounded, andprisoners, and the loss of all the artillery eight or nine pieces.  Thishe followed up by an attack on our intrenched infantry line, but wasrepulsed with severe slaughter.  On the 13th, a reconnoissance was sentout by General Butler, with a view to drive the enemy from some newworks he was constructing, which resulted in very heavy loss to us.On the 27th, the Army of the Potomac, leaving only sufficient men tohold its fortified line, moved by the enemy's right flank.  The 2dcorps, followed by two divisions of the 5th corps, with the cavalry inadvance and covering our left flank, forced a passage of Hatcher's Run,and moved up the south side of it towards the South Side Railroad, untilthe 2d corps and part of the cavalry reached the Boydton Plank Roadwhere it crosses Hatcher's Run.  At this point we were six miles distantfrom the South Side Railroad, which I had hoped by this movement toreach and hold.  But finding that we had not reached the end of theenemy's fortifications, and no place presenting itself for a successfulassault by which he might be doubled up and shortened, I determined towithdraw to within our fortified line.  Orders were given accordingly.Immediately upon receiving a report that General Warren had connectedwith General Hancock, I returned to my headquarters.  Soon after I leftthe enemy moved out across Hatcher's Run, in the gap between GeneralsHancock and Warren, which was not closed as reported, and made adesperate attack on General Hancock's right and rear.  General Hancockimmediately faced his corps to meet it, and after a bloody combat drovethe enemy within his works, and withdrew that night to his old position.In support of this movement, General Butler made a demonstration on thenorth side of the James, and attacked the enemy on the WilliamsburgRoad, and also on the York River Railroad.  In the former he wasunsuccessful; in the latter he succeeded in carrying a work which wasafterwards abandoned, and his forces withdrawn to their formerpositions.From this time forward the operations in front of Petersburg andRichmond, until the spring campaign of 1865, were confined to thedefence and extension of our lines, and to offensive movements forcrippling the enemy's lines of communication, and to prevent hisdetaching any considerable force to send south.  By the 7th of February,our lines were extended to Hatcher's Run, and the Weldon Railroad hadbeen destroyed to Hicksford.General Sherman moved from Chattanooga on the 6th of May, with theArmies of the Cumberland, Tennessee, and Ohio, commanded, respectively,by Generals Thomas McPherson, and Schofield, upon Johnston's army atDalton; but finding the enemy's position at Buzzard's Roost, coveringDalton, too strong to be assaulted, General McPherson was sent throughSnake Gap to turn it, while Generals Thomas and Schofield threatened itin front and on the north.  This movement was successful.  Johnston,finding his retreat likely to be cut off, fell back to his fortifiedposition at Resaca, where he was attacked on the afternoon of May 15th.A heavy battle ensued.  During the night the enemy retreated south.Late on the 17th, his rear-guard was overtaken near Adairsville, andheavy skirmishing followed.  The next morning, however, he had againdisappeared.  He was vigorously pursued, and was overtaken at Cassvilleon the 19th, but during the ensuing night retreated across the Etowah.While these operations were going on, General Jefferson C. Davis'sdivision of Thomas's army was sent to Rome, capturing it with its fortsand artillery, and its valuable mills and foundries.  General Sherman,having give his army a few days' rest at this point, again put it inmotion on the 23d, for Dallas, with a view of turning the difficult passat Allatoona.  On the afternoon of the 25th, the advance, under GeneralHooker, had a severe battle with the enemy, driving him back to New HopeChurch, near Dallas.  Several sharp encounters occurred at this point.The most important was on the 28th, when the enemy assaulted GeneralMcPherson at Dallas, but received a terrible and bloody repulse.On the 4th of June, Johnston abandoned his intrenched position at NewHope Church, and retreated to the strong positions of Kenesaw, Pine, andLost mountains.  He was forced to yield the two last-named places, andconcentrate his army on Kenesaw, where, on the 27th, Generals Thomas andMcPherson made a determined but unsuccessful assault.  On the night ofthe 2d of July, Sherman commenced moving his army by the right flank,and on the morning of the 3d, found that the enemy, in consequence ofthis movement, had abandoned Kenesaw and retreated across theChattahoochee.General Sherman remained on the Chattahoochee to give his men rest andget up stores until the 17th of July, when he resumed his operations,crossed the Chattahoochee, destroyed a large portion of the railroad toAugusta, and drove the enemy back to Atlanta. At this place General Hoodsucceeded General Johnston in command of the rebel army, and assumingthe offensive-defensive policy, made several severe attacks upon Shermanin the vicinity of Atlanta, the most desperate and determined of whichwas on the 22d of July.  About one P.M. of this day the brave,accomplished, and noble-hearted McPherson was killed.  General Logansucceeded him, and commanded the Army of the Tennessee through thisdesperate battle, and until he was superseded by Major-General Howard,on the 26th, with the same success and ability that had characterizedhim in the command of a corps or division.In all these attacks the enemy was repulsed with great loss. Finding itimpossible to entirely invest the place, General Sherman, after securinghis line of communications across the Chattahoochee, moved his mainforce round by the enemy's left flank upon the Montgomery and Maconroads, to draw the enemy from his fortifications.  In this he succeeded,and after defeating the enemy near Rough-and-Ready, Jonesboro, andLovejoy's, forcing him to retreat to the south, on the 2d of Septemberoccupied Atlanta, the objective point of his campaign.About the time of this move, the rebel cavalry, under Wheeler, attemptedto cut his communications in the rear, but was repulsed at Dalton, anddriven into East Tennessee, whence it proceeded west to McMinnville,Murfreesboro, and Franklin, and was finally driven south of theTennessee.  The damage done by this raid was repaired in a few days.During the partial investment of Atlanta, General Rousseau joinedGeneral Sherman with a force of cavalry from Decatur, having made asuccessful raid upon the Atlanta and Montgomery Railroad, and itsbranches near Opelika. Cavalry raids were also made by Generals McCook,Garrard, and Stoneman, to cut the remaining Railroad communication withAtlanta.  The first two were successful the latter, disastrous.General Sherman's movement from Chattanooga to Atlanta was prompt,skilful, and brilliant.  The history of his flank movements and battlesduring that memorable campaign will ever be read with an interestunsurpassed by anything in history.His own report, and those of his subordinate commanders, accompanyingit, give the details of that most successful campaign.He was dependent for the supply of his armies upon a single-trackrailroad from Nashville to the point where he was operating.  Thispassed the entire distance through a hostile country, and every foot ofit had to be protected by troops. The cavalry force of the enemy underForrest, in Northern Mississippi, was evidently waiting for Sherman toadvance far enough into the mountains of Georgia, to make a retreatdisastrous, to get upon this line and destroy it beyond the possibilityof further use.  To guard against this danger, Sherman left what hesupposed to be a sufficient force to operate against Forrest in WestTennessee.  He directed General Washburn, who commanded there, to sendBrigadier-General S. D. Sturgis in command of this force to attack him.On the morning of the 10th of June, General Sturgis met the enemy nearGuntown, Mississippi, was badly beaten, and driven back in utter routand confusion to Memphis, a distance of about one hundred miles, hotlypursued by the enemy.  By this, however, the enemy was defeated in hisdesigns upon Sherman's line of communications. The persistency withwhich he followed up this success exhausted him, and made a season forrest and repairs necessary.  In the meantime, Major-General A. J. Smith,with the troops of the Army of the Tennessee that had been sent byGeneral Sherman to General Banks, arrived at Memphis on their returnfrom Red River, where they had done most excellent service.  He wasdirected by General Sherman to immediately take the offensive againstForrest.  This he did with the promptness and effect which hascharacterized his whole military career.  On the 14th of July, he metthe enemy at Tupelo, Mississippi, and whipped him badly.  The fightingcontinued through three days.  Our loss was small compared with that ofthe enemy.  Having accomplished the object of his expedition, GeneralSmith returned to Memphis.During the months of March and April this same force under Forrestannoyed us considerably.  On the 24th of March it captured Union City,Kentucky, and its garrison, and on the 24th attacked Paducah, commandedby Colonel S. G. Hicks, 40th Illinois Volunteers.  Colonel H., havingbut a small force, withdrew to the forts near the river, from where herepulsed the enemy and drove him from the place.On the 13th of April, part of this force, under the rebel GeneralBuford, summoned the garrison of Columbus, Kentucky, to surrender, butreceived for reply from Colonel Lawrence, 34th New Jersey Volunteers,that being placed there by his Government with adequate force to holdhis post and repel all enemies from it, surrender was out of thequestion.On the morning of the same day Forrest attacked Fort Pillow, Tennessee,garrisoned by a detachment of Tennessee cavalry and the 1st RegimentAlabama colored troops, commanded by Major Booth.  The garrison foughtbravely until about three o'clock in the afternoon, when the enemycarried the works by assault; and, after our men threw down their arms,proceeded to an inhuman and merciless massacre of the garrison.On the 14th, General Buford, having failed at Columbus, appeared beforePaducah, but was again driven off.Guerillas and raiders, seemingly emboldened by Forrest's operations,were also very active in Kentucky.  The most noted of these was Morgan.With a force of from two to three thousand cavalry, he entered the Statethrough Pound Gap in the latter part of May.  On the 11th of June theyattacked and captured Cynthiana, with its entire garrison.  On the 12thhe was overtaken by General Burbridge, and completely routed with heavyloss, and was finally driven out of the State.  This notorious guerillawas afterwards surprised and killed near Greenville, Tennessee, and hiscommand captured and dispersed by General Gillem.In the absence of official reports of the commencement of the Red Riverexpedition, except so far as relates to the movements of the troops sentby General Sherman under General A. J. Smith, I am unable to give thedate of its starting.  The troops under General Smith, comprising twodivisions of the 16th and a detachment of the 17th army corps, leftVicksburg on the 10th of March, and reached the designated point on RedRiver one day earlier than that appointed by General Banks.  The rebelforces at Fort de Russy, thinking to defeat him, left the fort on the14th to give him battle in the open field; but, while occupying theenemy with skirmishing and demonstrations, Smith pushed forward to Fortde Russy, which had been left with a weak garrison, and captured it withits garrison about three hundred and fifty men, eleven pieces ofartillery, and many small-arms.  Our loss was but slight.  On the 15thhe pushed forward to Alexandria, which place he reached on the 18th.  Onthe 21st he had an engagement with the enemy at Henderson's Hill, inwhich he defeated him, capturing two hundred and ten prisoners and fourpieces of artillery.On the 28th, he again attacked and defeated the enemy under the rebelGeneral Taylor, at Cane River.  By the 26th, General Banks had assembledhis whole army at Alexandria, and pushed forward to Grand Ecore.  On themorning of April 6th he moved from Grand Ecore.  On the afternoon of the7th, he advanced and met the enemy near Pleasant Hill, and drove himfrom the field.  On the same afternoon the enemy made a stand eightmiles beyond Pleasant Hill, but was again compelled to retreat.  On the8th, at Sabine Cross Roads and Peach Hill, the enemy attacked anddefeated his advance, capturing nineteen pieces of artillery and animmense amount of transportation and stores.  During the night, GeneralBanks fell back to Pleasant Hill, where another battle was fought on the9th, and the enemy repulsed with great loss.  During the night, GeneralBanks continued his retrograde movement to Grand Ecore, and thence toAlexandria, which he reached on the 27th of April.  Here a seriousdifficulty arose in getting Admiral Porter's fleet which accompanied theexpedition, over the rapids, the water having fallen so much since theypassed up as to prevent their return.  At the suggestion of Colonel (nowBrigadier-General) Bailey, and under his superintendence, wing-dams wereconstructed, by which the channel was contracted so that the fleetpassed down the rapids in safety.The army evacuated Alexandria on the 14th of May, after considerableskirmishing with the enemy's advance, and reached Morganzia and PointCoupee near the end of the month.  The disastrous termination of thisexpedition, and the lateness of the season, rendered impracticable thecarrying out of my plans of a movement in force sufficient to insure thecapture of Mobile.On the 23d of March, Major-General Steele left Little Rock with the 7tharmy corps, to  cooperate with General Banks's expedition on the RedRiver, and reached Arkadelphia on the 28th.  On the 16th of April, afterdriving the enemy before him, he was joined, near Elkin's Ferry, inWashita County, by General Thayer, who had marched from Fort Smith.After several severe skirmishes, in which the enemy was defeated,General Steele reached Camden, which he occupied about the middle ofApril.On learning the defeat and consequent retreat of General Banks on RedRiver, and the loss of one of his own trains at Mark's Mill, in DallasCounty, General Steele determined to fall back to the Arkansas River.He left Camden on the 26th of April, and reached Little Rock on the 2dof May.  On the 30th of April, the enemy attacked him while crossingSaline River at Jenkins's Ferry, but was repulsed with considerableloss.  Our loss was about six hundred in killed, wounded and prisoners.Major-General Canby, who had been assigned to the command of the'Military Division of the West Mississippi,' was therefore directed tosend the 19th army corps to join the armies operating against Richmond,and to limit the remainder of his command to such operations as might benecessary to hold the positions and lines of communications he thenoccupied.Before starting General A. J. Smith's troops back to Sherman, GeneralCanby sent a part of it to disperse a force of the enemy that wascollecting near the Mississippi River.  General Smith met and defeatedthis force near Lake Chicot on the 5th of June.  Our loss was aboutforty killed and seventy wounded.In the latter part of July, General Canby sent Major-General GordonGranger, with such forces as he could collect, to co-operate withAdmiral Farragut against the defences of Mobile Bay.  On the 8th ofAugust, Fort Gaines surrendered to the combined naval and land forces.Fort Powell was blown up and abandoned.On the 9th, Fort Morgan was invested, and, after a severe bombardment,surrendered on the 23d.  The total captures amounted to one thousandfour hundred and sixty-four prisoners, and one hundred and four piecesof artillery.About the last of August, it being reported that the rebel GeneralPrice, with a force of about ten thousand men, had reached Jacksonport,on his way to invade Missouri, General A. J. Smith's command, then enroute from Memphis to join Sherman, was ordered to Missouri.  A cavalryforce was also, at the same time, sent from Memphis, under command ofColonel Winslow.  This made General Rosecrans's forces superior to thoseof Price, and no doubt was entertained he would be able to check Priceand drive him back; while the forces under General Steele, in Arkansas,would cut off his retreat.  On the 26th day of September, Price attackedPilot Knob and forced the garrison to retreat, and thence moved north tothe Missouri River, and continued up that river towards Kansas.  GeneralCurtis, commanding Department of Kansas, immediately collected suchforces as he could to repel the invasion of Kansas, while GeneralRosecrans's cavalry was operating in his rear.The enemy was brought to battle on the Big Blue and defeated, with theloss of nearly all his artillery and trains and a large number ofprisoners.  He made a precipitate retreat to Northern Arkansas.  Theimpunity with which Price was enabled to roam over the State of Missourifor a long time, and the incalculable mischief done by him, show to howlittle purpose a superior force may be used.  There is no reason whyGeneral Rosecrans should not have concentrated his forces, and beatenand driven Price before the latter reached Pilot Knob.September 20th, the enemy's cavalry, under Forrest, crossed theTennessee near Waterloo, Alabama, and on the 23d attacked the garrisonat Athens, consisting of six hundred men, which capitulated on the 24th.Soon after the surrender two regiments of reinforcements arrived, andafter a severe fight were compelled to surrender.  Forrest destroyed therailroad westward, captured the garrison at Sulphur Branch trestle,skirmished with the garrison at Pulaski on the 27th, and on the same daycut the Nashville and Chattanooga Railroad near Tullahoma and Dechard.On the morning of the 30th, one column of Forrest's command, underBuford, appeared before Huntsville, and summoned the surrender of thegarrison.  Receiving an answer in the negative, he remained in thevicinity of the place until next morning, when he again summoned itssurrender, and received the same reply as on the night before.  Hewithdrew in the direction of Athens which place had been regarrisoned,and attacked it on the afternoon of the 1st of October, but withoutsuccess.  On the morning of the 2d he renewed his attack, but washandsomely repulsed.Another column under Forrest appeared before Columbia on the morning ofthe 1st, but did not make an attack.  On the morning of the 3d he movedtowards Mount Pleasant.  While these operations were going on, everyexertion was made by General Thomas to destroy the forces under Forrestbefore he could recross the Tennessee, but was unable to prevent hisescape to Corinth, Mississippi.In September, an expedition under General Burbridge was sent to destroythe saltworks at Saltville, Virginia. He met the enemy on the 2d ofOctober, about three miles and a half from Saltville, and drove him intohis strongly intrenched position around the salt-works, from which hewas unable to dislodge him.  During the night he withdrew his commandand returned to Kentucky.General Sherman, immediately after the fall of Atlanta, put his armiesin camp in and about the place, and made all preparations for refittingand supplying them for future service.  The great length of road fromAtlanta to the Cumberland River, however, which had to be guarded,allowed the troops but little rest.During this time Jefferson Davis made a speech in Macon, Georgia, whichwas reported in the papers of the South, and soon became known to thewhole country, disclosing the plans of the enemy, thus enabling GeneralSherman to fully meet them.  He exhibited the weakness of supposing thatan army that had been beaten and fearfully decimated in a vain attemptat the defensive, could successfully undertake the offensive against thearmy that had so often defeated it.In execution of this plan, Hood, with this army, was soon reported tothe south-west of Atlanta. Moving far to Sherman's right, he succeededin reaching the railroad about Big Shanty, and moved north on it.General Sherman, leaving a force to hold Atlanta, with the remainder ofhis army fell upon him and drove him to Gadsden, Alabama. Seeing theconstant annoyance he would have with the roads to his rear if heattempted to hold Atlanta, General Sherman proposed the abandonment anddestruction of that place, with all the railroads leading to it, andtelegraphed me as follows:'CENTREVILLE, GEORGIA', October 10--noon.'Dispatch about Wilson just received.  Hood is now crossing Coosa River,twelve miles below Rome, bound west.  If he passes over the Mobile andOhio road, had I not better execute the plan of my letter sent byColonel Porter, and leave General Thomas with the troops now inTennessee to defend the State?  He will have an ample force when thereinforcements ordered reach Nashville.'W. T. SHERMAN, Major-General.'LIEUTENANT-GENERAL GRANT.'For a full understanding of the plan referred to in this dispatch, Iquote from the letter sent by Colonel Porter:'I will therefore give my opinion, that your army and Canby's should bereinforced to the maximum; that after you get Wilmington, you strike forSavannah and the river; that Canby be instructed to hold the MississippiRiver, and send a force to get Columbus, Georgia, either by the way ofthe Alabama or the Appalachicola, and that I keep Hood employed and putmy army in final order for a march on Augusta, Columbia, and Charleston,to be ready as soon as Wilmington is sealed as to commerce and the cityof Savannah is in our possession.'  This was in reply to a letter ofmine of date September 12th, in answer to a dispatch of his containingsubstantially the same proposition, and in which I informed him of aproposed movement against Wilmington, and of the situation in Virginia,etc.'CITY POINT, VIRGINIA,'October 11, 1864--11 A.M.'Your dispatch of October 10th received.  Does it not look as if Hoodwas going to attempt the invasion of Middle Tennessee, using the Mobileand Ohio and Memphis and Charleston roads to supply his base on theTennessee River, about Florence or Decatur?  If he does this, he oughtto be met and prevented from getting north of the Tennessee River.  Ifyou were to cut loose, I do not believe you would meet Hood's army, butwould be bushwhacked by all the old men and little boys, and suchrailroad guards as are still left at home.  Hood would probably strikefor Nashville, thinking that by going north he could inflict greaterdamage upon us than we could upon the rebels by going south.  If thereis any way of getting at Hood's army, I would prefer that, but I musttrust to your own judgment.  I find I shall not be able to send a forcefrom here to act with you on Savannah. Your movements, therefore, willbe independent of mine; at least until the fall of Richmond takes place.I am afraid Thomas, with such lines of road as he has to protect, couldnot prevent Hood from going north.  With Wilson turned loose, with allyour cavalry, you will find the rebels put much more on the defensivethan heretofore.'U. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General.'MAJOR-GENERAL W. T. SHERMAN.''KINGSTON, GEORGIA, 'October 11--11 A.M.'Hood moved his army from Palmetto Station across by Dallas andCedartown, and is now on the Coosa River, south of Rome.  He threw onecorps on my road at Acworth, and I was forced to follow.  I hold Atlantawith the 20th corps, and have strong detachments along my line.  Thisreduces my active force to a comparatively small army.  We cannot remainhere on the defensive.  With the twenty-five thousand men, and the boldcavalry he has, he can constantly break my roads.  I would infinitelyprefer to make a wreck of the road, and of the country from Chattanoogato Atlanta including the latter city send back all my wounded andworthless, and with my effective army, move through Georgia, smashingthings, to the sea. Hood may turn into Tennessee and Kentucky, but Ibelieve he will be forced to follow me.  Instead of my being on thedefensive, I would be on the offensive; instead of guessing at what hemeans to do, he would have to guess at my plans.  The difference in waris full twenty-five per cent.  I can make Savannah, Charleston, or themouth of the Chattahoochee.'Answer quick, as I know we will not have the telegraph long.'W. T. SHERMAN, Major-General.'LIEUTENANT-GENERAL GRANT.''CITY POINT, VIRGINIA, 'October 11,1864--11.30 P.M.'Your dispatch of to-day received.  If you are satisfied the trip to thesea-coast can be made, holding the line of the Tennessee River firmly,you may make it, destroying all the railroad south of Dalton orChattanooga, as you think best.'U. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General.'MAJOR-GENERAL W. T. SHERMAN.'It was the original design to hold Atlanta, and by getting through tothe coast, with a garrison left on the southern railroads, leading eastand west, through Georgia, to effectually sever the east from the west.In other words, cut the would-be Confederacy in two again, as it hadbeen cut once by our gaining possession of the Mississippi River.General Sherman's plan virtually effected this object.General Sherman commenced at once his preparations for his proposedmovement, keeping his army in position in the meantime to watch Hood.Becoming satisfied that Hood had moved westward from Gadsden across SandMountain, General Sherman sent the 4th corps,  Major-General Stanleycommanding, and the 23d corps, Major-General Schofield commanding, backto Chattanooga to report to Major-General Thomas, at Nashville, whom hehad placed in command of all the troops of his military division, savethe four army corps and cavalry division he designed to move withthrough Georgia. With the troops thus left at his disposal, there waslittle doubt that General Thomas could hold the line of the Tennessee,or, in the event Hood should force it, would be able to concentrate andbeat him in battle.  It was therefore readily consented to that Shermanshould start for the sea-coast.Having concentrated his troops at Atlanta by the 14th of November, hecommenced his march, threatening both Augusta and Macon.  His coming-outpoint could not be definitely fixed. Having to gather his subsistence ashe marched through the country, it was not impossible that a forceinferior to his own might compel him to head for such point as he couldreach, instead of such as he might prefer.  The blindness of the enemy,however, in ignoring his movement, and sending Hood's army, the onlyconsiderable force he had west of Richmond and east of the MississippiRiver, northward on an offensive campaign, left the whole country open,and Sherman's route to his own choice.How that campaign was conducted, how little opposition was met with, thecondition of the country through which the armies passed, the capture ofFort McAllister, on the Savannah River, and the occupation of Savannahon the 21st of December, are all clearly set forth in General Sherman'sadmirable report.Soon after General Sherman commenced his march from Atlanta, twoexpeditions, one from Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and one from Vicksburg,Mississippi, were started by General Canby to cut the enemy's lines ofcommunication with Mobile and detain troops in that field.  GeneralFoster, commanding Department of the South, also sent an expedition, viaBroad River, to destroy the railroad between Charleston and Savannah.The expedition from Vicksburg, under command of Brevet Brigadier-GeneralE. D. Osband (colonel 3d United States colored cavalry), captured, onthe 27th of November, and destroyed the Mississippi Central Railroadbridge and trestle-work over Big Black River, near Canton, thirty milesof the road, and two locomotives, besides large amounts of stores.  Theexpedition from Baton Rouge was without favorable results.  Theexpedition from the Department of the South, under the immediate commandof Brigadier-General John P. Hatch, consisting of about five thousandmen of all arms, including a brigade from the navy, proceeded up BroadRiver and debarked at Boyd's Neck on the 29th of November, from where itmoved to strike the railroad at Grahamsville.  At Honey Hill, aboutthree miles from Grahamsville, the enemy was found and attacked in astrongly fortified position, which resulted, after severe fighting, inour repulse with a loss of seven hundred and forty-six in killed,wounded, and missing.  During the night General Hatch withdrew.  On the6th of December General Foster obtained a position covering theCharleston and Savannah Railroad, between the Coosawhatchie andTulifinny rivers.Hood, instead of following Sherman, continued his move northward, whichseemed to me to be leading to his certain doom.  At all events, had Ihad the power to command both armies, I should not have changed theorders under which he seemed to be acting.  On the 26th of October, theadvance of Hood's army attacked the garrison at Decatur, Alabama, butfailing to carry the place, withdrew towards Courtland, and succeeded,in the face of our cavalry, in effecting a lodgment on the north side ofthe Tennessee River, near Florence.  On the 28th, Forrest reached theTennessee, at Fort Heiman, and captured a gunboat and three transports.On the 2d of November he planted batteries above and below Johnsonville,on the opposite side of the river, isolating three gunboats and eighttransports.  On the 4th the enemy opened his batteries upon the place,and was replied to from the gunboats and the garrison.  The gunboatsbecoming disabled were set on fire, as also were the transports, toprevent their falling into the hands of the enemy.  About a million anda half dollars' worth of store and property on the levee and instorehouses was consumed by fire.  On the 5th the enemy disappeared andcrossed to the north side of the Tennessee River, above Johnsonville,moving towards Clifton, and subsequently joined Hood.  On the night ofthe 5th, General Schofield, with the advance of the 23d corps, reachedJohnsonville, but finding the enemy gone, was ordered to Pulaski, andwas put in command of all the troopers there, with instruction to watchthe movements of Hood and retard his advance, but not to risk a generalengagement until the arrival of General A. J. Smith's command fromMissouri, and until General Wilson could get his cavalry remounted.On the 19th, General Hood continued his advance.  General Thomas,retarding him as much as possible, fell back towards Nashville for thepurpose of concentrating his command and gaining time for the arrival ofreinforcements.  The enemy coming up with our main force, commanded byGeneral Schofield, at Franklin, on the 30th, assaulted our worksrepeatedly during the afternoon until late at night, but were in everyinstance repulsed.  His loss in this battle was one thousand sevenhundred and fifty killed, seven hundred and two prisoners, and threethousand eight hundred wounded.  Among his losses were six generalofficers killed, six wounded, and one captured.  Our entire loss was twothousand three hundred.  This was the first serious opposition the enemymet with, and I am satisfied was the fatal blow to all his expectations.During the night, General Schofield fell back towards Nashville.  Thisleft the field to the enemy--not lost by battle, but voluntarilyabandoned--so that General Thomas's whole force might be broughttogether.  The enemy followed up and commenced the establishment of hisline in front of Nashville on the 2d of December.As soon as it was ascertained that Hood was crossing the TennesseeRiver, and that Price was going out of Missouri, General Rosecrans wasordered to send to General Thomas the troops of General A. J. Smith'scommand, and such other troops as he could spare.  The advance of thisreinforcement reached Nashville on the 30th of November.On the morning of the 15th December, General Thomas attacked Hood inposition, and, in a battle lasting two days, defeated and drove him fromthe field in the utmost confusion, leaving in our hand most of hisartillery and many thousand prisoners, including four general officers.Before the battle of Nashville I grew very impatient over, as itappeared to me, the unnecessary delay.  This impatience was increasedupon learning that the enemy had sent a force of cavalry across theCumberland into Kentucky.  I feared Hood would cross his whole army andgive us great trouble there. After urging upon General Thomas thenecessity of immediately assuming the offensive, I started West tosuperintend matters there in person.  Reaching Washington City, Ireceived General Thomas's dispatch announcing his attack upon the enemy,and the result as far as the battle had progressed.  I was delighted.All fears and apprehensions were dispelled.  I am not yet satisfied butthat General Thomas, immediately upon the appearance of Hood beforeNashville, and before he had time to fortify, should have moved out withhis whole force and given him battle, instead of waiting to remount hiscavalry, which delayed him until the inclemency of the weather made itimpracticable to attack earlier than he did.  But his final defeat ofHood was so complete, that it will be accepted as a vindication of thatdistinguished officer's judgment.After Hood's defeat at Nashville he retreated, closely pursued bycavalry and infantry, to the Tennessee River, being forced to abandonmany pieces of artillery and most of his transportation.  On the 28th ofDecember our advanced forces ascertained that he had made good hisescape to the south side of the river.About this time, the rains having set in heavily in Tennessee and NorthAlabama, making it difficult to move army transportation and artillery,General Thomas stopped the pursuit by his main force at the TennesseeRiver.  A small force of cavalry, under Colonel W. J. Palmer, 15thPennsylvania Volunteers, continued to follow Hood for some distance,capturing considerable transportation and all the enemy'spontoon-bridge.  The details of these operations will be foundclearly set forth in General Thomas's report.A cavalry expedition, under Brevet Major-General Grierson, started fromMemphis on the 21st of December.  On the 25th he surprised and capturedForrest's dismounted camp at Verona, Mississippi, on the Mobile and OhioRailroad, destroyed the railroad, sixteen cars loaded with wagons andpontoons for Hood's army, four thousand new English carbines, and largeamounts of public stores.  On the morning of the 28th he attacked andcaptured a force of the enemy at Egypt, and destroyed a train offourteen cars; thence turning to the south-west, he struck theMississippi Central Railroad at Winona, destroyed the factories andlarge amounts of stores at Bankston, and the machine-shops and publicproperty at Grenada, arriving at Vicksburg January 5th.During the operations in Middle Tennessee, the enemy, with a force underGeneral Breckinridge, entered East Tennessee.  On the 13th of Novemberhe attacked General Gillem, near Morristown, capturing his artillery andseveral hundred prisoners.  Gillem, with what was left of his command,retreated to Knoxville.  Following up his success, Breckinridge moved tonear Knoxville, but withdrew on the 18th, followed by General Ammen.Under the directions of General Thomas, General Stoneman concentratedthe commands of Generals Burbridge and Gillem near Bean's Station tooperate against Breckinridge, and destroy or drive him into Virginia--destroy the salt-works at Saltville, and the railroad into Virginiaas far as he could go without endangering his command.  On the 12th ofDecember he commenced his movement, capturing and dispersing the enemy'sforces wherever he met them.  On the 16th he struck the enemy, underVaughn, at Marion, completely routing and pursuing him to Wytheville,capturing all his artillery, trains, and one hundred and ninety-eightprisoners; and destroyed Wytheville, with its stores and supplies, andthe extensive lead-works near there. Returning to Marion, he met a forceunder Breckinridge, consisting, among other troops, of the garrison ofSaltville, that had started in pursuit.  He at once made arrangements toattack it the next morning; but morning found Breckinridge gone.  Hethen moved directly to Saltville, and destroyed the extensive salt-worksat that place, a large amount of stores, and captured eight pieces ofartillery.  Having thus successfully executed his instructions, hereturned General Burbridge to Lexington and General Gillem to Knoxville.Wilmington, North Carolina, was the most important sea-coast port leftto the enemy through which to get supplies from abroad, and send cottonand other products out by blockade-runners, besides being a place ofgreat strategic value.  The navy had been making strenuous exertions toseal the harbor of Wilmington, but with only partial effect.  The natureof the outlet of Cape Fear River was such, that it required watching forso great a distance that, without possession of the land north of NewInlet, or Fort Fisher, it was impossible for the navy to entirely closethe harbor against the entrance of blockade-runners.To secure the possession of this land required the co-operation of aland force, which I agreed to furnish.  Immediately commenced theassemblage in Hampton Roads, under Admiral D. D. Porter, of the mostformidable armada ever collected for concentration upon one given point.This necessarily attracted the attention of the enemy, as well as thatof the loyal North; and through the imprudence of the public press, andvery likely of officers of both branches of service, the exact object ofthe expedition became a subject of common discussion in the newspapersboth North and South.  The enemy, thus warned, prepared to meet it.This caused a postponement of the expedition until the later part ofNovember, when, being again called upon by Hon. G. V. Fox, AssistantSecretary of the Navy, I agreed to furnish the men required at once, andwent myself, in company with Major-General Butler, to Hampton Roads,where we had a conference with Admiral Porter as to the force requiredand the time of starting.  A force of six thousand five hundred men wasregarded as sufficient.  The time of starting was not definitelyarranged, but it was thought all would be ready by the 6th of December,if not before.  Learning, on the 30th of November, that Bragg had goneto Georgia, taking with him most of the forces about Wilmington, Ideemed it of the utmost importance that the expedition should reach itsdestination before the return of Bragg, and directed General Butler tomake all arrangements for the departure of Major-General Weitzel, whohad been designated to command the land forces, so that the navy mightnot be detained one moment.On the 6th of December, the following instructions were given:'CITY POINT, VIRGINIA, December 6, 1864.'GENERAL:  The first object of the expedition under General Weitzel isto close to the enemy the port of Wilmington.  If successful in this,the second will be to capture Wilmington itself.  There are reasonablegrounds to hope for success, if advantage can be taken of the absence ofthe greater part of the enemy's forces now looking after Sherman inGeorgia.  The directions you have given for the numbers and equipment ofthe expedition are all right, except in the unimportant matter of wherethey embark and the amount of intrenching tools to be taken.  The objectof the expedition will be gained by effecting a landing on the main landbetween Cape Fear River and the Atlantic, north of the north entrance tothe river.  Should such landing be effected while the enemy still holdsFort Fisher and the batteries guarding the entrance to the river, thenthe troops should intrench themselves, and, by co-operating with thenavy, effect the reduction and capture of those places.  These in ourhands, the navy could enter the harbor, and the port of Wilmington wouldbe sealed.  Should Fort Fisher and the point of land on which it isbuilt fall into the hands of our troops immediately on landing, then itwill be worth the attempt to capture Wilmington by a forced march andsurprise.  If time is consumed in gaining the first object of theexpedition, the second will become a matter of after consideration.'The details for execution are intrusted to you and the officerimmediately in command of the troops.'Should the troops under General Weitzel fail to effect a landing at ornear Fort Fisher, they will be returned to the armies operating againstRichmond without delay.'U. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General.'MAJOR-GENERAL B. F. BUTLER.'General Butler commanding the army from which the troops were taken forthis enterprise, and the territory within which they were to operate,military courtesy required that all orders and instructions should gothrough him.  They were so sent, but General Weitzel has sinceofficially informed me that he never received the foregoinginstructions, nor was he aware of their existence, until he read GeneralButler's published official report of the Fort Fisher failure, with myindorsement and papers accompanying it.  I had no idea of GeneralButler's accompanying the expedition until the evening before it got offfrom Bermuda Hundred, and then did not dream but that General Weitzelhad received all the instructions, and would be in command.  I ratherformed the idea that General Butler was actuated by a desire to witnessthe effect of the explosion of the powder-boat.  The expedition wasdetained several days at Hampton Roads, awaiting the loading of thepowder-boat.The importance of getting the Wilmington expedition off without anydelay, with or without the powder-boat, had been urged upon GeneralButler, and he advised to so notify Admiral Porter.The expedition finally got off on the 13th of December, and arrived atthe place of rendezvous, off New Inlet, near Fort Fisher, on the eveningof the 15th.  Admiral Porter arrived on the evening of the 18th, havingput in at Beaufort to get ammunition for the monitors.  The sea becomingrough, making it difficult to land troops, and the supply of water andcoal being about exhausted, the transport fleet put back to Beaufort toreplenish; this, with the state of the weather, delayed the return tothe place of rendezvous until the 24th.  The powder-boat was exploded onthe morning of the 24th, before the return of General Butler fromBeaufort; but it would seem, from the notice taken of it in the Southernnewspapers, that the enemy were never enlightened as to the object ofthe explosion until they were informed by the Northern press.On the 25th a landing was effected without opposition, and areconnoissance, under Brevet Brigadier-General Curtis, pushed up towardsthe fort.  But before receiving a full report of the result of thisreconnoissance, General Butler, in direct violation of the instructionsgiven, ordered the re-embarkation of the troops and the return of theexpedition.  The re-embarkation was accomplished by the morning of the27th.On the return of the expedition officers and men among them BrevetMajor-General (then Brevet Brigadier-General) N. M. Curtis,First-Lieutenant G. W. Ross, 117th Regiment New York Volunteers,First-Lieutenant William H. Walling, and Second-Lieutenant GeorgeSimpson, 142d New York Volunteers voluntarily reported to me that whenrecalled they were nearly into the fort, and, in their opinion, it couldhave been taken without much loss.Soon after the return of the expedition, I received a dispatch from theSecretary of the Navy, and a letter from Admiral Porter, informing methat the fleet was still off Fort Fisher, and expressing the convictionthat, under a proper leader, the place could be taken.  The naturalsupposition with me was, that when the troops abandoned the expedition,the navy would do so also.  Finding it had not, however, I answered onthe 30th of December, advising Admiral Porter to hold on, and that Iwould send a force and make another attempt to take the place.  Thistime I selected Brevet Major-General (now Major-General) A. H. Terry tocommand the expedition.  The troops composing it consisted of the samethat composed the former, with the addition of a small brigade,numbering about one thousand five hundred, and a small siege train.  Thelatter it was never found necessary to land.  I communicated direct tothe commander of the expedition the following instructions:'CITY POINT, VIRGINIA, January 3, 1865.'GENERAL:  The expedition intrusted to your command has been fitted outto renew the attempt to capture Fort Fisher, N. C., and Wilmingtonultimately, if the fort falls.  You will then proceed with as littledelay as possible to the naval fleet lying off Cape Fear River, andreport the arrival of yourself and command to Admiral D. D. Porter,commanding North Atlantic Blockading Squadron.'It is exceedingly desirable that the most complete understanding shouldexist between yourself and the naval commander.  I suggest, therefore,that you consult with Admiral Porter freely, and get from him the partto be performed by each branch of the public service, so that there maybe unity of action.  It would be well to have the whole programme laiddown in writing.  I have served with Admiral Porter, and know that youcan rely on his judgment and his nerve to undertake what he proposes.  Iwould, therefore, defer to him as much as is consistent with your ownresponsibilities.  The first object to be attained is to get a firmposition on the spit of land on which Fort Fisher is built, from whichyou can operate against that fort.  You want to look to thepracticability of receiving your supplies, and to defending yourselfagainst superior forces sent against you by any of the avenues left opento the enemy. If such a position can be obtained, the siege of FortFisher will not be abandoned until its reduction is accomplished, oranother plan of campaign is ordered from these headquarters.'My own views are, that if you effect a landing, the navy ought to run aportion of their fleet into Cape Fear River, while the balance of itoperates on the outside.  Land forces cannot invest Fort Fisher, or cutit off from supplies or reinforcements, while the river is in possessionof the enemy.'A siege-train will be loaded on vessels and sent to Fort Monroe, inreadiness to be sent to you if required.  All other supplies can bedrawn from Beaufort as you need them.'Keep the fleet of vessels with you until your position is assured.When you find they can be spared, order them back, or such of them asyou can spare, to Fort Monroe, to report for orders.'In case of failure to effect a landing, bring your command back toBeaufort, and report to these headquarters for further instructions.You will not debark at Beaufort until so directed.'General Sheridan has been ordered to send a division of troops toBaltimore and place them on sea-going vessels.  These troops will bebrought to Fort Monroe and kept there on the vessels until you are heardfrom.  Should you require them, they will be sent to you.'U. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General.'BREVET MAJOR-GENERAL A. H. TERRY.'Lieutenant-Colonel C. B. Comstock, aide-de-camp (now brevetbrigadier-general), who accompanied the former expedition,was assigned, in orders, as chief-engineer to this.It will be seen that these instructions did not differ materially fromthose given for the first expedition, and that in neither instance wasthere an order to assault Fort Fisher. This was a matter left entirelyto the discretion of the commanding officer.The expedition sailed from Fort Monroe on the morning of the 6th,arriving at the rendezvous, off Beaufort, on the 8th, where, owing tothe difficulties of the weather, it lay until the morning of the 12th,when it got under way and reached its destination that evening.  Undercover of the fleet, the disembarkation of the troops commenced on themorning of the 13th, and by three o'clock P.M. was completed withoutloss.  On the 14th a reconnoissance was pushed to within five hundredyards of Fort Fisher, and a small advance work taken possession of andturned into a defensive line against any attempt that might be made fromthe fort.  This reconnoissance disclosed the fact that the front of thework had been seriously injured by the navy fire.  In the afternoon ofthe 15th the fort was assaulted, and after most desperate fighting wascaptured, with its entire garrison and armament.  Thus was secured, bythe combined efforts of the navy and army, one of the most importantsuccesses of the war.  Our loss was:  killed, one hundred and ten;wounded, five hundred and thirty-six.  On the 16th and the 17th theenemy abandoned and blew up Fort Caswell and the works on Smith'sIsland, which were immediately occupied by us.  This gave us entirecontrol of the mouth of the Cape Fear River.At my request, Mayor-General B. F. Butler was relieved, andMajor-General E. O. C. Ord assigned to the Department of Virginia andNorth Carolina.The defence of the line of the Tennessee no longer requiring the forcewhich had beaten and nearly destroyed the only army now threatening it,I determined to find other fields of operation for General Thomas'ssurplus troops--fields from which they would co-operate with othermovements.  General Thomas was therefore directed to collect all troops,not essential to hold his communications at Eastport, in readiness fororders.  On the 7th of January, General Thomas was directed, if he wasassured of the departure of Hood south from Corinth, to send GeneralSchofield with his corps east with as little delay as possible.  Thisdirection was promptly complied with, and the advance of the corpsreached Washington on the 23d of the same month, whence it was sent toFort Fisher and New Bern.  On the 26th he was directed to send GeneralA. J. Smith's command and a division of cavalry to report to GeneralCanby.  By the 7th of February the whole force was en route for itsdestination.The State of North Carolina was constituted into a military department,and General Schofield assigned to command, and placed under the ordersof Major-General Sherman.  The following instructions were given him:'CITY POINT, VA., January 31, 1865.'GENERAL:-- *    *    *    Your movements are intended as co-operativewith Sherman's through the States of South and North Carolina.  Thefirst point to be attained is to secure Wilmington.  Goldsboro' willthen be your objective point, moving either from Wilmington or New Bern,or both, as you deem best.  Should you not be able to reach Goldsboro',you will advance on the line or lines of railway connecting that placewith the sea-coast--as near to it as you can, building the road behindyou.  The enterprise under you has two objects:  the first is to giveGeneral Sherman material aid, if needed, in his march north; the second,to open a base of supplies for him on his line of march.  As soon,therefore, as you can determine which of the two points, Wilmington orNew Bern, you can best use for throwing supplies from, to the interior,you will commence the accumulation of twenty days' rations and foragefor sixty thousand men and twenty thousand animals.  You will get ofthese as many as you can house and protect to such point in the interioras you may be able to occupy.  I believe General Palmer has receivedsome instructions direct from General Sherman on the subject of securingsupplies for his army.  You will learn what steps he has taken, and begoverned in your requisitions accordingly.  A supply of ordnance storeswill also be necessary.'Make all requisitions upon the chiefs of their respective departmentsin the field with me at City Point.  Communicate with me by everyopportunity, and should you deem it necessary at any time, send aspecial boat to Fortress Monroe, from which point you can communicate bytelegraph.'The supplies referred to in these instructions are exclusive of thoserequired for your own command.'The movements of the enemy may justify, or even make it your imperativeduty, to cut loose from your base, and strike for the interior to aidSherman.  In such case you will act on your own judgment without waitingfor instructions.  You will report, however, what you purpose doing.The details for carrying out these instructions are necessarily left toyou.  I would urge, however, if I did not know that you are alreadyfully alive to the importance of it, prompt action.  Sherman may belooked for in the neighborhood of Goldsboro' any time from the 22d tothe 28th of February; this limits your time very materially.'If rolling-stock is not secured in the capture of Wilmington, it can besupplied from Washington.  A large force of railroad men have alreadybeen sent to Beaufort, and other mechanics will go to Fort Fisher in aday or two.  On this point I have informed you by telegraph.'U. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General.'MAJOR-GENERAL J. M. SCHOFIELD.'Previous to giving these instructions I had visited Fort Fisher,accompanied by General Schofield, for the purpose of seeing for myselfthe condition of things, and personally conferring with General Terryand Admiral Porter as to what was best to be done.Anticipating the arrival of General Sherman at Savannah his armyentirely foot-loose, Hood being then before Nashville, Tennessee, theSouthern railroads destroyed, so that it would take several months tore-establish a through line from west to east, and regarding the captureof Lee's army as the most important operation towards closing therebellion--I sent orders to General Sherman on the 6th of December, thatafter establishing a base on the sea-coast, with necessary garrison, toinclude all his artillery and cavalry, to come by water to City Pointwith the balance of his command.On the 18th of December, having received information of the defeat andutter rout of Hood's army by General Thomas, and that, owing to thegreat difficulty of procuring ocean transportation, it would take overtwo months to transport Sherman's army, and doubting whether he mightnot contribute as much towards the desired result by operating fromwhere he was, I wrote to him to that effect, and asked him for his viewsas to what would be best to do.  A few days after this I received acommunication from General Sherman, of date 16th December, acknowledgingthe receipt of my order of the 6th, and informing me of his preparationsto carry it into effect as soon as he could get transportation.  Alsothat he had expected, upon reducing Savannah, instantly to march toColumbia, South Carolina, thence to Raleigh, and thence to report to me;but that this would consume about six weeks' time after the fall ofSavannah, whereas by sea he could probably reach me by the middle ofJanuary.  The confidence he manifested in this letter of being able tomarch up and join me pleased me, and, without waiting for a reply to myletter of the 18th, I directed him, on the 28th of December, to makepreparations to start as he proposed, without delay, to break up therailroads in North and South Carolina, and join the armies operatingagainst Richmond as soon as he could.On the 21st of January I informed General Sherman that I had ordered the23d corps,  Major-General Schofield commanding, east; that it numberedabout twenty-one thousand men; that we had at Fort Fisher, about eightthousand men; at New Bern, about four thousand; that if Wilmington wascaptured, General Schofield would go there; if not, he would be sent toNew Bern; that, in either event, all the surplus force at both pointswould move to the interior towards Goldsboro', in co-operation with hismovement; that from either point railroad communication could be runout; and that all these troops would be subject to his orders as he cameinto communication with them.In obedience to his instructions, General Schofield proceeded to reduceWilmington, North Carolina, in co-operation with the navy under AdmiralPorter, moving his forces up both sides of the Cape Fear River.  FortAnderson, the enemy's main defence on the west bank of the river, wasoccupied on the morning of the 19th, the enemy having evacuated it afterour appearance before it.After fighting on 20th and 21st, our troops entered Wilmington on themorning of the 22d, the enemy having retreated towards Goldsboro' duringthe night.  Preparations were at once made for a movement on Goldsboro'in two columns--one from Wilmington, and the other from New Bern--and torepair the railroad leading there from each place, as well as to supplyGeneral Sherman by Cape Fear River, towards Fayetteville, if it becamenecessary.  The column from New Bern was attacked on the 8th of March,at Wise's Forks, and driven back with the loss of several hundredprisoners.  On the 11th the enemy renewed his attack upon our intrenchedposition, but was repulsed with severe loss, and fell back during thenight.  On the 14th the Neuse River was crossed and Kinston occupied,and on the 21st Goldsboro' was entered. The column from Wilmingtonreached Cox's Bridge, on the Neuse River, ten miles above Goldsboro', onthe 22d.By the 1st of February, General Sherman's whole army was in motion fromSavannah.  He captured Columbia, South Carolina, on the 17th; thencemoved on Goldsboro', North Carolina, via Fayetteville, reaching thelatter place on the 12th of March, opening up communication with GeneralSchofield by way of Cape Fear River.  On the 15th he resumed his marchon Goldsboro'.  He met a force of the enemy at Averysboro', and after asevere fight defeated and compelled it to retreat.  Our loss in thisengagement was about six hundred.  The enemy's loss was much greater.On the 18th the combined forces of the enemy, under Joe Johnston,attacked his advance at Bentonville, capturing three guns and driving itback upon the main body.  General Slocum, who was in the advanceascertaining that the whole of Johnston's army was in the front,arranged his troops on the defensive, intrenched himself and awaitedreinforcements, which were pushed forward.  On the night of the 21st theenemy retreated to Smithfield, leaving his dead and wounded in ourhands.  From there Sherman continued to Goldsboro', which place had beenoccupied by General Schofield on the 21st (crossing the Neuse River tenmiles above there, at Cox's Bridge, where General Terry had gotpossession and thrown a pontoon-bridge on the 22d), thus forming ajunction with the columns from New Bern and Wilmington.Among the important fruits of this campaign was the fall of Charleston,South Carolina. It was evacuated by the enemy on the night of the 17thof February, and occupied by our forces on the 18th.On the morning of the 31st of January, General Thomas was directed tosend a cavalry expedition, under General Stoneman, from East Tennessee,to penetrate South Carolina well down towards Columbia, to destroy therailroads and military resources of the country, and return, if he wasable, to East Tennessee by way of Salisbury, North Carolina, releasingour prisoners there, if possible.  Of the feasibility of this latter,however, General Stoneman was to judge.  Sherman's movements, I had nodoubt, would attract the attention of all the force the enemy couldcollect, and facilitate the execution of this.  General Stoneman was solate in making his start on this expedition (and Sherman having passedout of the State of South Carolina), on the 27th of February I directedGeneral Thomas to change his course, and order him to repeat his raid oflast fall, destroying the railroad towards Lynchburg as far as he could.This would keep him between our garrisons in East Tennessee and theenemy.  I regarded it not impossible that in the event of the enemybeing driven from Richmond, he might fall back to Lynchburg and attempta raid north through East Tennessee.  On the 14th of February thefollowing communication was sent to General Thomas:'CITY POINT, VA., February 14, 1865.'General Canby is preparing a movement from Mobile Bay against Mobileand the interior of Alabama. His force will consist of about twentythousand men, besides A. J. Smith's command.  The cavalry you have sentto Canby will be debarked at Vicksburg. It, with the available cavalryalready in that section, will move from there eastward, in co-operation.Hood's army has been terribly reduced by the severe punishment you gaveit in Tennessee, by desertion consequent upon their defeat, and now bythe withdrawal of many of them to oppose Sherman.  (I take it a largeportion of the infantry has been so withdrawn.  It is so asserted in theRichmond papers, and a member of the rebel Congress said a few dayssince in a speech, that one-half of it had been brought to SouthCarolina to oppose Sherman.)  This being true, or even if it is nottrue, Canby's movement will attract all the attention of the enemy, andleave the advance from your standpoint easy.  I think it advisable,therefore, that you prepare as much of a cavalry force as you can spare,and hold it in readiness to go south.  The object would be threefold:first, to attract as much of the enemy's force as possible, to insuresuccess to Canby; second, to destroy the enemy's line of communicationsand military resources; third, to destroy or capture their forcesbrought into the field. Tuscaloosa and Selma would probably be thepoints to direct the expedition against.  This, however, would not be soimportant as the mere fact of penetrating deep into Alabama.  Discretionshould be left to the officer commanding the expedition to go where,according to the information he may receive, he will best secure theobjects named above.'Now that your force has been so much depleted, I do not know whatnumber of men you can put into the field.  If not more than fivethousand men, however, all cavalry, I think it will be sufficient.  Itis not desirable that you should start this expedition until the oneleaving Vicksburg has been three or four days out, or even a week.  I donot know when it will start, but will inform you by telegraph as soon asI learn.  If you should hear through other sources before hearing fromme, you can act on the information received.'To insure success your cavalry should go with as little wagon-train aspossible, relying upon the country for supplies.  I would also reducethe number of guns to a battery, or the number of batteries, and put theextra teams to the guns taken.  No guns or caissons should be taken withless than eight horses.'Please inform me by telegraph, on receipt of this, what force you thinkyou will be able to send under these directions.'U. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General.'MAJOR-GENERAL G. H. THOMAS.'On the 15th, he was directed to start the expedition as soon after the20th as he could get it off.I deemed it of the utmost importance, before a general movement of thearmies operating against Richmond, that all communications with thecity, north of James River, should be cut off.  The enemy havingwithdrawn the bulk of his force from the Shenandoah Valley and sent itsouth, or replaced troops sent from Richmond, and desiring to reinforceSherman, if practicable, whose cavalry was greatly inferior in numbersto that of the enemy, I determined to make a move from the Shenandoah,which, if successful, would accomplish the first at least, and possiblythe latter of the objects.  I therefore telegraphed General Sheridan asfollows:'CITY POINT, VA., February 20, 1865--1 P.M.'GENERAL:--As soon as it is possible to travel, I think you will have nodifficulty about reaching Lynchburg with a cavalry force alone.  Fromthere you could destroy the railroad and canal in every direction, so asto be of no further use to the rebellion.  Sufficient cavalry should beleft behind to look after Mosby's gang.  From Lynchburg, if informationyou might get there would justify it, you will strike south, heading thestreams in Virgina to the westward of Danville, and push on and joinGeneral Sherman.  This additional raid, with one now about starting fromEast Tennessee under Stoneman, numbering four or give thousand cavalry,one from Vicksburg, numbering seven or eight thousand cavalry, one fromEastport, Mississippi, then thousand cavalry, Canby from Mobile Bay,with about thirty-eight thousand mixed troops, these three latterpushing for Tuscaloosa, Selma, and Montgomery, and Sherman with a largearmy eating out the vitals of South Carolina, is all that will be wantedto leave nothing for the rebellion to stand upon.  I would advise you toovercome great obstacles to accomplish this.  Charleston was evacuatedon Tuesday 1st.'U. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General.'MAJOR-GENERAL P. H. SHERIDAN.'On the 25th I received a dispatch from General Sheridan, inquiring whereSherman was aiming for, and if I could give him definite information asto the points he might be expected to move on, this side of Charlotte,North Carolina.  In answer, the following telegram was sent him:'CITY POINT, VA., February 25, 1865.'GENERAL:--Sherman's movements will depend on the amount of oppositionhe meets with from the enemy.  If strongly opposed, he may possibly haveto fall back to Georgetown, S. C., and fit out for a new start.  Ithink, however, all danger for the necessity of going to that point haspassed.  I believe he has passed Charlotte.  He may take Fayetteville onhis way to Goldsboro'.  If you reach Lynchburg, you will have to beguided in your after movements by the information you obtain.  Beforeyou could possibly reach Sherman, I think you would find him moving fromGoldsboro' towards Raleigh, or engaging the enemy strongly posted at oneor the other of these places, with railroad communications opened fromhis army to Wilmington or New Bern.'U. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General.'MAJOR-GENERAL P. H. SHERIDAN.'General Sheridan moved from Winchester on the 27th of February, with twodivisions of cavalry, numbering about five thousand each.  On the 1st ofMarch he secured the bridge, which the enemy attempted to destroy,across the middle fork of the Shenandoah, at Mount Crawford, and enteredStaunton on the 2d, the enemy having retreated to Waynesboro'.  Thencehe pushed on to Waynesboro', where he found the enemy in force in anintrenched position, under General Early.  Without stopping to make areconnoissance, an immediate attack was made, the position was carried,and sixteen hundred prisoners, eleven pieces of artillery, with horsesand caissons complete, two hundred wagons and teams loaded withsubsistence, and seventeen battle-flags, were captured.  The prisoners,under an escort of fifteen hundred men, were sent back to Winchester.Thence he marched on Charlottesville, destroying effectually therailroad and bridges as he went, which place he reached on the 3d.  Herehe remained two days, destroying the railroad towards Richmond andLynchburg, including the large iron bridges over the north and southforks of the Rivanna River and awaited the arrival of his trains.  Thisnecessary delay caused him to abandon the idea of capturing Lynchburg.On the morning of the 6th, dividing his force into two columns, he sentone to Scottsville, whence it marched up the James River Canal to NewMarket, destroying every lock, and in many places the bank of the canal.From here a force was pushed out from this column to Duiguidsville, toobtain possession of the bridge across the James River at that place,but failed.  The enemy burned it on our approach.  The enemy also burnedthe bridge across the river at Hardwicksville.  The other column moveddown the railroad towards Lynchburg, destroying it as far as AmherstCourt House, sixteen miles from Lynchburg; thence across the country,uniting with the column at New Market.  The river being very high, hispontoons would not reach across it; and the enemy having destroyed thebridges by which he had hoped to cross the river and get on the SouthSide Railroad about Farmville, and destroy it to Appomattox Court House,the only thing left for him was to return to Winchester or strike a baseat the White House. Fortunately, he chose the latter.  From New Markethe took up his line of march, following the canal towards Richmond,destroying every lock upon it and cutting the banks whereverpracticable, to a point eight miles east of Goochland, concentrating thewhole force at Columbia on the 10th.  Here he rested one day, and sentthrough by scouts information of his whereabouts and purposes, and arequest for supplies to meet him at White House, which reached me on thenight of the 12th.  An infantry force was immediately sent to getpossession of White House, and supplies were forwarded.  Moving fromColumbia in a direction to threaten Richmond, to near Ashland Station,he crossed the Annas, and after having destroyed all the bridges andmany miles of the railroad, proceeded down the north bank of thePamunkey to White House, which place he reached on the 19th.Previous to this the following communication was sent to General Thomas:'CITY POINT, VIRGINIA, March 7, 1865--9.30 A.M.'GENERAL:--I think it will be advisable now for you to repair therailroad in East Tennessee, and throw a good force up to Bull's Gap andfortify there.  Supplies at Knoxville could always be got forward asrequired.  With Bull's Gap fortified, you can occupy as outposts aboutall of East Tennessee, and be prepared, if it should be required of youin the spring, to make a campaign towards Lynchburg, or into NorthCarolina.  I do not think Stoneman should break the road until he getsinto Virginia, unless it should be to cut off rolling-stock that may becaught west of that.'U. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General.'MAJOR-GENERAL G. H. THOMAS.'Thus it will be seen that in March, 1865, General Canby was moving anadequate force against Mobile and the army defending it under GeneralDick Taylor; Thomas was pushing out two large and well-appointed cavalryexpeditions--one from Middle Tennessee under Brevet Major-General Wilsonagainst the enemy's vital points in Alabama, the other from EastTennessee, under Major-General Stoneman, towards Lynchburg--andassembling the remainder of his available forces, preparatory tocommence offensive operations from East Tennessee; General Sheridan'scavalry was at White House; the armies of the Potomac and James wereconfronting the enemy, under Lee, in his defences of Richmond andPetersburg; General Sherman with his armies, reinforced by that ofGeneral Schofield, was at Goldsboro'; General Pope was makingpreparations for a spring campaign against the enemy under Kirby Smithand Price, west of the Mississippi; and General Hancock wasconcentrating a force in the vicinity of Winchester, Virginia, to guardagainst invasion or to operate offensively, as might prove necessary.After the long march by General Sheridan's cavalry over winter roads, itwas necessary to rest and refit at White House.  At this time thegreatest source of uneasiness to me was the fear that the enemy wouldleave his strong lines about Petersburg and Richmond for the purpose ofuniting with Johnston, and before he was driven from them by battle, orI was prepared to make an effectual pursuit.  On the 24th of March,General Sheridan moved from White House, crossed the James River atJones's Landing, and formed a junction with the Army of the Potomac infront of Petersburg on the 27th.  During this move, General Ord sentforces to cover the crossings of the Chickahominy.On the 24th of March the following instructions for a general movementof the armies operating against Richmond were issued:'CITY POINT, VIRGINIA, March 24, 1865.'GENERAL:  On the 29th instant the armies operating against Richmondwill be moved by our left, for the double purpose of turning the enemyout of his present position around Petersburg, and to insure the successof the cavalry under General Sheridan, which will start at the sametime, in its efforts to reach and destroy the South Side and Danvillerailroads.  Two corps of the Army of the Potomac will be moved at firstin two columns, taking the two roads crossing Hatcher's Run, nearestwhere the present line held by us strikes that stream, both movingtowards Dinwiddie Court House.'The cavalry under General Sheridan, joined by the division now underGeneral Davies, will move at the same time by the Weldon Road and theJerusalem Plank Road, turning west from the latter before crossing theNottoway, and west with the whole column before reaching Stony Creek.General Sheridan will then move independently, under other instructionswhich will be given him.  All dismounted cavalry belonging to the Armyof the Potomac, and the dismounted cavalry from the Middle MilitaryDivision not required for guarding property belonging to their arm ofservice, will report to Brigadier-General Benham, to be added to thedefences of City Point.  Major-General Parke will be left in command ofall the army left for holding the lines about Petersburg and City Point,subject of course to orders from the commander of the Army of thePotomac.  The 9th army corps will be left intact, to hold the presentline of works so long as the whole line now occupied by us is held.  If,however, the troops to the left of the 9th corps are withdrawn, then theleft of the corps may be thrown back so as to occupy the position heldby the army prior to the capture of the Weldon Road.  All troops to theleft of the 9th corps will be held in readiness to move at the shortestnotice by such route as may be designated when the order is given.'General Ord will detach three divisions, two white and one colored, orso much of them as he can, and hold his present lines, and march for thepresent left of the Army of the Potomac.  In the absence of furtherorders, or until further orders are given, the white divisions willfollow the left column of the Army of the Potomac, and the coloreddivision the right column.  During the movement Major-General Weitzelwill be left in command of all the forces remaining behind from the Armyof the James.'The movement of troops from the Army of the James will commence on thenight of the 27th instant.  General Ord will leave behind the minimumnumber of cavalry necessary for picket duty, in the absence of the mainarmy.  A cavalry expedition, from General Ord's command, will also bestarted from Suffolk, to leave there on Saturday, the 1st of April,under Colonel Sumner, for the purpose of cutting the railroad aboutHicksford.  This, if accomplished, will have to be a surprise, andtherefore from three to five hundred men will be sufficient.  Theyshould, however, be supported by all the infantry that can be sparedfrom Norfolk and Portsmouth, as far out as to where the cavalry crossesthe Blackwater.  The crossing should probably be at Uniten.  ShouldColonel Sumner succeed in reaching the Weldon Road, he will beinstructed to do all the damage possible to the triangle of roadsbetween Hicksford, Weldon, and Gaston.  The railroad bridge at Weldonbeing fitted up for the passage of carriages, it might be practicable todestroy any accumulation of supplies the enemy may have collected southof the Roanoke. All the troops will move with four days' rations inhaversacks and eight days' in wagons.  To avoid as much hauling aspossible, and to give the Army of the James the same number of days'supplies with the Army of the Potomac, General Ord will direct hiscommissary and quartermaster to have sufficient supplies delivered atthe terminus of the road to fill up in passing.  Sixty rounds ofammunition per man will be taken in wagons, and as much grain as thetransportation on hand will carry, after taking the specified amount ofother supplies.  The densely wooded country in which the army has tooperate making the use of much artillery impracticable, the amount takenwith the army will be reduced to six or eight guns to each division, atthe option of the army commanders.'All necessary preparations for carrying these directions into operationmay be commenced at once.  The reserves of the 9th corps should bemassed as much as possible.  While I would not now order anunconditional attack on the enemy's line by them, they should be readyand should make the attack if the enemy weakens his line in their front,without waiting for orders.  In case they carry the line, then the wholeof the 9th corps could follow up so as to join or co-operate with thebalance of the army.  To prepare for this, the 9th corps will haverations issued to them, same as the balance of the army.  GeneralWeitzel will keep vigilant watch upon his front, and if found at allpracticable to break through at any point, he will do so.  A successnorth of the James should be followed up with great promptness.  Anattack will not be feasible unless it is found that the enemy hasdetached largely.  In that case it may be regarded as evident that theenemy are relying upon their local reserves principally for the defenceof Richmond.  Preparations may be made for abandoning all the line northof the James, except inclosed works only to be abandoned, however, aftera break is made in the lines of the enemy.'By these instructions a large part of the armies operating againstRichmond is left behind.  The enemy, knowing this, may, as an onlychance, strip their lines to the merest skeleton, in the hope ofadvantage not being taken of it, while they hurl everything against themoving column, and return.  It cannot be impressed too strongly uponcommanders of troops left in the trenches not to allow this to occurwithout taking advantage of it.  The very fact of the enemy coming outto attack, if he does so, might be regarded as almost conclusiveevidence of such a weakening of his lines.  I would have it particularlyenjoined upon corps commanders that, in case of an attack from theenemy, those not attacked are not to wait for orders from the commandingofficer of the army to which they belong, but that they will movepromptly, and notify the commander of their action.  I would also enjointhe same action on the part of division commanders when other parts oftheir corps are engaged.  In like manner, I would urge the importance offollowing up a repulse of the enemy.'U. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General.'MAJOR-GENERALS MEADE, ORD, AND SHERIDAN.'Early on the morning of the 25th the enemy assaulted our lines in frontof the 9th corps (which held from the Appomattox River towards ourleft), and carried Fort Stedman, and a part of the line to the right andleft of it, established themselves and turned the guns of the fortagainst us, but our troops on either flank held their ground until thereserves were brought up, when the enemy was driven back with a heavyloss in killed and wounded, and one thousand nine hundred prisoners.Our loss was sixty-eight killed, three hundred and thirty-seven wounded,and five hundred and six missing.  General Meade at once ordered theother corps to advance and feel the enemy in their respective fronts.Pushing forward, they captured and held the enemy's strongly intrenchedpicket-line in front of the 2d and 6th corps, and eight hundred andthirty-four prisoners.  The enemy made desperate attempts to retake thisline, but without success.  Our loss in front of these was fifty-twokilled, eight hundred and sixty-four wounded, and two hundred and sevenmissing.  The enemy's loss in killed and wounded was far greater.General Sherman having got his troops all quietly in camp aboutGoldsboro', and his preparations for furnishing supplies to themperfected, visited me at City Point on the 27th of March, and statedthat he would be ready to move, as he had previously written me, by the10th of April, fully equipped and rationed for twenty days, if it shouldbecome necessary to bring his command to bear against Lee's army, inco-operation with our forces in front of Richmond and Petersburg.General Sherman proposed in this movement to threaten Raleigh, and then,by turning suddenly to the right, reach the Roanoke at Gaston orthereabouts, whence he could move on to the Richmond and DanvilleRailroad, striking it in the vicinity of Burkesville, or join the armiesoperating against Richmond, as might be deemed best.  This plan he wasdirected to carry into execution, if he received no further directionsin the meantime.  I explained to him the movement I had ordered tocommence on the 29th of March.  That if it should not prove as entirelysuccessful as I hoped, I would cut the cavalry loose to destroy theDanville and South Side railroads, and thus deprive the enemy of furthersupplies, and also to prevent the rapid concentration of Lee's andJohnston's armies.I had spent days of anxiety lest each morning should bring the reportthat the enemy had retreated the night before.  I was firmly convincedthat Sherman's crossing the Roanoke would be the signal for Lee toleave.  With Johnston and him combined, a long, tedious, and expensivecampaign, consuming most of the summer, might become necessary.  Bymoving out I would put the army in better condition for pursuit, andwould at least, by the destruction of the Danville Road, retard theconcentration of the two armies of Lee and Johnston, and cause the enemyto abandon much material that he might otherwise save.  I thereforedetermined not to delay the movement ordered.On the night of the 27th, Major-General Ord, with two divisions of the24th corps, Major-General Gibbon commanding, and one division of the25th corps, Brigadier-General Birney commanding, and MacKenzie'scavalry, took up his line of march in pursuance of the foregoinginstructions, and reached the position assigned him near Hatcher's Runon the morning of the 29th.  On the 28th the following instructions weregiven to General Sheridan:'CITY POINT, VA., March 28, 1865.'GENERAL:--The 5th army corps will move by the Vaughn Road at three A.M.to-morrow morning.  The 2d moves at about nine A.M., having but aboutthree miles to march to reach the point designated for it to take on theright of the 5th corps, after the latter reaching Dinwiddie Court House.Move your cavalry at as early an hour as you can, and without beingconfined to any particular road or roads.  You may go out by the nearestroads in rear of the 5th corps, pass by its left, and passing near to orthrough Dinwiddie, reach the right and rear of the enemy as soon as youcan.  It is not the intention to attack the enemy in his intrenchedposition, but to force him out, if possible. Should he come out andattack us, or get himself where he can be attacked, move in with yourentire force in your own way, and with the full reliance that the armywill engage or follow, as circumstances will dictate.  I shall be on thefield, and will probably be able to communicate with you.  Should I notdo so, and you find that the enemy keeps within his main intrenchedline, you may cut loose and push for the Danville Road.  If you find itpracticable, I would like you to cross the South Side Road, betweenPetersburg and Burkesville, and destroy it to some extent.  I would notadvise much detention, however, until you reach the Danville Road, whichI would like you to strike as near to the Appomattox as possible.  Makeyour destruction on that road as complete as possible.  You can thenpass on to the South Side Road, west of Burkesville, and destroy that inlike manner.'After having accomplished the destruction of the two railroads, whichare now the only avenues of supply to Lee's army, you may return to thisarmy, selecting your road further south, or you may go on into NorthCarolina and join General Sherman.  Should you select the latter course,get the information to me as early as possible, so that I may sendorders to meet you at Goldsboro'.'U. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General.'MAJOR-GENERAL P. H. SHERIDAN.'On the morning of the 29th the movement commenced.  At night the cavalrywas at Dinwiddie Court House, and the left of our infantry line extendedto the Quaker Road, near its intersection with the Boydton Plank Road.The position of the troops from left to right was as follows:  Sheridan,Warren, Humphreys, Ord, Wright, Parke.Everything looked favorable to the defeat of the enemy and the captureof Petersburg and Richmond, if the proper effort was made.  I thereforeaddressed the following communication to General Sheridan, havingpreviously informed him verbally not to cut loose for the raidcontemplated in his orders until he received notice from me to do so:'GRAVELLY CREEK, March 29, 1865.'GENERAL:--Our line is now unbroken from the Appomattox to Dinwiddie.We are all ready, however, to give up all, from the Jerusalem Plank Roadto Hatcher's Run, whenever the forces can be used advantageously.  Aftergetting into line south of Hatcher's, we pushed forward to find theenemy's position. General Griffin was attacked near where the QuakerRoad intersects the Boydton Road, but repulsed it easily, capturingabout one hundred men.  Humphreys reached Dabney's Mill, and was pushingon when last heard from.'I now feel like ending the matter, if it is possible to do so, beforegoing back.  I do not want you, therefore, to cut loose and go after theenemy's roads at present.  In the morning push around the enemy, if youcan, and get on to his right rear.  The movements of the enemy's cavalrymay, of course, modify your action.  We will act all together as onearmy here, until it is seen what can be done with the enemy.  Thesignal-officer at Cobb's Hill reported, at half-past eleven A.M., that acavalry column had passed that point from Richmond towards Petersburg,taking forty minutes to pass.'U. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General.'MAJOR-GENERAL P. H. SHERIDAN.'From the night of the 29th to the morning of the 31st the rain fell insuch torrents as to make it impossible to move a wheeled vehicle, exceptas corduroy roads were laid in front of them. During the 30th, Sheridanadvanced from Dinwiddie Court House towards Five Forks, where he foundthe enemy in full force. General Warren advanced and extended his lineacross the Boydton Plank Road to near the White Oak Road, with a view ofgetting across the latter; but, finding the enemy strong in his frontand extending beyond his left, was directed to hold on where he was, andfortify.  General Humphreys drove the enemy from his front into his mainline on the Hatcher, near Burgess's Mills. Generals Ord, Wright, andParke made examinations in their fronts to determine the feasibility ofan assault on the enemy's lines.  The two latter reported favorably.The enemy confronting us as he did, at every point from Richmond to ourextreme left, I conceived his lines must be weakly held, and could bepenetrated if my estimate of his forces was correct.  I determined,therefore, to extend our line no farther, but to reinforce GeneralSheridan with a corps of infantry, and thus enable him to cut loose andturn the enemy's right flank, and with the other corps assault theenemy's lines.  The result of the offensive effort of the enemy the weekbefore, when he assaulted Fort Stedman, particularly favored this.  Theenemy's intrenched  picket-line captured by us at that time threw thelines occupied by the belligerents so close together at some points thatit was but a moment's run from one to the other. Preparations were atonce made to relieve General Humphreys's corps, to report to GeneralSheridan; but the condition of the roads prevented immediate movement.On the morning of the 31st, General Warren reported favorably to gettingpossession of the White Oak Road, and was directed to do so.  Toaccomplish this, he moved with one division, instead of his whole corps,which was attacked by the enemy in superior force and driven back on the2d division before it had time to form, and it, in turn, forced backupon the 3d division, when the enemy was checked.  A division of the 2dcorps was immediately sent to his support, the enemy driven back withheavy loss, and possession of the White Oak Road gained.  Sheridanadvanced, and with a portion of his cavalry got possession of the FiveForks; but the enemy, after the affair with the 5th corps, reinforcedthe rebel cavalry, defending that point with infantry, and forced himback towards Dinwiddie Court House.  Here General Sheridan displayedgreat generalship.  Instead of retreating with his whole command on themain army, to tell the story of superior forces encountered, he deployedhis cavalry on foot, leaving only mounted men enough to take charge ofthe horses.  This compelled the enemy to deploy over a vast extent ofwooded and broken country, and made his progress slow.  At this juncturehe dispatched to me what had taken place, and that he was dropping backslowly on Dinwiddie Court House.  General Mackenzie's cavalry and onedivision of the 5th corps were immediately ordered to his assistance.Soon after receiving a report from General Meade that Humphreys couldhold our position on the Boydton Road, and that the other two divisionsof the 5th corps could go to Sheridan, they were so ordered at once.Thus the operations of the day necessitated the sending of Warren,because of his accessibility, instead of Humphreys, as was intended, andprecipitated intended movements.  On the morning of the 1st of April,General Sheridan, reinforced by General Warren, drove the enemy back onFive Forks, where, late in the evening, he assaulted and carried hisstrongly fortified position, capturing all his artillery and betweenfive and six thousand prisoners.About the close of this battle, Brevet Major-General Charles Griffinrelieved Major-General Warren in command of the 5th corps.  The reportof this reached me after nightfall.  Some apprehensions filled my mindlest the enemy might desert his lines during the night, and by fallingupon General Sheridan before assistance could reach him, drive him fromhis position and open the way for retreat.  To guard against this,General Miles's division of Humphreys's corps was sent to reinforce him,and a bombardment was commenced and kept up until four o'clock in themorning (April 2), when an assault was ordered on the enemy's lines.General Wright penetrated the lines with his whole corps, sweepingeverything before him, and to his left towards Hatcher's Run, capturingmany guns and several thousand prisoners.  He was closely followed bytwo divisions of General Ord's command, until he met the other divisionof General Ord's that had succeeded in forcing the enemy's lines nearHatcher's Run. Generals Wright and Ord immediately swung to the right,and closed all of the enemy on that side of them in Petersburg, whileGeneral Humphreys pushed forward with two divisions and joined GeneralWright on the left.  General Parke succeeded in carrying the enemy'smain line, capturing guns and prisoners, but was unable to carry hisinner line.  General Sheridan being advised of the condition of affairs,returned General Miles to his proper command.  On reaching the enemy'slines immediately surrounding Petersburg, a portion of General Gibbon'scorps, by a most gallant charge, captured two strong inclosed works--themost salient and commanding south of Petersburg--thus materiallyshortening the line of investment necessary for taking in the city.  Theenemy south of Hatcher's Run retreated westward to Sutherland's Station,where they were overtaken by Miles's division.  A severe engagementensued, and lasted until both his right and left flanks were threatenedby the approach of General Sheridan, who was moving from Ford's Stationtowards Petersburg, and a division sent by General Meade from the frontof Petersburg, when he broke in the utmost confusion, leaving in ourhands his guns and many prisoners.  This force retreated by the mainroad along the Appomattox River.  During the night of the 2d the enemyevacuated Petersburg and Richmond, and retreated towards Danville.  Onthe morning of the 3d pursuit was commenced.  General Sheridan pushedfor the Danville Road, keeping near the Appomattox, followed by GeneralMeade with the 2d and 6th corps, while General Ord moved forBurkesville, along the South Side Road; the 9th corps stretched alongthat road behind him.  On the 4th, General Sheridan struck the DanvilleRoad near Jetersville, where he learned that Lee was at Amelia CourtHouse.  He immediately intrenched himself and awaited the arrival ofGeneral Meade, who reached there the next day. General Ord reachedBurkesville on the evening of the 5th.On the morning of the 5th, I addressed Major-General Sherman thefollowing communication:'WILSON'S STATION, April 5, 1865.'GENERAL:  All indications now are that Lee will attempt to reachDanville with the remnant of his force.  Sheridan, who was up with himlast night, reports all that is left, horse, foot, and dragoons, attwenty thousand, much demoralized.  We hope to reduce this numberone-half.  I shall push on to Burkesville, and if a stand is made atDanville, will in a very few days go there.  If you can possibly do so,push on from where you are, and let us see if we cannot finish the jobwith Lee's and Johnston's armies.  Whether it will be better for you tostrike for Greensboro', or nearer to Danville, you will be better ableto judge when you receive this.  Rebel armies now are the only strategicpoints to strike at.'U. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General.'MAJOR-GENERAL W. T. SHERMAN.'On the morning of the 6th, it was found that General Lee was moving westof Jetersville, towards Danville.  General Sheridan moved with hiscavalry (the 5th corps having been returned to General Meade on hisreaching Jetersville) to strike his flank, followed by the 6th corps,while the 2d and 5th corps pressed hard after, forcing him to abandonseveral hundred wagons and several pieces of artillery.  General Ordadvanced from Burkesville towards Farmville, sending two regiments ofinfantry and a squadron of cavalry, under Brevet Brigadier-GeneralTheodore Read, to reach and destroy the bridges.  This advance met thehead of Lee's column near Farmville, which it heroically attacked anddetained until General Read was killed and his small force overpowered.This caused a delay in the enemy's movements, and enabled General Ord toget well up with the remainder of his force, on meeting which, the enemyimmediately intrenched himself.  In the afternoon, General Sheridanstruck the enemy south of Sailors' Creek, captured sixteen pieces ofartillery and about four hundred wagons, and detained him until the 6thcorps got up, when a general attack of infantry and cavalry was made,which resulted in the capture of six or seven thousand prisoners, amongwhom were many general officers.  The movements of the 2d corps andGeneral Ord's command contributed greatly to the day's success.On the morning of the 7th the pursuit was renewed, the cavalry, exceptone division, and the 5th corps moving by Prince Edward's Court House;the 6th corps, General Ord's command, and one division of cavalry, onFarmville; and the 2d corps by the High Bridge Road.  It was soon foundthat the enemy had crossed to the north side of the Appomattox; but soclose was the pursuit, that the 2d corps got possession of the commonbridge at High Bridge before the enemy could destroy it, and immediatelycrossed over.  The 6th corps and a division of cavalry crossed atFarmville to its support.Feeling now that General Lee's chance of escape was utterly hopeless, Iaddressed him the following communication from Farmville:'April 7, 1865.'GENERAL--The result of the last week must convince you of thehopelessness of further resistance on the part of the Army of NorthernVirginia in this struggle.  I feel that it is so, and regard it as myduty to shift from myself the responsibility of any further effusion ofblood, by asking of you the surrender of that portion of the ConfederateStates army known as the Army of Northern Virginia.'U. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General.'GENERAL R. E. LEE.'Early on the morning of the 8th, before leaving, I received at Farmvillethe following:'April 7, 1865.'GENERAL:  I have received your note of this date.  Though notentertaining the opinion you express on the hopelessness of furtherresistance on the part of the Army of Northern Virginia, I reciprocateyour desire to avoid useless effusion of blood, and therefore, beforeconsidering your proposition, ask the terms you will offer on conditionof its surrender.'R. E. LEE, General.'LIEUTENANT-GENERAL U. S. GRANT.'To this I immediately replied:'April 8, 1865.'GENERAL:--Your note of last evening, in reply to mine of same date,asking the condition on which I will accept the surrender of the Army ofNorthern Virginia, is just received.  In reply, I would say, that peacebeing my great desire, there is but one condition I would insist upon--namely, That the men and officers surrendered shall be disqualified fortaking up arms again against the Government of the United States untilproperly exchanged.  I will meet you, or will designate officers to meetany officers you may name for the same purpose, at any point agreeableto you, for the purpose of arranging definitely the terms upon which thesurrender of the Army of the Northern Virginia will be received.'U. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General.'GENERAL R. E. LEE.'Early on the morning of the 8th the pursuit was resumed. General Meadefollowed north of the Appomattox, and General Sheridan, with all thecavalry, pushed straight ahead for Appomattox Station, followed byGeneral Ord's command and the 5th corps. During the day General Meade'sadvance had considerable fighting with the enemy's rear-guard, but wasunable to bring on a general engagement.  Late in the evening GeneralSheridan struck the railroad at Appomattox Station, drove the enemy fromthere, and captured twenty-five pieces of artillery, a hospital train,and four trains of cars loaded with supplies for Lee's army.  Duringthis day I accompanied General Meade's column, and about midnightreceived the following communication from General Lee:April 8, 1865.'GENERAL:--I received, at a late hour, your note of to-day.  In mine ofyesterday I did not intend to propose the surrender of the Army ofNorthern Virginia, but to ask the terms of your proposition.  To befrank, I do not think the emergency has arisen to call for the surrenderof this army; but as the restoration of peace should be the sole objectof all, I desired to know whether your proposals would lead to that end.I cannot, therefore, meet you with a view to the surrender of the Armyof Northern Virginia; but as far as your proposal may affect theConfederate States forces under my command, and tend to the restorationof peace, I should be pleased to meet you at ten A.M. to-morrow on theold stage-road to Richmond, between the picket-lines of the two armies.'R. E. LEE, General.'LIEUTENANT-GENERAL U. S. GRANT.'Early on the morning of the 9th I returned him an answer as follows, andimmediately started to join the column south of the Appomattox:'April 9, 1865.'GENERAL:--Your note of yesterday is received.  I have no authority totreat on the subject of peace; the meeting proposed for ten A.M. to-daycould lead to no good.  I will state, however, general, that I amequally anxious for peace with yourself, and the whole North entertainsthe same feeling.  The terms upon which peace can be had are wellunderstood.  By the South laying down their arms they will hasten thatmost desirable event, save thousands of human lives, and hundreds ofmillions of property not yet destroyed.  Seriously hoping that all ourdifficulties may be settled without the loss of another life, Isubscribe myself, etc.'U. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General.'GENERAL R. E. LEE.'On this morning of the 9th, General Ord's command and the 5th corpsreached Appomattox Station just as the enemy was making a desperateeffort to break through our cavalry.  The infantry was at once thrownin.  Soon after a white flag was received, requesting a suspension ofhostilities pending negotiations for a surrender.Before reaching General Sheridan's headquarters, I received thefollowing from General Lee:'April 9, 1865.'GENERAL:--I received your note of this morning on the picket-line,whither I had come to meet you, and ascertain definitely what terms wereembraced in your proposal of yesterday with reference to the surrenderof this army.  I now ask an interview, in accordance with the offercontained in your letter of yesterday, for that purpose.'R. E. LEE, General.'LIEUTENANT-GENERAL U. S. GRANT.'The interview was held at Appomattox Court-House, the result of which isset forth in the following correspondence:APPOMATTOX COURT-HOUSE, Virginia, April 9, 1865.'GENERAL:  In accordance with the substance of my letter to you of the8th instant, I propose to receive the surrender of the Army of NorthernVirginia on the following terms, to wit:  Rolls of all the officers andmen to be made in duplicate, one copy to be given to an officer to bedesignated by me, the other to be retained by such officer or officersas you may designate.  The officers to give their individual paroles notto take up arms against the Government of the United States untilproperly exchanged; and each company or regimental commander sign a likeparole for the men of their commands.  The arms, artillery, and publicproperty to be parked and stacked, and turned over to the officersappointed by me to receive them.  This will not embrace the side-arms ofthe officers, nor their private horses or baggage.  This done, eachofficer and man will be allowed to return to his home, not to bedisturbed by United States authority so long as they observe theirparoles and the laws in force where they may reside.'U. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General.'GENERAL R. E. LEE.''HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF NORTHERN VIRGINIA, April 9, 1865.'GENERAL:  I have received your letter of this date containing the termsof surrender of the Army of Northern Virginia as proposed by you.  Asthey are substantially the same as those expressed in your letter of the8th instant, they are accepted.  I will proceed to designate the properofficers to carry the stipulations into effect.'R. E. LEE, General.'LIEUTENANT-GENERAL U. S. GRANT.'The command of Major-General Gibbon, the 5th army corps under Griffin,and Mackenzie's cavalry, were designated to remain at AppomattoxCourt-House until the paroling of the surrendered army was completed,and to take charge of the public property. The remainder of the armyimmediately returned to the vicinity of Burkesville.General Lee's great influence throughout the whole South caused hisexample to be followed, and to-day the result is that the armies latelyunder his leadership are at their homes, desiring peace and quiet, andtheir arms are in the hands of our ordnance officers.On the receipt of my letter of the 5th, General Sherman moved directlyagainst Joe Johnston, who retreated rapidly on and through Raleigh,which place General Sherman occupied on the morning of the 13th.  Theday preceding, news of the surrender of General Lee reached him atSmithfield.On the 14th a correspondence was opened between General Sherman andGeneral Johnston, which resulted on the 18th in an agreement for asuspension of hostilities, and a memorandum or basis for peace, subjectto the approval of the President.  This agreement was disapproved by thePresident on the 21st, which disapproval, together with yourinstructions, was communicated to General Sherman by me in person on themorning of the 24th, at Raleigh, North Carolina, in obedience to yourorders.  Notice was at once given by him to General Johnston for thetermination of the truce that had been entered into.  On the 25thanother meeting between them was agreed upon, to take place on the 26th,which terminated in the surrender and disbandment of Johnston's armyupon substantially the same terms as were given to General Lee.The expedition under General Stoneman from East Tennessee got off on the20th of March, moving by way of Boone, North Carolina, and struck therailroad at Wytheville, Chambersburg, and Big Lick.  The force strikingit at Big Lick pushed on to within a few miles of Lynchburg, destroyingthe important bridges, while with the main force he effectuallydestroyed it between New River and Big Lick, and then turned forGreensboro', on the North Carolina Railroad; struck that road anddestroyed the bridges between Danville and Greensboro', and betweenGreensboro' and the Yadkin, together with the depots of supplies alongit, and captured four hundred prisoners.  At Salisbury he attacked anddefeated a force of the enemy under General Gardiner, capturing fourteenpieces of artillery and one thousand three hundred and sixty-fourprisoners, and destroyed large amounts of army stores.  At this place hedestroyed fifteen miles of railroad and the bridges towards Charlotte.Thence he moved to Slatersville.General Canby, who had been directed in January to make preparations fora movement from Mobile Bay against Mobile and the interior of Alabama,commenced his movement on the 20th of March.  The 16th corps,Major-General A. J. Smith commanding, moved from Fort Gaines by water toFish River; the 13th corps, under Major-General Gordon Granger, movedfrom Fort Morgan and joined the 16th corps on Fish River, both movingthence on Spanish Fort and investing it on the 27th; while Major-GeneralSteele's command moved from Pensacola, cut the railroad leading fromTensas to Montgomery, effected a junction with them, and partiallyinvested Fort Blakely.  After a severe bombardment of Spanish Fort, apart of its line was carried on the 8th of April.  During the night theenemy evacuated the fort.  Fort Blakely was carried by assault on the9th, and many prisoners captured; our loss was considerable.  Thesesuccesses practically opened to us the Alabama River, and enabled us toapproach Mobile from the north.  On the night of the 11th the city wasevacuated, and was taken possession of by our forces on the morning ofthe 12th.The expedition under command of Brevet Major-General Wilson, consistingof twelve thousand five hundred mounted men, was delayed by rains untilMarch 22d, when it moved from Chickasaw, Alabama.  On the 1st of April,General Wilson encountered the enemy in force under Forrest nearEbenezer Church, drove him in confusion, captured three hundredprisoners and three guns, and destroyed the central bridge over theCahawba River.  On the 2d he attacked and captured the fortified city ofSelma, defended by Forrest, with seven thousand men and thirty-two guns,destroyed the arsenal, armory, naval foundry, machine-shops, vastquantities of stores, and captured three thousand prisoners.  On the 4thhe captured and destroyed Tuscaloosa.  On the 10th he crossed theAlabama River, and after sending information of his operations toGeneral Canby, marched on Montgomery, which place he occupied on the14th, the enemy having abandoned it.  At this place many stores and fivesteamboats fell into our hands.  Thence a force marched direct onColumbus, and another on West Point, both of which places were assaultedand captured on the 16th.  At the former place we got one thousand fivehundred prisoners and fifty-two field-guns, destroyed two gunboats, thenavy yard, foundries, arsenal, many factories, and much other publicproperty.  At the latter place we got three hundred prisoners, fourguns, and destroyed nineteen locomotives and three hundred cars.  On the20th he took possession of Macon, Georgia, with sixty field-guns, onethousand two hundred militia, and five generals, surrendered by GeneralHowell Cobb.  General Wilson, hearing that Jeff. Davis was trying tomake his escape, sent forces in pursuit and succeeded in capturing himon the morning of May 11th.On the 4th day of May, General Dick Taylor surrendered to General Canbyall the remaining rebel forces east of the Mississippi.A force sufficient to insure an easy triumph over the enemy under KirbySmith, west of the Mississippi, was immediately put in motion for Texas,and Major-General Sheridan designated for its immediate command; but onthe 26th day of May, and before they reached their destination, GeneralKirby Smith surrendered his entire command to Major-General Canby.  Thissurrender did not take place, however, until after the capture of therebel President and Vice-President; and the bad faith was exhibited offirst disbanding most of his army and permitting an indiscriminateplunder of public property.Owing to the report that many of those lately in arms against thegovernment had taken refuge upon the soil of Mexico, carrying with themarms rightfully belonging to the United States, which had beensurrendered to us by agreement among them some of the leaders who hadsurrendered in person and the disturbed condition of affairs on the RioGrande, the orders for troops to proceed to Texas were not changed.There have been severe combats, raids, expeditions, and movements todefeat the designs and purposes of the enemy, most of them reflectinggreat credit on our arms, and which contributed greatly to our finaltriumph, that I have not mentioned.  Many of these will be found clearlyset forth in the reports herewith submitted; some in the telegrams andbrief dispatches announcing them, and others, I regret to say, have notas yet been officially reported.For information touching our Indian difficulties, I would respectfullyrefer to the reports of the commanders of departments in which they haveoccurred.It has been my fortune to see the armies of both the West and the Eastfight battles, and from what I have seen I know there is no differencein their fighting qualities.  All that it was possible for men to do inbattle they have done.  The Western armies commenced their battles inthe Mississippi Valley, and received the final surrender of the remnantof the principal army opposed to them in North Carolina.  The armies ofthe East commenced their battles on the river from which the Army of thePotomac derived its name, and received the final surrender of their oldantagonists at Appomattox Court House, Virginia.  The splendidachievements of each have nationalized our victories removed allsectional jealousies (of which we have unfortunately experienced toomuch), and the cause of crimination and recrimination that might havefollowed had either section failed in its duty.  All have a proudrecord, and all sections can well congratulate themselves and each otherfor having done their full share in restoring the supremacy of law overevery foot of territory belonging to the United States.  Let them hopefor perpetual peace and harmony with that enemy, whose manhood, howevermistaken the cause, drew forth such herculean deeds of valor.I have the honor to be, Very respectfully, your obedient servant, U. S.GRANT, Lieutenant-General.THE END
ESFJ	BENJAMIN FRANKLIN was born in Milk Street, Boston, on January6, 1706.  His father, Josiah 
ESFJ	, was a tallow chandler whomarried twice, and of his seventeen children Benjamin was the youngestson.  His schooling ended at ten, and at twelve he was bound apprenticeto his brother James, a printer, who published the 'New EnglandCourant.' To this journal he became a contributor, and later was fora time its nominal editor. But the brothers quarreled, and Benjaminran away, going first to New York, and thence to Philadelphia, wherehe arrived in October, 1723.  He soon obtained work as a printer,but after a few months he was induced by Governor Keith to go toLondon, where, finding Keith's promises empty, he again worked as acompositor till he was brought back to Philadelphia by a merchantnamed  Denman, who gave him a position in his business. On Denman'sdeath he returned to his former trade, and shortly set up a printinghouse of his own from which he published 'The Pennsylvania Gazette,'to which he contributed many essays, and which he made a medium foragitating a variety of local reforms. In 1732 he began to issue hisfamous 'Poor Richard's Almanac' for the enrichment of which he borrowedor composed those pithy utterances of worldly wisdom which are thebasis of a large part of his popular reputation.  In 1758, the yearin which he ceases writing for the Almanac, he printed in it 'FatherAbraham's Sermon,' now regarded as the most famous piece of literatureproduced in Colonial America.Meantime 
ESFJ	 was concerning himself more and more withpublic affairs.  He set forth a scheme for an Academy, which wastaken up later and finally developed into the University of Pennsylvania;and he founded an 'American Philosophical Society' for the purposeof enabling scientific  men to communicate their discoveries to oneanother.  He himself had already begun his electrical researches,which, with other scientific inquiries, he called on in the intervalsof money-making and politics to the end of his life.  In 1748 hesold his business in order to get leisure for study, having nowacquired comparative wealth; and in a few years he had made discoveriesthat gave him a reputation with the learned throughout Europe.  Inpolitics he proved very able both as an administrator and as acontroversialist; but his record as an office-holder is stained bythe use he made of his position to advance his relatives.  His mostnotable service in home politics was his reform of the postal system;but his fame as a statesman rests chiefly on his services in connectionwith the relations of the Colonies with Great Britain, and later withFrance.  In 1757 he was sent to England to protest against theinfluence of the Penns in the government of the colony, and for fiveyears he remained there, striving to enlighten the people and theministry of England as to Colonial conditions.  On his return toAmerica he played an honorable part in the Paxton affair, throughwhich he lost his seat in the Assembly; but in 1764 he was againdespatched to England as agent for the colony, this time to petitionthe King to resume the government from the hands of the proprietors.In London he actively opposed the proposed Stamp Act, but lost thecredit for this and much of his popularity through his securing fora friend the office of stamp agent in America.  Even his effectivework in helping to obtain the repeal of the act left him still asuspect; but he continued his efforts to present the case for theColonies as the troubles thickened toward the crisis of the Revolution.In 1767 he crossed to France, where he was received with honor; butbefore his return home in 1775 he lost his position as postmasterthrough his share in divulging to Massachusetts the famous letter ofHutchinson and Oliver.  On his arrival in Philadelphia he was chosena member of the Continental Congress and in 1777 he was despatchedto France as commissioner for the United States.  Here he remainedtill 1785, the favorite of French society; and with such success didhe conduct the affairs of his country that when he finally returnedhe received a place only second to that of Washington as the championof American independence.  He died on April 17, 1790.The first five chapters of the Autobiography were composed inEngland in 1771, continued in 1784-5, and again in 1788, at whichdate he brought it down to 1757.  After a most extraordinary seriesof adventures, the original form of the manuscript was finally printedby Mr. John Bigelow, and is here reproduced in recognition of itsvalue as a picture of one of the most notable personalities of Colonialtimes, and of its acknowledged rank as one of the great autobiographiesof the world.BENJAMIN FRANKLINHIS AUTOBIOGRAPHY1706-1757TWYFORD, at the Bishop of St. Asaph's,<0>  1771.     <0> The country-seat of Bishop Shipley, the good bishop,         as Dr. 
ESFJ	 used to style him.--B.DEAR SON:  I have ever had pleasure in obtaining any littleanecdotes of my ancestors.  You may remember the inquiries I madeamong the remains of my relations when you were with me in England,and the journey I undertook for that purpose.  Imagining it may beequally agreeable to<1> you to know the circumstances of my life,many of which you are yet unacquainted with, and expecting the enjoymentof a week's uninterrupted leisure in my present country retirement,I sit down to write them for you.  To which I have besides someother inducements.  Having emerged from the poverty and obscurityin which I was born and bred, to a state of affluence and somedegree of reputation in the world, and having gone so far throughlife with a considerable share of felicity, the conducing meansI made use of, which with the blessing of God so well succeeded,my posterity may like to know, as they may find some of themsuitable to their own situations, and therefore fit to be imitated.     <1> After the words 'agreeable to' the words 'some of' were         interlined and afterward effaced.--B.That felicity, when I reflected on it, has induced me sometimesto say, that were it offered to my choice, I should have no objectionto a repetition of the same life from its beginning, only askingthe advantages authors have in a second edition to correct some faultsof the first.  So I might, besides correcting the faults, change somesinister accidents and events of it for others more favorable.But though this were denied, I should still accept the offer.Since such a repetition is not to be expected, the next thingmost like living one's life over again seems to be a recollectionof that life, and to make that recollection as durable as possibleby putting it down in writing.Hereby, too, I shall indulge the inclination so natural in old men,to be talking of themselves and their own past actions; and I shallindulge it without being tiresome to others, who, through respectto age, might conceive themselves obliged to give me a hearing,since this may be read or not as any one pleases.  And, lastly (I mayas well confess it, since my denial of it will be believed by nobody),perhaps I shall a good deal gratify my own vanity.  Indeed, I scarceever heard or saw the introductory words, 'Without vanity I may say,'&c., but some vain thing immediately followed.  Most people dislikevanity in others, whatever share they have of it themselves;but I give it fair quarter wherever I meet with it, being persuadedthat it is often productive of good to the possessor, and to othersthat are within his sphere of action; and therefore, in many cases,it would not be altogether absurd if a man were to thank God for hisvanity among the other comforts of life.And now I speak of thanking God, I desire with all humilityto acknowledge that I owe the mentioned happiness of my pastlife to His kind providence, which lead me to the means I usedand gave them success.  My belief of this induces me to hope,though I must not presume, that the same goodness will still beexercised toward me, in continuing that happiness, or enablingme to bear a fatal reverse, which I may experience as othershave done:  the complexion of my future fortune being knownto Him only in whose power it is to bless to us even our afflictions.The notes one of my uncles (who had the same kind of curiosityin collecting family anecdotes) once put into my hands,furnished me with several particulars relating to our ancestors.From these notes I learned that the family had lived in thesame village, Ecton, in Northamptonshire, for three hundred years,and how much longer he knew not (perhaps from the time when the nameof 
ESFJ	, that before was the name of an order of people,was assumed by them as a surname when others took surnamesall over the kingdom), on a freehold of about thirty acres,aided by the smith's business, which had continued in the familytill his time, the eldest son being always bred to that business;a custom which he and my father followed as to their eldest sons.When I searched the registers at Ecton, I found an accountof their births, marriages and burials from the year 1555 only,there being no registers kept in that parish at any time preceding.By that register I perceived that I was the youngest son of theyoungest son for five generations back.  My grandfather Thomas,who was born in 1598, lived at Ecton till he grew too old tofollow business longer, when he went to live with his son John,a dyer at Banbury, in Oxfordshire, with whom my father servedan apprenticeship.  There my grandfather died and lies buried.We saw his gravestone in 1758.  His eldest son Thomas lived inthe house at Ecton, and left it with the land to his only child,a daughter, who, with her husband, one Fisher, of Wellingborough,sold it to Mr. Isted, now lord of the manor there.  My grandfatherhad four sons that grew up, viz.: Thomas, John, Benjamin and Josiah.I will give you what account I can of them, at this distance frommy papers, and if these are not lost in my absence, you will amongthem find many more particulars.Thomas was bred a smith under his father; but, being ingenious,and encouraged in learning (as all my brothers were) by an EsquirePalmer, then the principal gentleman in that parish, he qualifiedhimself for the business of scrivener; became a considerable manin the county; was a chief mover of all public-spirited undertakingsfor the county or town of Northampton, and his own village,of which many instances were related of him; and much taken noticeof and patronized by the then Lord Halifax.  He died in 1702,January 6, old style, just four years to a day before I was born.The account we received of his life and character from some oldpeople at Ecton, I remember, struck you as something extraordinary,from its similarity to what you knew of mine.'Had he died on the same day,' you said, 'one might have supposeda transmigration.'John was bred a dyer, I believe of woolens.  Benjamin was bred a silkdyer, serving an apprenticeship at London.  He was an ingenious man.I remember him well, for when I was a boy he came over to my fatherin Boston, and lived in the house with us some years.  He livedto a great age.  His grandson, Samuel 
ESFJ	, now lives in Boston.He left behind him two quarto volumes, MS., of his own poetry, consistingof little occasional pieces addressed to his friends and relations,of which the following, sent to me, is a specimen.<2> He had formeda short-hand of his own, which he taught me, but, never practising it,I have now forgot it.  I was named after this uncle, there beinga particular affection between him and my father.  He was very pious,a great attender of sermons of the best preachers, which he tookdown in his short-hand, and had with him many volumes of them.He was also much of a politician; too much, perhaps, for his station.There fell lately into my hands, in London, a collection he hadmade of all the principal pamphlets, relating to public affairs,from 1641 to 1717; many of the volumes are wanting as appearsby the numbering, but there still remain eight volumes in folio,and twenty-four in quarto and in octavo.  A dealer in old booksmet with them, and knowing me by my sometimes buying of him,he brought them to me.  It seems my uncle must have left them here,when he went to America, which was about fifty years since.There are many of his notes in the margins.     <2> Here follow in the margin the words, in brackets, 'here         insert it,' but the poetry is not given.  Mr. Sparks         informs us (Life of 
ESFJ	, p. 6) that these volumes         had been preserved, and were in possession of Mrs. Emmons,         of Boston, great-granddaughter of their author.This obscure family of ours was early in the Reformation,and continued Protestants through the reign of Queen Mary,when they were sometimes in danger of trouble on account of theirzeal against popery.  They had got an English Bible, and to concealand secure it, it was fastened open with tapes under and withinthe cover of a joint-stool. When my great-great-grandfather readit to his family, he turned up the joint-stool upon his knees,turning over the leaves then under the tapes.  One of the childrenstood at the door to give notice if he saw the apparitor coming,who was an officer of the spiritual court.  In that case the stoolwas turned down again upon its feet, when the Bible remained concealedunder it as before.  This anecdote I had from my uncle Benjamin.The family continued all of the Church of England till about the endof Charles the Second's reign, when some of the ministers that had beenouted for nonconformity holding conventicles in Northamptonshire,Benjamin and Josiah adhered to them, and so continued all their lives:the rest of the family remained with the Episcopal Church.Josiah, my father, married young, and carried his wife with threechildren into New England, about 1682.  The conventicles havingbeen forbidden by law, and frequently disturbed, induced someconsiderable men of his acquaintance to remove to that country,and he was prevailed with to accompany them thither, where they expectedto enjoy their mode of religion with freedom.  By the same wife hehad four children more born there, and by a second wife ten more,in all seventeen; of which I remember thirteen sitting at one timeat his table, who all grew up to be men and women, and married;I was the youngest son, and the youngest child but two, and was bornin Boston, New England.  My mother, the second wife, was Abiah Folger,daughter of Peter Folger, one of the first settlers of New England,of whom honorable mention is made by Cotton Mather in his churchhistory of that country, entitled Magnalia Christi Americana,as 'a godly, learned Englishman,' if I remember the words rightly.I have heard that he wrote sundry small occasional pieces,but only one of them was printed, which I saw now many years since.It was written in 1675, in the home-spun verse of that time and people,and addressed to those then concerned in the government there.It was in favor of liberty of conscience, and in behalf of the Baptists,Quakers, and other sectaries that had been under persecution,ascribing the Indian wars, and other distresses that had befallenthe country, to that persecution, as so many judgments of Godto punish so heinous an offense, and exhorting a repeal of thoseuncharitable laws.  The whole appeared to me as written with a gooddeal of decent plainness and manly freedom.  The six concluding linesI remember, though I have forgotten the two first of the stanza;but the purport of them was, that his censures proceeded fromgood-will, and, therefore, he would be known to be the author.          'Because to be a libeller (says he)          I hate it with my heart;          From Sherburne town, where now I dwell          My name I do put here;          Without offense your real friend,          It is Peter Folgier.'My elder brothers were all put apprentices to different trades.I was put to the grammar-school at eight years of age, my fatherintending to devote me, as the tithe of his sons, to the serviceof the Church.  My early readiness in learning to read (which musthave been very early, as I do not remember when I could not read),and the opinion of all his friends, that I should certainly make agood scholar, encouraged him in this purpose of his.  My uncle Benjamin,too, approved of it, and proposed to give me all his short-handvolumes of sermons, I suppose as a stock to set up with, if I wouldlearn his character.  I continued, however, at the grammar-schoolnot quite one year, though in that time I had risen graduallyfrom the middle of the class of that year to be the head of it,and farther was removed into the next class above it, in order to gowith that into the third at the end of the year.  But my father,in the meantime, from a view of the expense of a college education,which having so large a family he could not well afford, and the meanliving many so educated were afterwards able to obtain--reasons thathe gave to his friends in my hearing--altered his first intention,took me from the grammar-school, and sent me to a school for writingand arithmetic, kept by a then famous man, Mr. George Brownell,very successful in his profession generally, and that by mild,encouraging methods.  Under him I acquired fair writing pretty soon,but I failed in the arithmetic, and made no progress in it.At ten years old I was taken home to assist my father in his business,which was that of a tallow-chandler and sope-boiler; a business hewas not bred to, but had assumed on his arrival in New England,and on finding his dying trade would not maintain his family,being in little request.  Accordingly, I was employed in cutting wickfor the candles, filling the dipping mold and the molds for cast candles,attending the shop, going of errands, etc.I disliked the trade, and had a strong inclination for the sea,but my father declared against it; however, living near the water,I was much in and about it, learnt early to swim well, and tomanage boats; and when in a boat or canoe with other boys, I wascommonly allowed to govern, especially in any case of difficulty;and upon other occasions I was generally a leader among the boys,and sometimes led them into scrapes, of which I will mentionone instance, as it shows an early projecting public spirit, tho'not then justly conducted.There was a salt-marsh that bounded part of the mill-pond,on the edge of which, at high water, we used to stand to fishfor minnows.  By much trampling, we had made it a mere quagmire.My proposal was to build a wharff there fit for us to stand upon,and I showed my comrades a large heap of stones, which were intendedfor a new house near the marsh, and which would very well suitour purpose.  Accordingly, in the evening, when the workmenwere gone, I assembled a number of my play-fellows, and workingwith them diligently like so many emmets, sometimes two or threeto a stone, we brought them all away and built our little wharff.The next morning the workmen were surprised at missing the stones,which were found in our wharff.  Inquiry was made after the removers;we were discovered and complained of; several of us were correctedby our fathers; and though I pleaded the usefulness of the work,mine convinced me that nothing was useful which was not honest.I think you may like to know something of his person and character.He had an excellent constitution of body, was of middle stature,but well set, and very strong; he was ingenious, could draw prettily,was skilled a little in music, and had a clear pleasing voice,so that when he played psalm tunes on his violin and sung withal,as he sometimes did in an evening after the business of the day was over,it was extremely agreeable to hear.  He had a mechanical genius too,and, on occasion, was very handy in the use of other tradesmen's tools;but his great excellence lay in a sound understanding and solidjudgment in prudential matters, both in private and publick affairs.In the latter, indeed, he was never employed, the numerousfamily he had to educate and the straitness of his circumstanceskeeping him close to his trade; but I remember well his beingfrequently visited by leading people, who consulted him for hisopinion in affairs of the town or of the church he belonged to,and showed a good deal of respect for his judgment and advice:he was also much consulted by private persons about their affairswhen any difficulty occurred, and frequently chosen an arbitratorbetween contending parties.At his table he liked to have, as often as he could, some sensiblefriend or neighbor to converse with, and always took care to startsome ingenious or useful topic for discourse, which might tendto improve the minds of his children.  By this means he turnedour attention to what was good, just, and prudent in the conductof life; and little or no notice was ever taken of what relatedto the victuals on the table, whether it was well or ill dressed,in or out of season, of good or bad flavor, preferable or inferiorto this or that other thing of the kind, so that I was bro't upin such a perfect inattention to those matters as to be quiteindifferent what kind of food was set before me, and so unobservantof it, that to this day if I am asked I can scarce tell a few hoursafter dinner what I dined upon.  This has been a convenience to mein travelling, where my companions have been sometimes very unhappyfor want of a suitable gratification of their more delicate,because better instructed, tastes and appetites.My mother had likewise an excellent constitution:  she suckledall her ten children.  I never knew either my father or motherto have any sickness but that of which they dy'd, he at 89,and she at 85 years of age.  They lie buried together at Boston,where I some years since placed a marble over their grave,with this inscription:                        JOSIAH FRANKLIN,                               and                         ABIAH his Wife,                       lie here interred.             They lived lovingly together in wedlock                        fifty-five years.          Without an estate, or any gainful employment,                 By constant labor and industry,                      with God's blessing,                 They maintained a large family                          comfortably,                and brought up thirteen children                     and seven grandchildren                           reputably.                   From this instance, reader,           Be encouraged to diligence in thy calling,                  And distrust not Providence.                 He was a pious and prudent man;               She, a discreet and virtuous woman.

A.F. born 1667, died 1752, ----- 95.By my rambling digressions I perceive myself to be grown old.I us'd to write more methodically.  But one does not dress for privatecompany as for a publick ball.  'Tis perhaps only negligence.To return:  I continued thus employed in my father's business fortwo years, that is, till I was twelve years old; and my brother John,who was bred to that business, having left my father, married, and setup for himself at Rhode Island, there was all appearance that Iwas destined to supply his place, and become a tallow-chandler.But my dislike to the trade continuing, my father was underapprehensions that if he did not find one for me more agreeable,I should break away and get to sea, as his son Josiah had done,to his great vexation.  He therefore sometimes took me to walk with him,and see joiners, bricklayers, turners, braziers, etc., at their work,that he might observe my inclination, and endeavor to fix it on sometrade or other on land.  It has ever since been a pleasure to meto see good workmen handle their tools; and it has been useful to me,having learnt so much by it as to be able to do little jobs myselfin my house when a workman could not readily be got, and to constructlittle machines for my experiments, while the intention of makingthe experiment was fresh and warm in my mind.  My father at lastfixed upon the cutler's trade, and my uncle Benjamin's son Samuel,who was bred to that business in London, being about that timeestablished in Boston, I was sent to be with him some time on liking.But his expectations of a fee with me displeasing my father,I was taken home again.From a child I was fond of reading, and all the little moneythat came into my hands was ever laid out in books.  Pleased withthe Pilgrim's Progress, my first collection was of John Bunyan'sworks in separate little volumes.  I afterward sold them to enableme to buy R. Burton's Historical Collections; they were smallchapmen's books, and cheap, 40 or 50 in all.  My father's littlelibrary consisted chiefly of books in polemic divinity, most ofwhich I read, and have since often regretted that, at a time when Ihad such a thirst for knowledge, more proper books had not fallenin my way since it was now resolved I should not be a clergyman.Plutarch's Lives there was in which I read abundantly, and I stillthink that time spent to great advantage.  There was also a book of DeFoe's, called an Essay on Projects, and another of Dr. Mather's,called Essays to do Good, which perhaps gave me a turn of thinkingthat had an influence on some of the principal future events of my life.This bookish inclination at length determined my father to make mea printer, though he had already one son (James) of that profession.In 1717 my brother James returned from England with a press andletters to set up his business in Boston.  I liked it much betterthan that of my father, but still had a hankering for the sea.To prevent the apprehended effect of such an inclination, my fatherwas impatient to have me bound to my brother.  I stood out some time,but at last was persuaded, and signed the indentures when I was yetbut twelve years old.  I was to serve as an apprentice till I wastwenty-one years of age, only I was to be allowed journeyman's wagesduring the last year.  In a little time I made great proficiencyin the business, and became a useful hand to my brother.  I nowhad access to better books.  An acquaintance with the apprenticesof booksellers enabled me sometimes to borrow a small one, which Iwas careful to return soon and clean.  Often I sat up in my roomreading the greatest part of the night, when the book was borrowedin the evening and to be returned early in the morning, lest itshould be missed or wanted.And after some time an ingenious tradesman, Mr. Matthew Adams, who hada pretty collection of books, and who frequented our printing-house,took notice of me, invited me to his library, and very kindly lentme such books as I chose to read.  I now took a fancy to poetry,and made some little pieces; my brother, thinking it might turnto account, encouraged me, and put me on composing occasional ballads.One was called The Lighthouse Tragedy, and contained an accountof the drowning of Captain Worthilake, with his two daughters:the other was a sailor's song, on the taking of Teach (or Blackbeard)the pirate.  They were wretched stuff, in the Grub-street-ballad style;and when they were printed he sent me about the town to sell them.The first sold wonderfully, the event being recent, having madea great noise.  This flattered my vanity; but my father discouragedme by ridiculing my performances, and telling me verse-makerswere generally beggars.  So I escaped being a poet, most probablya very bad one; but as prose writing bad been of great use to mein the course of my life, and was a principal means of my advancement,I shall tell you how, in such a situation, I acquired what littleability I have in that way.There was another bookish lad in the town, John Collins by name,with whom I was intimately acquainted.  We sometimes disputed,and very fond we were of argument, and very desirous of confutingone another, which disputatious turn, by the way, is apt to becomea very bad habit, making people often extremely disagreeable in companyby the contradiction that is necessary to bring it into practice;and thence, besides souring and spoiling the conversation,is productive of disgusts and, perhaps enmities where you may haveoccasion for friendship.  I had caught it by reading my father'sbooks of dispute about religion.  Persons of good sense, I havesince observed, seldom fall into it, except lawyers, university men,and men of all sorts that have been bred at Edinborough.A question was once, somehow or other, started between Collinsand me, of the propriety of educating the female sex in learning,and their abilities for study.  He was of opinion that it was improper,and that they were naturally unequal to it.  I took the contrary side,perhaps a little for dispute's sake.  He was naturally more eloquent,had a ready plenty of words; and sometimes, as I thought, bore medown more by his fluency than by the strength of his reasons.As we parted without settling the point, and were not to see oneanother again for some time, I sat down to put my arguments in writing,which I copied fair and sent to him.  He answered, and I replied.Three or four letters of a side had passed, when my father happenedto find my papers and read them.  Without entering into the discussion,he took occasion to talk to me about the manner of my writing;observed that, though I had the advantage of my antagonist in correctspelling and pointing (which I ow'd to the printing-house), I fellfar short in elegance of expression, in method and in perspicuity,of which he convinced me by several instances.  I saw the justiceof his remark, and thence grew more attentive to the manner in writing,and determined to endeavor at improvement.About this time I met with an odd volume of the Spectator.It was the third.  I had never before seen any of them.  I bought it,read it over and over, and was much delighted with it.  I thoughtthe writing excellent, and wished, if possible, to imitate it.With this view I took some of the papers, and, making short hintsof the sentiment in each sentence, laid them by a few days, and then,without looking at the book, try'd to compleat the papers again,by expressing each hinted sentiment at length, and as fully as ithad been expressed before, in any suitable words that shouldcome to hand.  Then I compared my Spectator with the original,discovered some of my faults, and corrected them.  But I found I wanteda stock of words, or a readiness in recollecting and using them,which I thought I should have acquired before that time if Ihad gone on making verses; since the continual occasion for wordsof the same import, but of different length, to suit the measure,or of different sound for the rhyme, would have laid me under a constantnecessity of searching for variety, and also have tended to fixthat variety in my mind, and make me master of it.  Therefore I tooksome of the tales and turned them into verse; and, after a time,when I had pretty well forgotten the prose, turned them back again.I also sometimes jumbled my collections of hints into confusion,and after some weeks endeavored to reduce them into the best order,before I began to form the full sentences and compleat the paper.This was to teach me method in the arrangement of thoughts.By comparing my work afterwards with the original, I discoveredmany faults and amended them; but I sometimes had the pleasureof fancying that, in certain particulars of small import,I had been lucky enough to improve the method or the language,and this encouraged me to think I might possibly in time come to bea tolerable English writer, of which I was extremely ambitious.My time for these exercises and for reading was at night,after work or before it began in the morning, or on Sundays,when I contrived to be in the printing-house alone, evading as muchas I could the common attendance on public worship which my fatherused to exact on me when I was under his care, and which indeedI still thought a duty, though I could not, as it seemed to me,afford time to practise it.When about 16 years of age I happened to meet with a book,written by one Tryon, recommending a vegetable diet.  I determinedto go into it.  My brother, being yet unmarried, did not keep house,but boarded himself and his apprentices in another family.  My refusingto eat flesh occasioned an inconveniency, and I was frequently chidfor my singularity.  I made myself acquainted with Tryon's mannerof preparing some of his dishes, such as boiling potatoes or rice,making hasty pudding, and a few others, and then proposed to my brother,that if he would give me, weekly, half the money he paid for my board,I would board myself.  He instantly agreed to it, and I presentlyfound that I could save half what he paid me.  This was an additionalfund for buying books.  But I had another advantage in it.My brother and the rest going from the printing-house to their meals,I remained there alone, and, despatching presently my light repast,which often was no more than a bisket or a slice of bread, a handfulof raisins or a tart from the pastry-cook's, and a glass of water,had the rest of the time till their return for study, in which Imade the greater progress, from that greater clearness of headand quicker apprehension which usually attend temperance in eatingand drinking.And now it was that, being on some occasion made asham'd of myignorance in figures, which I had twice failed in learning whenat school, I took Cocker's book of Arithmetick, and went throughthe whole by myself with great ease.  I also read Seller's andShermy's books of Navigation, and became acquainted with the littlegeometry they contain; but never proceeded far in that science.And I read about this time Locke On Human Understanding,and the Art of Thinking, by Messrs.  du Port Royal.While I was intent on improving my language, I met with an Englishgrammar (I think it was Greenwood's), at the end of which there weretwo little sketches of the arts of rhetoric and logic, the latterfinishing with a specimen of a dispute in the Socratic method;and soon after I procur'd Xenophon's Memorable Things of Socrates,wherein there are many instances of the same method.  I wascharm'd with it, adopted it, dropt my abrupt contradiction andpositive argumentation, and put on the humble inquirer and doubter.And being then, from reading Shaftesbury and Collins, become a realdoubter in many points of our religious doctrine, I found this methodsafest for myself and very embarrassing to those against whom I used it;therefore I took a delight in it, practis'd it continually, and grewvery artful and expert in drawing people, even of superior knowledge,into concessions, the consequences of which they did not foresee,entangling them in difficulties out of which they could notextricate themselves, and so obtaining victories that neither myselfnor my cause always deserved.  I continu'd this method some few years,but gradually left it, retaining only the habit of expressing myselfin terms of modest diffidence; never using, when I advanced any thingthat may possibly be disputed, the words certainly, undoubtedly, or anyothers that give the air of positiveness to an opinion; but rather say,I conceive or apprehend a thing to be so and so; it appears to me,or I should think it so or so, for such and such reasons;or I imagine it to be so; or it is so, if I am not mistaken.This habit, I believe, has been of great advantage to me when Ihave had occasion to inculcate my opinions, and persuade men intomeasures that I have been from time to time engag'd in promoting;and, as the chief ends of conversation are to inform or to be informed,to please or to persuade, I wish well-meaning, sensible men wouldnot lessen their power of doing good by a positive, assuming manner,that seldom fails to disgust, tends to create opposition, and todefeat every one of those purposes for which speech was given to us,to wit, giving or receiving information or pleasure.  For, if youwould inform, a positive and dogmatical manner in advancing yoursentiments may provoke contradiction and prevent a candid attention.If you wish information and improvement from the knowledge of others,and yet at the same time express yourself as firmly fix'd in yourpresent opinions, modest, sensible men, who do not love disputation,will probably leave you undisturbed in the possession of your error.And by such a manner, you can seldom hope to recommend yourselfin pleasing your hearers, or to persuade those whose concurrenceyou desire.  Pope says, judiciously:          'Men should be taught as if you taught them not,          And things unknown propos'd as things forgot;'farther recommending to us          'To speak, tho' sure, with seeming diffidence.'And he might have coupled with this line that which he has coupledwith another, I think, less properly,          'For want of modesty is want of sense.'If you ask, Why less properly? I must repeat the lines,          'Immodest words admit of no defense,          For want of modesty is want of sense.'Now, is not want of sense (where a man is so unfortunate as to want it)some apology for his want of modesty? and would not the lines standmore justly thus?          'Immodest words admit but this defense,          That want of modesty is want of sense.'This, however, I should submit to better judgments.My brother had, in 1720 or 1721, begun to print a newspaper.It was the second that appeared in America, and was called the NewEngland Courant.  The only one before it was the Boston News-Letter. Iremember his being dissuaded by some of his friends from the undertaking,as not likely to succeed, one newspaper being, in their judgment,enough for America.  At this time (1771) there are not lessthan five-and-twenty. He went on, however, with the undertaking,and after having worked in composing the types and printing offthe sheets, I was employed to carry the papers thro' the streetsto the customers.He had some ingenious men among his friends, who amus'd themselvesby writing little pieces for this paper, which gain'd it creditand made it more in demand, and these gentlemen often visited us.Hearing their conversations, and their accounts of the approbation theirpapers were received with, I was excited to try my hand among them;but, being still a boy, and suspecting that my brother would objectto printing anything of mine in his paper if he knew it to be mine,I contrived to disguise my hand, and, writing an anonymous paper,I put it in at night under the door of the printing-house. It was foundin the morning, and communicated to his writing friends when theycall'd in as usual.  They read it, commented on it in my hearing, and Ihad the exquisite pleasure of finding it met with their approbation,and that, in their different guesses at the author, none were namedbut men of some character among us for learning and ingenuity.I suppose now that I was rather lucky in my judges, and that perhapsthey were not really so very good ones as I then esteem'd them.Encourag'd, however, by this, I wrote and convey'd in the same wayto the press several more papers which were equally approv'd; and Ikept my secret till my small fund of sense for such performances waspretty well exhausted and then I discovered it, when I began to beconsidered a little more by my brother's acquaintance, and in a mannerthat did not quite please him, as he thought, probably with reason,that it tended to make me too vain.  And, perhaps, this might be oneoccasion of the differences that we began to have about this time.Though a brother, he considered himself as my master, and meas his apprentice, and accordingly, expected the same servicesfrom me as he would from another, while I thought he demean'd metoo much in some he requir'd of me, who from a brother expectedmore indulgence.  Our disputes were often brought before our father,and I fancy I was either generally in the right, or else abetter pleader, because the judgment was generally in my favor.But my brother was passionate, and had often beaten me, which Itook extreamly amiss; and, thinking my apprenticeship very tedious,I was continually wishing for some opportunity of shortening it,which at length offered in a manner unexpected.<3>      <3> I fancy his harsh and tyrannical treatment of me          might be a means of impressing me with that aversion          to arbitrary power that has stuck to me through my          whole life.One of the pieces in our newspaper on some political point, which Ihave now forgotten, gave offense to the Assembly.  He was taken up,censur'd, and imprison'd for a month, by the speaker's warrant,I suppose, because he would not discover his author.  I too was takenup and examin'd before the council; but, tho' I did not give themany satisfaction, they content'd themselves with admonishing me,and dismissed me, considering me, perhaps, as an apprentice, who wasbound to keep his master's secrets.During my brother's confinement, which I resented a good deal,notwithstanding our private differences, I had the managementof the paper; and I made bold to give our rulers some rubs in it,which my brother took very kindly, while others began to considerme in an unfavorable light, as a young genius that had a turnfor libelling and satyr.  My brother's discharge was accompany'dwith an order of the House (a very odd one), that 'James 
ESFJ	should no longer print the paper called the New England Courant.'There was a consultation held in our printing-house amonghis friends, what he should do in this case.  Some proposed toevade the order by changing the name of the paper; but my brother,seeing inconveniences in that, it was finally concluded on as abetter way, to let it be printed for the future under the nameof BENJAMIN FRANKLIN; and to avoid the censure of the Assembly,that might fall on him as still printing it by his apprentice,the contrivance was that my old indenture should be return'd to me,with a full discharge on the back of it, to be shown on occasion,but to secure to him the benefit of my service, I was to sign newindentures for the remainder of the term, which were to be kept private.A very flimsy scheme it was; however, it was immediately executed,and the paper went on accordingly, under my name for several months.At length, a fresh difference arising between my brother and me,I took upon me to assert my freedom, presuming that he would notventure to produce the new indentures.  It was not fair in me totake this advantage, and this I therefore reckon one of the firsterrata of my life; but the unfairness of it weighed little with me,when under the impressions of resentment for the blows his passiontoo often urged him to bestow upon me, though he was otherwisenot an ill-natur'd man:  perhaps I was too saucy and provoking.When he found I would leave him, he took care to prevent my gettingemployment in any other printing-house of the town, by going roundand speaking to every master, who accordingly refus'd to give me work.I then thought of going to New York, as the nearest place wherethere was a printer; and I was rather inclin'd to leave Bostonwhen I reflected that I had already made myself a little obnoxiousto the governing party, and, from the arbitrary proceedings of theAssembly in my brother's case, it was likely I might, if I stay'd,soon bring myself into scrapes; and farther, that my indiscretedisputations about religion began to make me pointed at with horrorby good people as an infidel or atheist.  I determin'd on the point,but my father now siding with my brother, I was sensible that,if I attempted to go openly, means would be used to prevent me.My friend Collins, therefore, undertook to manage a little for me.He agreed with the captain of a New York sloop for my passage,under the notion of my being a young acquaintance of his, that hadgot a naughty girl with child, whose friends would compel me tomarry her, and therefore I could not appear or come away publicly.So I sold some of my books to raise a little money, was taken onboard privately, and as we had a fair wind, in three days I foundmyself in New York, near 300 miles from home, a boy of but 17,without the least recommendation to, or knowledge of any person inthe place, and with very little money in my pocket.My inclinations for the sea were by this time worne out, or Imight now have gratify'd them.  But, having a trade, and supposingmyself a pretty good workman, I offer'd my service to the printerin the place, old Mr. William Bradford, who had been the firstprinter in Pennsylvania, but removed from thence upon the quarrelof George Keith.  He could give me no employment, having little to do,and help enough already; but says he, 'My son at Philadelphiahas lately lost his principal hand, Aquila Rose, by death;if you go thither, I believe he may employ you.'  Philadelphia wasa hundred miles further; I set out, however, in a boat for Amboy,leaving my chest and things to follow me round by sea.In crossing the bay, we met with a squall that tore our rotten sailsto pieces, prevented our getting into the Kill and drove us uponLong Island.  In our way, a drunken Dutchman, who was a passenger too,fell overboard; when he was sinking, I reached through the waterto his shock pate, and drew him up, so that we got him in again.His ducking sobered him a little, and he went to sleep, taking firstout of his pocket a book, which he desir'd I would dry for him.It proved to be my old favorite author, Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress,in Dutch, finely printed on good paper, with copper cuts, a dress betterthan I had ever seen it wear in its own language.  I have since foundthat it has been translated into most of the languages of Europe,and suppose it has been more generally read than any other book,except perhaps the Bible.  Honest John was the first that I knowof who mix'd narration and dialogue; a method of writing very engagingto the reader, who in the most interesting parts finds himself,as it were, brought into the company and present at the discourse.De Foe in his Cruso, his Moll Flanders, Religious Courtship,Family Instructor, and other pieces, has imitated it with success;and Richardson has done the same, in his Pamela, etc.When we drew near the island, we found it was at a place where therecould be no landing, there being a great surff on the stony beach.So we dropt anchor, and swung round towards the shore.  Some peoplecame down to the water edge and hallow'd to us, as we did to them;but the wind was so high, and the surff so loud, that we couldnot hear so as to understand each other.  There were canoes onthe shore, and we made signs, and hallow'd that they should fetch us;but they either did not understand us, or thought it impracticable,so they went away, and night coming on, we had no remedy but to waittill the wind should abate; and, in the meantime, the boatman and Iconcluded to sleep, if we could; and so crowded into the scuttle,with the Dutchman, who was still wet, and the spray beating overthe head of our boat, leak'd thro' to us, so that we were soonalmost as wet as he.  In this manner we lay all night, with verylittle rest; but, the wind abating the next day, we made a shiftto reach Amboy before night, having been thirty hours on the water,without victuals, or any drink but a bottle of filthy rum,and the water we sail'd on being salt.In the evening I found myself very feverish, and went in to bed;but, having read somewhere that cold water drank plentifully was goodfor a fever, I follow'd the prescription, sweat plentiful most ofthe night, my fever left me, and in the morning, crossing the ferry,I proceeded on my journey on foot, having fifty miles to Burlington,where I was told I should find boats that would carry me the restof the way to Philadelphia.It rained very hard all the day; I was thoroughly soak'd, and by noona good deal tired; so I stopt at a poor inn, where I staid all night,beginning now to wish that I had never left home.  I cut so miserablea figure, too, that I found, by the questions ask'd me, I wassuspected to be some runaway servant, and in danger of being takenup on that suspicion.  However, I proceeded the next day, and gotin the evening to an inn, within eight or ten miles of Burlington,kept by one Dr. Brown.  He entered into conversation with me while Itook some refreshment, and, finding I had read a little, became verysociable and friendly.  Our acquaintance continu'd as long as heliv'd. He had been, I imagine, an itinerant doctor, for there was notown in England, or country in Europe, of which he could not givea very particular account.  He had some letters, and was ingenious,but much of an unbeliever, and wickedly undertook, some years after,to travestie the Bible in doggrel verse, as Cotton had done Virgil.By this means he set many of the facts in a very ridiculous light,and might have hurt weak minds if his work had been published;but it never was.At his house I lay that night, and the next morning reach'd Burlington,but had the mortification to find that the regular boats were gonea little before my coming, and no other expected to go before Tuesday,this being Saturday; wherefore I returned to an old woman in the town,of whom I had bought gingerbread to eat on the water, and ask'dher advice.  She invited me to lodge at her house till a passageby water should offer; and being tired with my foot travelling,I accepted the invitation.  She understanding I was a printer,would have had me stay at that town and follow my business,being ignorant of the stock necessary to begin with.  She wasvery hospitable, gave me a dinner of ox-cheek with great good will,accepting only a pot of ale in return; and I thought myselffixed till Tuesday should come.  However, walking in the eveningby the side of the river, a boat came by, which I found was goingtowards Philadelphia, with several people in her.  They took me in,and, as there was no wind, we row'd all the way; and about midnight,not having yet seen the city, some of the company were confidentwe must have passed it, and would row no farther; the others knewnot where we were; so we put toward the shore, got into a creek,landed near an old fence, with the rails of which we made a fire,the night being cold, in October, and there we remained till daylight.Then one of the company knew the place to be Cooper's Creek, a littleabove Philadelphia, which we saw as soon as we got out of the creek,and arriv'd there about eight or nine o'clock on the Sunday morning,and landed at the Market-street wharf.I have been the more particular in this description of my journey,and shall be so of my first entry into that city, that you mayin your mind compare such unlikely beginnings with the figureI have since made there.  I was in my working dress, my bestcloaths being to come round by sea.  I was dirty from my journey;my pockets were stuff'd out with shirts and stockings, and Iknew no soul nor where to look for lodging.  I was fatiguedwith travelling, rowing, and want of rest, I was very hungry;and my whole stock of cash consisted of a Dutch dollar, and abouta shilling in copper.  The latter I gave the people of the boatfor my passage, who at first refus'd it, on account of my rowing;but I insisted on their taking it.  A man being sometimes moregenerous when he has but a little money than when he has plenty,perhaps thro' fear of being thought to have but little.Then I walked up the street, gazing about till near the market-houseI met a boy with bread.  I had made many a meal on bread, and,inquiring where he got it, I went immediately to the baker'she directed me to, in Secondstreet, and ask'd for bisket,intending such as we had in Boston; but they, it seems, were notmade in Philadelphia.  Then I asked for a three-penny loaf,and was told they had none such.  So not considering or knowingthe difference of money, and the greater cheapness nor the namesof his bread, I made him give me three-penny worth of any sort.He gave me, accordingly, three great puffy rolls.  I was surpriz'dat the quantity, but took it, and, having no room in my pockets,walk'd off with a roll under each arm, and eating the other.  Thus Iwent up Market-street as far as Fourth-street, passing by the doorof Mr. Read, my future wife's father; when she, standing at the door,saw me, and thought I made, as I certainly did, a most awkward,ridiculous appearance.  Then I turned and went down Chestnut-street andpart of Walnut-street, eating my roll all the way, and, corning round,found myself again at Market-street wharf, near the boat I came in,to which I went for a draught of the river water; and, being filledwith one of my rolls, gave the other two to a woman and her child thatcame down the river in the boat with us, and were waiting to go farther.Thus refreshed, I walked again up the street, which by this time hadmany clean-dressed people in it, who were all walking the same way.I joined them, and thereby was led into the great meeting-house ofthe Quakers near the market.  I sat down among them, and, after lookinground awhile and hearing nothing said, being very drowsy thro'labor and want of rest the preceding night, I fell fast asleep,and continued so till the meeting broke up, when one was kindenough to rouse me.  This was, therefore, the first house I was in,or slept in, in Philadelphia.Walking down again toward the river, and, looking in the facesof people, I met a young Quaker man, whose countenance I lik'd, and,accosting him, requested he would tell me where a stranger couldget lodging.  We were then near the sign of the Three Mariners.'Here,' says he, 'is one place that entertains strangers, but itis not a reputable house; if thee wilt walk with me, I'll show theea better.'  He brought me to the Crooked Billet in Water-street. HereI got a dinner; and, while I was eating it, several sly questions wereasked me, as it seemed to be suspected from my youth and appearance,that I might be some runaway.After dinner, my sleepiness return'd, and being shown to a bed,I lay down without undressing, and slept till six in the evening,was call'd to supper, went to bed again very early, and sleptsoundly till next morning.  Then I made myself as tidy as I could,and went to Andrew Bradford the printer's. I found in the shopthe old man his father, whom I had seen at New York, and who,travelling on horseback, had got to Philadelphia before me.He introduc'd me to his son, who receiv'd me civilly, gave mea breakfast, but told me he did not at present want a hand,being lately suppli'd with one; but there was another printerin town, lately set up, one Keimer, who, perhaps, might employ me;if not, I should be welcome to lodge at his house, and he wouldgive me a little work to do now and then till fuller businessshould offer.The old gentleman said he would go with me to the new printer;and when we found him, 'Neighbor,' says Bradford, 'I have broughtto see you a young man of your business; perhaps you may want sucha one.'  He ask'd me a few questions, put a composing stick in myhand to see how I work'd, and then said he would employ me soon,though he had just then nothing for me to do; and, taking old Bradford,whom he had never seen before, to be one of the town's people thathad a good will for him, enter'd into a conversation on his presentundertaking and projects; while Bradford, not discovering that hewas the other printer's father, on Keimer's saying he expectedsoon to get the greatest part of the business into his own hands,drew him on by artful questions, and starting little doubts,to explain all his views, what interests he reli'd on, and in whatmanner he intended to proceed.  I, who stood by and heard all,saw immediately that one of them was a crafty old sophister,and the other a mere novice.  Bradford left me with Keimer, who wasgreatly surpris'd when I told him who the old man was.Keimer's printing-house, I found, consisted of an old shatter'd press,and one small, worn-out font of English which he was then using himself,composing an Elegy on Aquila Rose, before mentioned, an ingeniousyoung man, of excellent character, much respected in the town,clerk of the Assembly, and a pretty poet.  Keimer made verses too,but very indifferently.  He could not be said to write them, for hismanner was to compose them in the types directly out of his head.So there being no copy, but one pair of cases, and the Elegylikely to require all the letter, no one could help him.I endeavor'd to put his press (which he had not yet us'd, and ofwhich he understood nothing) into order fit to be work'd with;and, promising to come and print off his Elegy as soon as heshould have got it ready, I return'd to Bradford's, who gave mea little job to do for the present, and there I lodged and dieted,A few days after, Keimer sent for me to print off the Elegy.And now he had got another pair of cases, and a pamphlet to reprint,on which he set me to work.These two printers I found poorly qualified for their business.Bradford had not been bred to it, and was very illiterate;and Keimer, tho' something of a scholar, was a mere compositor,knowing nothing of presswork.  He had been one of the French prophets,and could act their enthusiastic agitations.  At this time he didnot profess any particular religion, but something of all on occasion;was very ignorant of the world, and had, as I afterward found,a good deal of the knave in his composition.  He did not like mylodging at Bradford's while I work'd with him.  He had a house,indeed, but without furniture, so he could not lodge me; but he gotme a lodging at Mr. Read's, before mentioned, who was the ownerof his house; and, my chest and clothes being come by this time,I made rather a more respectable appearance in the eyes of Miss Readthan I had done when she first happen'd to see me eating my roll inthe street.I began now to have some acquaintance among the young people ofthe town, that were lovers of reading, with whom I spent my eveningsvery pleasantly; and gaining money by my industry and frugality,I lived very agreeably, forgetting Boston as much as I could,and not desiring that any there should know where I resided,except my friend Collins, who was in my secret, and kept it when Iwrote to him.  At length, an incident happened that sent me backagain much sooner than I had intended.  I had a brother-in-law,Robert Holmes, master of a sloop that traded between Bostonand Delaware.  He being at Newcastle, forty miles below Philadelphia,heard there of me, and wrote me a letter mentioning the concernof my friends in Boston at my abrupt departure, assuring me of theirgood will to me, and that every thing would be accommodated to mymind if I would return, to which he exhorted me very earnestly.I wrote an answer to his letter, thank'd him for his advice,but stated my reasons for quitting Boston fully and in such a lightas to convince him I was not so wrong as he had apprehended.Sir William Keith, governor of the province, was then at Newcastle,and Captain Holmes, happening to be in company with him when myletter came to hand, spoke to him of me, and show'd him the letter.The governor read it, and seem'd surpris'd when he was told my age.He said I appear'd a young man of promising parts, and thereforeshould be encouraged; the printers at Philadelphia were wretched ones;and, if I would set up there, he made no doubt I should succeed;for his part, he would procure me the public business, and do meevery other service in his power.  This my brother-in-law afterwardstold me in Boston, but I knew as yet nothing of it; when, one day,Keimer and I being at work together near the window, we saw thegovernor and another gentleman (which proved to be Colonel French,of Newcastle), finely dress'd, come directly across the street toour house, and heard them at the door.Keimer ran down immediately, thinking it a visit to him;but the governor inquir'd for me, came up, and with a condescensionof politeness I had been quite unus'd to, made me many compliments,desired to be acquainted with me, blam'd me kindly for nothaving made myself known to him when I first came to the place,and would have me away with him to the tavern, where he was goingwith Colonel French to taste, as he said, some excellent Madeira.I was not a little surprised, and Keimer star'd like a pig poison'd.I went, however, with the governor and Colonel French to a tavern,at the corner of Third-street, and over the Madeira he propos'd mysetting up my business, laid before me the probabilities of success,and both he and Colonel French assur'd me I should have their interestand influence in procuring the public business of both governments.On my doubting whether my father would assist me in it, Sir Williamsaid he would give me a letter to him, in which he would statethe advantages, and he did not doubt of prevailing with him.So it was concluded I should return to Boston in the first vessel,with the governor's letter recommending me to my father.In the mean time the intention was to be kept a secret, and Iwent on working with Keimer as usual, the governor sending for menow and then to dine with him, a very great honor I thought it,and conversing with me in the most affable, familiar, and friendlymanner imaginable.About the end of April, 1724, a little vessel offer'd for Boston.I took leave of Keimer as going to see my friends.  The governor gaveme an ample letter, saying many flattering things of me to my father,and strongly recommending the project of my setting up at Philadelphiaas a thing that must make my fortune.  We struck on a shoal in goingdown the bay, and sprung a leak; we had a blustering time at sea,and were oblig'd to pump almost continually, at which I took my turn.We arriv'd safe, however, at Boston in about a fortnight.  I hadbeen absent seven months, and my friends had heard nothing of me;for my br.  Holmes was not yet return'd, and had not written about me.My unexpected appearance surpriz'd the family; all were, however,very glad to see me, and made me welcome, except my brother.I went to see him at his printing-house. I was better dress'd than everwhile in his service, having a genteel new suit from head to foot,a watch, and my pockets lin'd with near five pounds sterling in silver.He receiv'd me not very frankly, look'd me all over, and turn'd to hiswork again.The journeymen were inquisitive where I had been, what sort of acountry it was, and how I lik'd it.  I prais'd it much, the happylife I led in it, expressing strongly my intention of returningto it; and, one of them asking what kind of money we had there,I produc'd a handful of silver, and spread it before them,which was a kind of raree-show they had not been us'd to, paper beingthe money of Boston.  Then I took an opportunity of letting them seemy watch; and, lastly (my brother still grum and sullen), I gave thema piece of eight to drink, and took my leave.  This visit of mineoffended him extreamly; for, when my mother some time after spoketo him of a reconciliation, and of her wishes to see us on goodterms together, and that we might live for the future as brothers,he said I had insulted him in such a manner before his people thathe could never forget or forgive it.  In this, however, he was mistaken.My father received the governor's letter with some apparent surprise,but said little of it to me for some days, when Capt. Holmes returninghe showed it to him, ask'd him if he knew Keith, and what kind ofman he was; adding his opinion that he must be of small discretionto think of setting a boy up in business who wanted yet three yearsof being at man's estate.  Holmes said what he could in favorof the project, but my father was clear in the impropriety of it,and at last gave a flat denial to it.  Then he wrote a civil letterto Sir William, thanking him for the patronage he had so kindlyoffered me, but declining to assist me as yet in setting up, I being,in his opinion, too young to be trusted with the management of abusiness so important, and for which the preparation must be so expensive.My friend and companion Collins, who was a clerk in the post-office,pleas'd with the account I gave him of my new country, determined togo thither also; and, while I waited for my father's determination,he set out before me by land to Rhode Island, leaving his books,which were a pretty collection of mathematicks and natural philosophy,to come with mine and me to New York, where he propos'd to waitfor me.My father, tho' he did not approve Sir William's proposition,was yet pleas'd that I had been able to obtain so advantageous acharacter from a person of such note where I had resided, and that Ihad been so industrious and careful as to equip myself so handsomelyin so short a time; therefore, seeing no prospect of an accommodationbetween my brother and me, he gave his consent to my returning againto Philadelphia, advis'd me to behave respectfully to the people there,endeavor to obtain the general esteem, and avoid lampooningand libeling, to which he thought I had too much inclination;telling me, that by steady industry and a prudent parsimony I mightsave enough by the time I was one-and-twenty to set me up; and that,if I came near the matter, he would help me out with the rest.This was all I could obtain, except some small gifts as tokensof his and my mother's love, when I embark'd again for New York,now with their approbation and their blessing.The sloop putting in at Newport, Rhode Island, I visited my brother John,who had been married and settled there some years.  He receivedme very affectionately, for he always lov'd me.  A friend of his,one Vernon, having some money due to him in Pensilvania, about thirty-fivepounds currency, desired I would receive it for him, and keep ittill I had his directions what to remit it in.  Accordingly, he gaveme an order.  This afterwards occasion'd me a good deal of uneasiness.At Newport we took in a number of passengers for New York,among which were two young women, companions, and a grave, sensible,matron-like Quaker woman, with her attendants.  I had shown an obligingreadiness to do her some little services, which impress'd her Isuppose with a degree of good will toward me; therefore, when shesaw a daily growing familiarity between me and the two young women,which they appear'd to encourage, she took me aside, and said:'Young man, I am concern'd for thee, as thou has no friend with thee,and seems not to know much of the world, or of the snares youthis expos'd to; depend upon it, those are very bad women; I cansee it in all their actions; and if thee art not upon thy guard,they will draw thee into some danger; they are strangers to thee,and I advise thee, in a friendly concern for thy welfare, to have noacquaintance with them.'  As I seem'd at first not to think so illof them as she did, she mentioned some things she had observ'd andheard that had escap'd my notice, but now convinc'd me she was right.I thank'd her for her kind advice, and promis'd to follow it.When we arriv'd at New York, they told me where they liv'd, and invitedme to come and see them; but I avoided it, and it was well I did;for the next day the captain miss'd a silver spoon and some other things,that had been taken out of his cabbin, and, knowing that these werea couple of strumpets, he got a warrant to search their lodgings,found the stolen goods, and had the thieves punish'd. So, tho'we had escap'd a sunken rock, which we scrap'd upon in the passage,I thought this escape of rather more importance to me.At New York I found my friend Collins, who had arriv'd there some timebefore me.  We had been intimate from children, and had read the samebooks together; but he had the advantage of more time for readingand studying, and a wonderful genius for mathematical learning,in which he far outstript me.  While I liv'd in Boston most of my hoursof leisure for conversation were spent with him, and he continu'da sober as well as an industrious lad; was much respected for hislearning by several of the clergy and other gentlemen, and seemedto promise making a good figure in life.  But, during my absence,he had acquir'd a habit of sotting with brandy; and I found by hisown account, and what I heard from others, that he had been drunkevery day since his arrival at New York, and behav'd very oddly.He had gam'd, too, and lost his money, so that I was oblig'd todischarge his lodgings, and defray his expenses to and at Philadelphia,which prov'd extremely inconvenient to me.The then governor of New York, Burnet (son of Bishop Burnet),hearing from the captain that a young man, one of his passengers,had a great many books, desir'd he would bring me to see him.I waited upon him accordingly, and should have taken Collinswith me but that he was not sober.  The gov'r. treated me withgreat civility, show'd me his library, which was a very large one,and we had a good deal of conversation about books and authors.This was the second governor who had done me the honor to take noticeof me; which, to a poor boy like me, was very pleasing.We proceeded to Philadelphia.  I received on the way Vernon's money,without which we could hardly have finish'd our journey.  Collins wishedto be employ'd in some counting-house, but, whether they discover'dhis dramming by his breath, or by his behaviour, tho' he hadsome recommendations, he met with no success in any application,and continu'd lodging and boarding at the same house with me,and at my expense.  Knowing I had that money of Vernon's, he wascontinually borrowing of me, still promising repayment as soonas he should be in business.  At length he had got so much of itthat I was distress'd to think what I should do in case of beingcall'd on to remit it.His drinking continu'd, about which we sometimes quarrell'd;, for,when a little intoxicated, he was very fractious.  Once, in a boaton the Delaware with some other young men, he refused to rowin his turn.  'I will be row'd home,' says he.  'We will notrow you,' says I. 'You must, or stay all night on the water,'says he, 'just as you please.'  The others said, 'Let us row;what signifies it?'  But, my mind being soured with his other conduct,I continu'd to refuse.  So he swore he would make me row,or throw me overboard; and coming along, stepping on the thwarts,toward me, when he came up and struck at me, I clapped my hand underhis crutch, and, rising, pitched him head-foremost into the river.I knew he was a good swimmer, and so was under little concernabout him; but before he could get round to lay hold of the boat,we had with a few strokes pull'd her out of his reach; and ever when hedrew near the boat, we ask'd if he would row, striking a few strokesto slide her away from him.  He was ready to die with vexation,and obstinately would not promise to row.  However, seeing him at lastbeginning to tire, we lifted him in and brought him home drippingwet in the evening.  We hardly exchang'd a civil word afterwards,and a West India captain, who had a commission to procure a tutorfor the sons of a gentleman at Barbadoes, happening to meet with him,agreed to carry him thither.  He left me then, promising to remit methe first money he should receive in order to discharge the debt;but I never heard of him after.The breaking into this money of Vernon's was one of the first greaterrata of my life; and this affair show'd that my father was not muchout in his judgment when he suppos'd me too young to manage businessof importance.  But Sir William, on reading his letter, said he wastoo prudent.  There was great difference in persons; and discretiondid not always accompany years, nor was youth always without it.'And since he will not set you up,' says he, 'I will do it myself.Give me an inventory of the things necessary to be had from England,and I will send for them.  You shall repay me when you are able;I am resolv'd to have a good printer here, and I am sure youmust succeed.'  This was spoken with such an appearance of cordiality,that I had not the least doubt of his meaning what he said.I had hitherto kept the proposition of my setting up, a secretin Philadelphia, and I still kept it.  Had it been known that Idepended on the governor, probably some friend, that knew him better,would have advis'd me not to rely on him, as I afterwards heard itas his known character to be liberal of promises which he never meantto keep.  Yet, unsolicited as he was by me, how could I think hisgenerous offers insincere?  I believ'd him one of the best men inthe world.I presented him an inventory of a little print'g-house, amountingby my computation to about one hundred pounds sterling.  He lik'd it,but ask'd me if my being on the spot in England to chuse the types,and see that every thing was good of the kind, might not be ofsome advantage.  'Then,' says he, 'when there, you may make acquaintances,and establish correspondences in the bookselling and stationery way.'I agreed that this might be advantageous.  'Then,' says he,'get yourself ready to go with Annis;' which was the annual ship,and the only one at that time usually passing between Londonand Philadelphia.  But it would be some months before Annis sail'd,so I continu'd working with Keimer, fretting about the money Collinshad got from me, and in daily apprehensions of being call'd uponby Vernon, which, however, did not happen for some years after.I believe I have omitted mentioning that, in my first voyagefrom Boston, being becalm'd off Block Island, our people setabout catching cod, and hauled up a great many.  Hitherto I hadstuck to my resolution of not eating animal food, and on thisoccasion consider'd, with my master Tryon, the taking everyfish as a kind of unprovoked murder, since none of them had,or ever could do us any injury that might justify the slaughter.All this seemed very reasonable.  But I had formerly been a greatlover of fish, and, when this came hot out of the frying-pan, itsmelt admirably well.  I balanc'd some time between principleand inclination, till I recollected that, when the fish were opened,I saw smaller fish taken out of their stomachs; then thought I,'If you eat one another, I don't see why we mayn't eat you.'  So Idin'd upon cod very heartily, and continued to eat with other people,returning only now and then occasionally to a vegetable diet.So convenient a thing it is to be a reasonable creature, since itenables one to find or make a reason for everything one has a mindto do.Keimer and I liv'd on a pretty good familiar footing, and agreedtolerably well, for he suspected nothing of my setting up.He retained a great deal of his old enthusiasms and lov'd argumentation.We therefore had many disputations.  I used to work him so with mySocratic method, and had trepann'd him so often by questions apparentlyso distant from any point we had in hand, and yet by degrees leadto the point, and brought him into difficulties and contradictions,that at last he grew ridiculously cautious, and would hardly answerme the most common question, without asking first, 'What do youintend to infer from that?'  However, it gave him so high an opinionof my abilities in the confuting way, that he seriously proposed mybeing his colleague in a project he had of setting up a new sect.He was to preach the doctrines, and I was to confound all opponents.When he came to explain with me upon the doctrines, I found severalconundrums which I objected to, unless I might have my way a little too,and introduce some of mine.Keimer wore his beard at full length, because somewhere in the Mosaiclaw it is said, 'Thou shalt not mar the corners of thy beard.'He likewise kept the Seventh day, Sabbath; and these two points wereessentials with him.  I dislik'd both; but agreed to admit them uponcondition of his adopting the doctrine of using no animal food.'I doubt,' said he, 'my constitution will not bear that.'  I assur'dhim it would, and that he would be the better for it.  He was usually agreat glutton, and I promised myself some diversion in half starving him.He agreed to try the practice, if I would keep him company.I did so, and we held it for three months.  We had our victualsdress'd, and brought to us regularly by a woman in the neighborhood,who had from me a list of forty dishes to be prepar'd for us atdifferent times, in all which there was neither fish, flesh, nor fowl,and the whim suited me the better at this time from the cheapnessof it, not costing us above eighteenpence sterling each per week.I have since kept several Lents most strictly, leaving the commondiet for that, and that for the common, abruptly, without theleast inconvenience, so that I think there is little in the adviceof making those changes by easy gradations.  I went on pleasantly,but poor Keimer suffered grievously, tired of the project,long'd for the flesh-pots of Egypt, and order'd a roast pig.He invited me and two women friends to dine with him; but, it beingbrought too soon upon table, he could not resist the temptation,and ate the whole before we came.I had made some courtship during this time to Miss Read.  I had agreat respect and affection for her, and had some reason to believeshe had the same for me; but, as I was about to take a long voyage,and we were both very young, only a little above eighteen,it was thought most prudent by her mother to prevent our going toofar at present, as a marriage, if it was to take place, would bemore convenient after my return, when I should be, as I expected,set up in my business.  Perhaps, too, she thought my expectationsnot so well founded as I imagined them to be.My chief acquaintances at this time were Charles Osborne, Joseph Watson,and James Ralph, all lovers of reading.  The two first were clerksto an eminent scrivener or conveyancer in the town, Charles Brogden;the other was clerk to a merchant.  Watson was a pious, sensibleyoung man, of great integrity; the others rather more lax in theirprinciples of religion, particularly Ralph, who, as well as Collins,had been unsettled by me, for which they both made me suffer.Osborne was sensible, candid, frank; sincere and affectionateto his friends; but, in literary matters, too fond of criticising.Ralph was ingenious, genteel in his manners, and extremely eloquent;I think I never knew a prettier talker.  Both of them greatadmirers of poetry, and began to try their hands in little pieces.Many pleasant walks we four had together on Sundays into the woods,near Schuylkill, where we read to one another, and conferr'd on whatwe read.Ralph was inclin'd to pursue the study of poetry, not doubtingbut he might become eminent in it, and make his fortune by it,alleging that the best poets must, when they first began to write,make as many faults as he did.  Osborne dissuaded him, assur'd himhe had no genius for poetry, and advis'd him to think of nothingbeyond the business he was bred to; that, in the mercantile way,tho' he had no stock, he might, by his diligence and punctuality,recommend himself to employment as a factor, and in time acquirewherewith to trade on his own account.  I approv'd the amusing one'sself with poetry now and then, so far as to improve one's language,but no farther.On this it was propos'd that we should each of us, at ournext meeting, produce a piece of our own composing, in order toimprove by our mutual observations, criticisms, and corrections.As language and expression were what we had in view, we excludedall considerations of invention by agreeing that the taskshould be a version of the eighteenth Psalm, which describesthe descent of a Deity.  When the time of our meeting drew nigh,Ralph called on me first, and let me know his piece was ready.I told him I had been busy, and, having little inclination,had done nothing.  He then show'd me his piece for my opinion,and I much approv'd it, as it appear'd to me to have great merit.'Now,' says he, 'Osborne never will allow the least merit in anything of mine, but makes 1000 criticisms out of mere envy.  He isnot so jealous of you; I wish, therefore, you would take this piece,and produce it as yours; I will pretend not to have had time,and so produce nothing.  We shall then see what he will say to it.'It was agreed, and I immediately transcrib'd it, that it might appearin my own hand.We met; Watson's performance was read; there were some beautiesin it, but many defects.  Osborne's was read; it was much better;Ralph did it justice; remarked some faults, but applaudedthe beauties.  He himself had nothing to produce.  I was backward;seemed desirous of being excused; had not had sufficient timeto correct, etc.; but no excuse could be admitted; produce I must.It was read and repeated; Watson and Osborne gave up the contest,and join'd in applauding it.  Ralph only made some criticisms,and propos'd some amendments; but I defended my text.  Osborne wasagainst Ralph, and told him he was no better a critic than poet,so he dropt the argument.  As they two went home together,Osborne expressed himself still more strongly in favor of what hethought my production; having restrain'd himself before, as he said,lest I should think it flattery.  'But who would have imagin'd,'said he, 'that 
ESFJ	 had been capable of such a performance;such painting, such force, such fire!  He has even improv'd the original.In his common conversation he seems to have no choice of words;he hesitates and blunders; and yet, good God! how he writes!'When we next met, Ralph discovered the trick we had plaid him,and Osborne was a little laught at.This transaction fixed Ralph in his resolution of becoming a poet.I did all I could to dissuade him from it, but he continuedscribbling verses till Pope cured him.  He became, however, a prettygood prose writer.  More of him hereafter.  But, as I may not haveoccasion again to mention the other two, I shall just remark here,that Watson died in my arms a few years after, much lamented,being the best of our set.  Osborne went to the West Indies,where he became an eminent lawyer and made money, but died young.He and I had made a serious agreement, that the one who happen'dfirst to die should, if possible, make a friendly visit to the other,and acquaint him how he found things in that separate state.  But henever fulfill'd his promise.The governor, seeming to like my company, had me frequently to his house,and his setting me up was always mention'd as a fixed thing.I was to take with me letters recommendatory to a number ofhis friends, besides the letter of credit to furnish me with thenecessary money for purchasing the press and types, paper, etc.For these letters I was appointed to call at different times,when they were to be ready, but a future time was still named.Thus he went on till the ship, whose departure too had been severaltimes postponed, was on the point of sailing.  Then, when I call'dto take my leave and receive the letters, his secretary, Dr. Bard,came out to me and said the governor was extremely busy in writing,but would be down at Newcastle before the ship, and there the letterswould be delivered to me.Ralph, though married, and having one child, had determined toaccompany me in this voyage.  It was thought he intended to establisha correspondence, and obtain goods to sell on commission; but Ifound afterwards, that, thro' some discontent with his wife's relations,he purposed to leave her on their hands, and never return again.Having taken leave of my friends, and interchang'd some promiseswith Miss Read, I left Philadelphia in the ship, which anchor'dat Newcastle.  The governor was there; but when I went to his lodging,the secretary came to me from him with the civillest message inthe world, that he could not then see me, being engaged in businessof the utmost importance, but should send the letters to me on board,wish'd me heartily a good voyage and a speedy return, etc.I returned on board a little puzzled, but still not doubting.Mr. Andrew Hamilton, a famous lawyer of Philadelphia, had takenpassage in the same ship for himself and son, and with Mr. Denham,a Quaker merchant, and Messrs.  Onion and Russel, masters of aniron work in Maryland, had engag'd the great cabin; so that Ralphand I were forced to take up with a berth in the steerage,and none on board knowing us, were considered as ordinary persons.But Mr. Hamilton and his son (it was James, since governor)return'd from Newcastle to Philadelphia, the father being recall'dby a great fee to plead for a seized ship; and, just before wesail'd, Colonel French coming on board, and showing me great respect,I was more taken notice of, and, with my friend Ralph, invited bythe other gentlemen to come into the cabin, there being now room.Accordingly, we remov'd thither.Understanding that Colonel French had brought on board thegovernor's despatches, I ask'd the captain for those lettersthat were to be under my care.  He said all were put into the bagtogether and he could not then come at them; but, before we landedin England, I should have an opportunity of picking them out;so I was satisfied for the present, and we proceeded on our voyage.We had a sociable company in the cabin, and lived uncommonly well,having the addition of all Mr. Hamilton's stores, who had laidin plentifully.  In this passage Mr. Denham contracted a friendshipfor me that continued during his life.  The voyage was otherwisenot a pleasant one, as we had a great deal of bad weather.When we came into the Channel, the captain kept his word with me, and gaveme an opportunity of examining the bag for the governor's letters.I found none upon which my name was put as under my care.  I pickedout six or seven, that, by the handwriting, I thought might be thepromised letters, especially as one of them was directed to Basket,the king's printer, and another to some stationer.  We arriv'din London the 24th of December, 1724.  I waited upon the stationer,who came first in my way, delivering the letter as from Governor Keith.'I don't know such a person,' says he; but, opening the letter, 'O! thisis from Riddlesden.  I have lately found him to be a compleat rascal,and I will have nothing to do with him, nor receive any lettersfrom him.'  So, putting the letter into my hand, he turn'd on hisheel and left me to serve some customer.  I was surprized to findthese were not the governor's letters; and, after recollectingand comparing circumstances, I began to doubt his sincerity.I found my friend Denham, and opened the whole affair to him.He let me into Keith's character; told me there was not the leastprobability that he had written any letters for me; that no one,who knew him, had the smallest dependence on him; and he laught atthe notion of the governor's giving me a letter of credit, having,as he said, no credit to give.  On my expressing some concernabout what I should do, he advised me to endeavor getting someemployment in the way of my business.  'Among the printers here,'said he, 'you will improve yourself, and when you return to America,you will set up to greater advantage.'We both of us happen'd to know, as well as the stationer,that Riddlesden, the attorney, was a very knave.  He had halfruin'd Miss Read's father by persuading him to be bound for him.By this letter it appear'd there was a secret scheme on foot tothe prejudice of Hamilton (suppos'd to be then coming over with us);and that Keith was concerned in it with Riddlesden.  Denham, who wasa friend of Hamilton's thought he ought to be acquainted with it;so, when he arriv'd in England, which was soon after, partly fromresentment and ill-will to Keith and Riddlesden, and partly fromgood-will to him, I waited on him, and gave him the letter.He thank'd me cordially, the information being of importance to him;and from that time he became my friend, greatly to my advantageafterwards on many occasions.But what shall we think of a governor's playing such pitiful tricks,and imposing so grossly on a poor ignorant boy!  It was a habit hehad acquired.  He wish'd to please everybody; and, having littleto give, he gave expectations.  He was otherwise an ingenious,sensible man, a pretty good writer, and a good governor forthe people, tho' not for his constituents, the proprietaries,whose instructions he sometimes disregarded.  Several of our bestlaws were of his planning and passed during his administration.Ralph and I were inseparable companions.  We took lodgingstogether in Little Britain at three shillings and sixpence a week--as much as we could then afford.  He found some relations,but they were poor, and unable to assist him.  He now let me knowhis intentions of remaining in London, and that he never meantto return to Philadelphia.  He had brought no money with him,the whole he could muster having been expended in paying his passage.I had fifteen pistoles; so he borrowed occasionally of me to subsist,while he was looking out for business.  He first endeavored to getinto the playhouse, believing himself qualify'd for an actor;but Wilkes, to whom he apply'd, advis'd him candidly not to thinkof that employment, as it was impossible be should succeed in it.Then he propos'd to Roberts, a publisher in Paternoster Row, to writefor him a weekly paper like the Spectator, on certain conditions,which Roberts did not approve.  Then he endeavored to get employmentas a hackney writer, to copy for the stationers and lawyers aboutthe Temple, but could find no vacancy.I immediately got into work at Palmer's, then a famous printing-housein Bartholomew Close, and here I continu'd near a year.  I waspretty diligent, but spent with Ralph a good deal of my earningsin going to plays and other places of amusement.  We had togetherconsumed all my pistoles, and now just rubbed on from hand to mouth.He seem'd quite to forget his wife and child, and I, by degrees,my engagements with Miss Read, to whom I never wrote more thanone letter, and that was to let her know I was not likely soonto return.  This was another of the great errata of my life,which I should wish to correct if I were to live it over again.In fact, by our expenses, I was constantly kept unable to paymy passage.At Palmer's I was employed in composing for the second editionof Wollaston's 'Religion of Nature.'  Some of his reasoningsnot appearing to me well founded, I wrote a little metaphysicalpiece in which I made remarks on them.  It was entitled 'ADissertation on Liberty and Necessity, Pleasure and Pain.'I inscribed it to my friend Ralph; I printed a small number.It occasion'd my being more consider'd by Mr. Palmer as a youngman of some ingenuity, tho' he seriously expostulated with me uponthe principles of my pamphlet, which to him appear'd abominable.My printing this pamphlet was another erratum.  While I lodg'd inLittle Britain, I made an acquaintance with one Wilcox, a bookseller,whose shop was at the next door.  He had an immense collectionof second-hand books.  Circulating libraries were not then in use;but we agreed that, on certain reasonable terms, which I havenow forgotten, I might take, read, and return any of his books.This I esteem'd a great advantage, and I made as much use of it asI could.My pamphlet by some means falling into the hands of one Lyons, a surgeon,author of a book entitled 'The Infallibility of Human Judgment,'it occasioned an acquaintance between us.  He took great noticeof me, called on me often to converse on those subjects, carried meto the Horns, a pale alehouse in ---- Lane, Cheapside, and introducedme to Dr. Mandeville, author of the 'Fable of the Bees,' who hada club there, of which he was the soul, being a most facetious,entertaining companion.  Lyons, too, introduced me to Dr. Pemberton,at Batson's Coffee-house, who promis'd to give me an opportunity,some time or other, of seeing Sir Isaac Newton, of which I wasextreamely desirous; but this never happened.I had brought over a few curiosities, among which the principalwas a purse made of the asbestos, which purifies by fire.Sir Hans Sloane heard of it, came to see me, and invited me to hishouse in Bloomsbury Square, where he show'd me all his curiosities,and persuaded me to let him add that to the number, for which hepaid me handsomely.In our house there lodg'd a young woman, a milliner, who, I think,had a shop in the Cloisters.  She had been genteelly bred, was sensibleand lively, and of most pleasing conversation.  Ralph read playsto her in the evenings, they grew intimate, she took another lodging,and he followed her.  They liv'd together some time; but, he beingstill out of business, and her income not sufficient to maintainthem with her child, he took a resolution of going from London,to try for a country school, which he thought himself well qualifiedto undertake, as he wrote an excellent hand, and was a masterof arithmetic and accounts.  This, however, he deemed a businessbelow him, and confident of future better fortune, when he shouldbe unwilling to have it known that he once was so meanly employed,he changed his name, and did me the honor to assume mine; for I soonafter had a letter from him, acquainting me that he was settledin a small village (in Berkshire, I think it was, where he taughtreading and writing to ten or a dozen boys, at sixpence each perweek), recommending Mrs. T---- to my care, and desiring me to writeto him, directing for Mr. 
ESFJ	, schoolmaster, at such a place.He continued to write frequently, sending me large specimensof an epic poem which he was then composing, and desiring myremarks and corrections.  These I gave him from time to time,but endeavor'd rather to discourage his proceeding.  One of Young'sSatires was then just published.  I copy'd and sent him a greatpart of it, which set in a strong light the folly of pursuingthe Muses with any hope of advancement by them.  All was in vain;sheets of the poem continued to come by every post.  In the mean time,Mrs. T----, having on his account lost her friends and business,was often in distresses, and us'd to send for me, and borrowwhat I could spare to help her out of them.  I grew fond ofher company, and, being at that time under no religious restraint,and presuming upon my importance to her, I attempted familiarities(another erratum) which she repuls'd with a proper resentment,and acquainted him with my behaviour.  This made a breach between us;and, when he returned again to London, he let me know he thoughtI had cancell'd all the obligations he had been under to me.So I found I was never to expect his repaying me what I lent to him,or advanc'd for him.  This, however, was not then of much consequence,as he was totally unable; and in the loss of his friendship I foundmyself relieved from a burthen.  I now began to think of gettinga little money beforehand, and, expecting better work, I left Palmer'sto work at Watts's, near Lincoln's Inn Fields, a still greaterprinting-house. Here I continued all the rest of my stay in London.At my first admission into this printing-house I took to workingat press, imagining I felt a want of the bodily exercise I had beenus'd to in America, where presswork is mix'd with composing.I drank only water; the other workmen, near fifty in number,were great guzzlers of beer.  On occasion, I carried up and downstairs a large form of types in each hand, when others carriedbut one in both hands.  They wondered to see, from this andseveral instances, that the Water-American, as they called me,was stronger than themselves, who drank strong beer!  We had analehouse boy who attended always in the house to supply the workmen.My companion at the press drank every day a pint before breakfast,a pint at breakfast with his bread and cheese, a pint betweenbreakfast and dinner, a pint at dinner, a pint in the afternoonabout six o'clock, and another when he had done his day's work.I thought it a detestable custom; but it was necessary, he suppos'd,to drink strong beer, that he might be strong to labor.  I endeavoredto convince him that the bodily strength afforded by beer couldonly be in proportion to the grain or flour of the barley dissolvedin the water of which it was made; that there was more flour in apennyworth of bread; and therefore, if he would eat that with a pintof water, it would give him more strength than a quart of beer.He drank on, however, and had four or five shillings to payout of his wages every Saturday night for that muddling liquor;an expense I was free from.  And thus these poor devils keepthemselves always under.Watts, after some weeks, desiring to have me in the composing-room, I leftthe pressmen; a new bien venu or sum for drink, being five shillings,was demanded of me by the compositors.  I thought it an imposition,as I had paid below; the master thought so too, and forbad my paying it.I stood out two or three weeks, was accordingly considered asan excommunicate, and bad so many little pieces of private mischiefdone me, by mixing my sorts, transposing my pages, breaking my matter,etc., etc., if I were ever so little out of the room, and allascribed to the chappel ghost, which they said ever haunted those notregularly admitted, that, notwithstanding the master's protection,I found myself oblig'd to comply and pay the money, convinc'd of thefolly of being on ill terms with those one is to live with continually.I was now on a fair footing with them, and soon acquir'dconsiderable influence.  I propos'd some reasonable alterationsin their chappel<4> laws, and carried them against all opposition.From my example, a great part of them left their muddling breakfastof beer, and bread, and cheese, finding they could with me besuppli'd from a neighboring house with a large porringer of hotwater-gruel, sprinkled with pepper, crumbl'd with bread, and a bitof butter in it, for the price of a pint of beer, viz., threehalf-pence. This was a more comfortable as well as cheaper breakfast,and kept their heads clearer.  Those who continued sotting with beerall day, were often, by not paying, out of credit at the alehouse,and us'd to make interest with me to get beer; their light, as theyphrased it, being out.  I watch'd the pay-table on Saturday night,and collected what I stood engag'd for them, having to pay sometimesnear thirty shillings a week on their account.  This, and my beingesteem'd a pretty good riggite, that is, a jocular verbal satirist,supported my consequence in the society.  My constant attendance(I never making a St. Monday) recommended me to the master;and my uncommon quickness at composing occasioned my being putupon all work of dispatch, which was generally better paid.So I went on now very agreeably.     <4> 'A printing-house is always called a chapel by the         workmen, the origin of which appears to have been that         printing was first carried on in England in an ancient         chapel converted into a printing-house, and the title         has been preserved by tradition.  The bien venu among         the printers answers to the terms entrance and footing         among mechanics; thus a journeyman, on entering a         printing-house, was accustomed to pay one or more gallons         of beer for the good of the chapel;  this custom was         falling into disuse thirty years ago; it is very properly         rejected entirely in the United States.'--W. T. F.My lodging in Little Britain being too remote, I found anotherin Duke-street, opposite to the Romish Chapel.  It was two pairof stairs backwards, at an Italian warehouse.  A widow lady keptthe house; she had a daughter, and a maid servant, and a journeymanwho attended the warehouse, but lodg'd abroad.  After sending to inquiremy character at the house where I last lodg'd she agreed to takeme in at the same rate, 3s.  6d.  per week; cheaper, as she said,from the protection she expected in having a man lodge in the house.She was a widow, an elderly woman; had been bred a Protestant,being a clergyman's daughter, but was converted to the Catholicreligion by her husband, whose memory she much revered; had lived muchamong people of distinction, and knew a thousand anecdotes of themas far back as the times of Charles the Second.  She was lame in herknees with the gout, and, therefore, seldom stirred out of her room,so sometimes wanted company; and hers was so highly amusing to me,that I was sure to spend an evening with her whenever she desired it.Our supper was only half an anchovy each, on a very little stripof bread and butter, and half a pint of ale between us; but theentertainment was in her conversation.  My always keeping good hours,and giving little trouble in the family, made her unwilling to partwith me; so that, when I talk'd of a lodging I had heard of, nearermy business, for two shillings a week, which, intent as I now wason saving money, made some difference, she bid me not think of it,for she would abate me two shillings a week for the future; so Iremained with her at one shilling and sixpence as long as I staidin London.In a garret of her house there lived a maiden lady of seventy,in the most retired manner, of whom my landlady gave me this account:that she was a Roman Catholic, had been sent abroad when young,and lodg'd in a nunnery with an intent of becoming a nun; but,the country not agreeing with her, she returned to England, where,there being no nunnery, she had vow'd to lead the life of a nun,as near as might be done in those circumstances.  Accordingly, she hadgiven all her estate to charitable uses, reserving only twelvepounds a year to live on, and out of this sum she still gave a greatdeal in charity, living herself on water-gruel only, and usingno fire but to boil it.  She had lived many years in that garret,being permitted to remain there gratis by successive Catholic tenantsof the house below, as they deemed it a blessing to have her there.A priest visited her to confess her every day.  'I have ask'd her,'says my landlady, 'how she, as she liv'd, could possibly find so muchemployment for a confessor?'  'Oh,' said she, 'it is impossibleto avoid vain thoughts.'  I was permitted once to visit her, She waschearful and polite, and convers'd pleasantly.  The room was clean,but had no other furniture than a matras, a table with a crucifixand book, a stool which she gave me to sit on, and a pictureover the chimney of Saint Veronica displaying her handkerchief,with the miraculous figure of Christ's bleeding face on it,which she explained to me with great seriousness.  She look'd pale,but was never sick; and I give it as another instance on how smallan income life and health may be supported.At Watts's printing-house I contracted an acquaintance with an ingeniousyoung man, one Wygate, who, having wealthy relations, had been bettereducated than most printers; was a tolerable Latinist, spoke French,and lov'd reading.  I taught him and a friend of his to swim attwice going into the river, and they soon became good swimmers.They introduc'd me to some gentlemen from the country, who went toChelsea by water to see the College and Don Saltero's curiosities.In our return, at the request of the company, whose curiosityWygate had excited, I stripped and leaped into the river, and swamfrom near Chelsea to Blackfryar's, performing on the way many featsof activity, both upon and under water, that surpris'd and pleas'dthose to whom they were novelties.I had from a child been ever delighted with this exercise, had studiedand practis'd all Thevenot's motions and positions, added someof my own, aiming at the graceful and easy as well as the useful.All these I took this occasion of exhibiting to the company,and was much flatter'd by their admiration; and Wygate, who wasdesirous of becoming a master, grew more and more attach'd to meon that account, as well as from the similarity of our studies.He at length proposed to me travelling all over Europe together,supporting ourselves everywhere by working at our business.  I wasonce inclined to it; but, mentioning it to my good friend Mr. Denham,with whom I often spent an hour when I had leisure, he dissuaded mefrom it, advising me to think only of returning to Pennsilvania,which he was now about to do.I must record one trait of this good man's character.  He had formerlybeen in business at Bristol, but failed in debt to a number of people,compounded and went to America.  There, by a close application tobusiness as a merchant, he acquir'd a plentiful fortune in a few years.Returning to England in the ship with me, he invited his old creditorsto an entertainment, at which he thank'd them for the easy compositionthey had favored him with, and, when they expected nothing but the treat,every man at the first remove found under his plate an orderon a banker for the full amount of the unpaid remainder with interest.He now told me he was about to return to Philadelphia, and shouldcarry over a great quantity of goods in order to open a store there.He propos'd to take me over as his clerk, to keep his books,in which he would instruct me, copy his letters, and attendthe store.  He added that, as soon as I should be acquaintedwith mercantile business, he would promote me by sending me witha cargo of flour and bread, etc., to the West Indies, and procureme commissions from others which would be profitable; and, if Imanag'd well, would establish me handsomely.  The thing pleas'd me;for I was grown tired of London, remembered with pleasure the happymonths I had spent in Pennsylvania, and wish'd again to see it;therefore I immediately agreed on the terms of fifty pounds a year,Pennsylvania money; less, indeed, than my present gettings asa compositor, but affording a better prospect.I now took leave of printing, as I thought, for ever, and was dailyemployed in my new business, going about with Mr. Denham amongthe tradesmen to purchase various articles, and seeing them pack'd up,doing errands, calling upon workmen to dispatch, etc.; and, when allwas on board, I had a few days' leisure.  On one of these days,I was, to my surprise, sent for by a great man I knew only by name,a Sir William Wyndham, and I waited upon him.  He had heard by somemeans or other of my swimming from Chelsea to Blackfriar's, and ofmy teaching Wygate and another young man to swim in a few hours.He had two sons, about to set out on their travels; he wish'd to havethem first taught swimming, and proposed to gratify me handsomelyif I would teach them.  They were not yet come to town, and my staywas uncertain, so I could not undertake it; but, from this incident,I thought it likely that, if I were to remain in England and opena swimming-school, I might get a good deal of money; and it struck meso strongly, that, had the overture been sooner made me, probably Ishould not so soon have returned to America.  After many years,you and I had something of more importance to do with one of thesesons of Sir William Wyndham, become Earl of Egremont, which I shallmention in its place.Thus I spent about eighteen months in London; most part of the timeI work'd hard at my business, and spent but little upon myselfexcept in seeing plays and in books.  My friend Ralph had keptme poor; he owed me about twenty-seven pounds, which I was nownever likely to receive; a great sum out of my small earnings!I lov'd him, notwithstanding, for he had many amiable qualities.I had by no means improv'd my fortune; but I had picked up some veryingenious acquaintance, whose conversation was of great advantage to me;and I had read considerably.We sail'd from Gravesend on the 23d of July, 1726.  For the incidentsof the voyage, I refer you to my journal, where you will find themall minutely related.  Perhaps the most important part of thatjournal is the plan<5> to be found in it, which I formed at sea,for regulating my future conduct in life.  It is the more remarkable,as being formed when I was so young, and yet being pretty faithfullyadhered to quite thro' to old age.     <5> The 'Journal' was printed by Sparks, from a copy made         at Reading in 1787.  But it does not contain the Plan.         --Ed.We landed in Philadelphia on the 11th of October, where I foundsundry alterations.  Keith was no longer governor, being supersededby Major Gordon.  I met him walking the streets as a common citizen.He seem'd a little asham'd at seeing me, but pass'd withoutsaying anything.  I should have been as much asham'd at seeingMiss Read, had not her friends, despairing with reason of my returnafter the receipt of my letter, persuaded her to marry another,one Rogers, a potter, which was done in my absence.  With him,however, she was never happy, and soon parted from him, refusing tocohabit with him or bear his name, it being now said that he badanother wife.  He was a worthless fellow, tho' an excellent workman,which was the temptation to her friends.  He got into debt,ran away in 1727 or 1728, went to the West Indies, and died there.Keimer had got a better house, a shop well supply'd with stationery,plenty of new types, a number of hands, tho' none good, and seem'dto have a great deal of business.Mr. Denham took a store in Water-street, where we open'd our goods;I attended the business diligently, studied accounts, and grew,in a little time, expert at selling.  We lodg'd and, boarded together;he counsell'd me as a father, having a sincere regard for me.I respected and lov'd him, and we might have gone on togethervery happy; but, in the beginning of February, 1726-7, when Ihad just pass'd my twenty-first year, we both were taken ill.My distemper was a pleurisy, which very nearly carried me off.I suffered a good deal, gave up the point in my own mind, and wasrather disappointed when I found myself recovering, regretting,in some degree, that I must now, some time or other, have all thatdisagreeable work to do over again.  I forget what his distemper was;it held him a long time, and at length carried him off.  He left mea small legacy in a nuncupative will, as a token of his kindnessfor me, and he left me once more to the wide world; for the storewas taken into the care of his executors, and my employment underhim ended.My brother-in-law, Holmes, being now at Philadelphia, advised my returnto my business; and Keimer tempted me, with an offer of large wagesby the year, to come and take the management of his printing-house,that he might better attend his stationer's shop.  I had heard a badcharacter of him in London from his wife and her friends, and wasnot fond of having any more to do with him.  I tri'd for fartheremployment as a merchant's clerk; but, not readily meeting with any,I clos'd again with Keimer.  I found in his house these hands:Hugh Meredith, a Welsh Pensilvanian, thirty years of age, bred tocountry work; honest, sensible, had a great deal of solid observation,was something of a reader, but given to drink.  Stephen Potts, a youngcountryman of full age, bred to the same, of uncommon natural parts,and great wit and humor, but a little idle.  These he had agreedwith at extream low wages per week, to be rais'd a shilling everythree months, as they would deserve by improving in their business;and the expectation of these high wages, to come on hereafter,was what he had drawn them in with.  Meredith was to work at press,Potts at book-binding, which he, by agreement, was to teach them,though he knew neither one nor t'other. John ----, a wild Irishman,brought up to no business, whose service, for four years, Keimer hadpurchased from the captain of a ship; he, too, was to be madea pressman.  George Webb, an Oxford scholar, whose time for fouryears he had likewise bought, intending him for a compositor,of whom more presently; and David Harry, a country boy, whom he hadtaken apprentice.I soon perceiv'd that the intention of engaging me at wages so muchhigher than he had been us'd to give, was, to have these raw,cheap hands form'd thro' me; and, as soon as I had instructed them,then they being all articled to him, he should be able to do without me.I went on, however, very cheerfully, put his printing-house in order,which had been in great confusion, and brought his hands by degreesto mind their business and to do it better.It was an odd thing to find an Oxford scholar in the situationof a bought servant.  He was not more than eighteen years of age,and gave me this account of himself; that he was born in Gloucester,educated at a grammar-school there, had been distinguish'd amongthe scholars for some apparent superiority in performing his part,when they exhibited plays; belong'd to the Witty Club there,and had written some pieces in prose and verse, which were printedin the Gloucester newspapers; thence he was sent to Oxford; where hecontinued about a year, but not well satisfi'd, wishing of allthings to see London, and become a player.  At length, receiving hisquarterly allowance of fifteen guineas, instead of discharginghis debts he walk'd out of town, hid his gown in a furze bush,and footed it to London, where, having no friend to advise him, he fellinto bad company, soon spent his guineas, found no means of beingintroduc'd among the players, grew necessitous, pawn'd his cloaths,and wanted bread.  Walking the street very hungry, and not knowingwhat to do with himself, a crimp's bill was put into his hand,offering immediate entertainment and encouragement to such as wouldbind themselves to serve in America.He went directly, sign'd the indentures, was put into the ship,and came over, never writing a line to acquaint his friends what wasbecome of him.  He was lively, witty, good-natur'd, and a pleasantcompanion, but idle, thoughtless, and imprudent to the last degree.John, the Irishman, soon ran away; with the rest I began to livevery agreeably, for they all respected me the more, as theyfound Keimer incapable of instructing them, and that from methey learned something daily.  We never worked on Saturday,that being Keimer's Sabbath, so I had two days for reading.My acquaintance with ingenious people in the town increased.Keimer himself treated me with great civility and apparent regard,and nothing now made me uneasy but my debt to Vernon, which Iwas yet unable to pay, being hitherto but a poor oeconomist.He, however, kindly made no demand of it.Our printing-house often wanted sorts, and there was no letter-founderin America; I had seen types cast at James's in London, but withoutmuch attention to the manner; however, I now contrived a mould,made use of the letters we had as puncheons, struck the matricesin lead, And thus supply'd in a pretty tolerable way all deficiencies.I also engrav'd several things on occasion; I made the ink;I was warehouseman, and everything, and, in short, quite a factotum.But, however serviceable I might be, I found that my servicesbecame every day of less importance, as the other hands improv'din the business; and, when Keimer paid my second quarter's wages,he let me know that he felt them too heavy, and thought I shouldmake an abatement.  He grew by degrees less civil, put on more ofthe master, frequently found fault, was captious, and seem'd ready foran outbreaking.  I went on, nevertheless, with a good deal of patience,thinking that his encumber'd circumstances were partly the cause.At length a trifle snapt our connections; for, a great noise happeningnear the court-house, I put my head out of the window to see whatwas the matter.  Keimer, being in the street, look'd up and saw me,call'd out to me in a loud voice and angry tone to mind my business,adding some reproachful words, that nettled me the more fortheir publicity, all the neighbors who were looking out on the sameoccasion being witnesses how I was treated.  He came up immediatelyinto the printing-house, continu'd the quarrel, high words pass'don both sides, he gave me the quarter's warning we had stipulated,expressing a wish that he had not been oblig'd to so long a warning.I told him his wish was unnecessary, for I would leave him that instant;and so, taking my hat, walk'd out of doors, desiring Meredith,whom I saw below, to take care of some things I left, and bringthem to my lodgings.Meredith came accordingly in the evening, when we talked my affair over.He had conceiv'd a great regard for me, and was very unwillingthat I should leave the house while he remain'd in it.  He dissuadedme from returning to my native country, which I began to think of;he reminded me that Keimer was in debt for all he possess'd;that his creditors began to be uneasy; that he kept his shop miserably,sold often without profit for ready money, and often trusted withoutkeeping accounts; that he must therefore fall, which would makea vacancy I might profit of.  I objected my want of money.  He thenlet me know that his father had a high opinion of me, and, from somediscourse that had pass'd between them, he was sure would advancemoney to set us up, if I would enter into partnership with him.'My time,' says he, 'will be out with Keimer in the spring;by that time we may have our press and types in from London.I am sensible I am no workman; if you like it, your skill in thebusiness shall be set against the stock I furnish, and we will sharethe profits equally.'The proposal was agreeable, and I consented; his father was in townand approv'd of it; the more as he saw I had great influence withhis son, had prevail'd on him to abstain long from dram-drinking,and he hop'd might break him off that wretched habit entirely,when we came to be so closely connected.  I gave an inventory tothe father, who carry'd it to a merchant; the things were sent for,the secret was to be kept till they should arrive, and in the meantime I was to get work, if I could, at the other printing-house. But Ifound no vacancy there, and so remain'd idle a few days, when Keimer,on a prospect of being employ'd to print some paper money in New Jersey,which would require cuts and various types that I only could supply,and apprehending Bradford might engage me and get the jobb from him,sent me a very civil message, that old friends should not part for afew words, the effect of sudden passion, and wishing me to return.Meredith persuaded me to comply, as it would give more opportunityfor his improvement under my daily instructions; so I return'd,and we went on more smoothly than for some time before.  The Newjersey jobb was obtain'd, I contriv'd a copperplate press for it,the first that had been seen in the country; I cut several ornamentsand checks for the bills.  We went together to Burlington, where Iexecuted the whole to satisfaction; and he received so large a sumfor the work as to be enabled thereby to keep his head much longerabove water.At Burlington I made an acquaintance with many principal peopleof the province.  Several of them had been appointed by the Assemblya committee to attend the press, and take care that no more billswere printed than the law directed.  They were therefore, by turns,constantly with us, and generally he who attended, brought with hima friend or two for company.  My mind having been much more improv'dby reading than Keimer's, I suppose it was for that reason myconversation seem'd to be more valu'd. They had me to their houses,introduced me to their friends, and show'd me much civility;while he, tho' the master, was a little neglected.  In truth,he was an odd fish; ignorant of common life, fond of rudely opposingreceiv'd opinions, slovenly to extream dirtiness, enthusiastic insome points of religion, and a little knavish withal.We continu'd there near three months; and by that time I couldreckon among my acquired friends, Judge Allen, Samuel Bustill,the secretary of the Province, Isaac Pearson, Joseph Cooper,and several of the Smiths, members of Assembly, and Isaac Decow,the surveyor-general. The latter was a shrewd, sagacious old man,who told me that he began for himself, when young, by wheelingclay for the brick-makers, learned to write after he was of age,carri'd the chain for surveyors, who taught him surveying, and hehad now by his industry, acquir'd a good estate; and says he,'I foresee that you will soon work this man out of business,and make a fortune in it at Philadelphia.'  He had not thenthe least intimation of my intention to set up there or anywhere.These friends were afterwards of great use to me, as I occasionallywas to some of them.  They all continued their regard for me as long asthey lived.Before I enter upon my public appearance in business, it may be wellto let you know the then state of my mind with regard to my principlesand morals, that you may see how far those influenc'd the future eventsof my life.  My parents had early given me religious impressions,and brought me through my childhood piously in the Dissenting way.But I was scarce fifteen, when, after doubting by turns of severalpoints, as I found them disputed in the different books I read,I began to doubt of Revelation itself.  Some books against Deismfell into my hands; they were said to be the substance of sermonspreached at Boyle's Lectures.  It happened that they wroughtan effect on me quite contrary to what was intended by them;for the arguments of the Deists, which were quoted to be refuted,appeared to me much stronger than the refutations; in short,I soon became a thorough Deist.  My arguments perverted some others,particularly Collins and Ralph; but, each of them having afterwardswrong'd me greatly without the least compunction, and recollectingKeith's conduct towards me (who was another freethinker), and my owntowards Vernon and Miss Read, which at times gave me great trouble,I began to suspect that this doctrine, tho' it might be true,was not very useful.  My London pamphlet, which had for its mottothese lines of Dryden:          'Whatever is, is right.  Though purblind man          Sees but a part o' the chain, the nearest link:          His eyes not carrying to the equal beam,          That poises all above;'and from the attributes of God, his infinite wisdom, goodness and power,concluded that nothing could possibly be wrong in the world, and thatvice and virtue were empty distinctions, no such things existing,appear'd now not so clever a performance as I once thought it;and I doubted whether some error had not insinuated itself unperceiv'dinto my argument, so as to infect all that follow'd, as is commonin metaphysical reasonings.I grew convinc'd that truth, sincerity and integrity in dealingsbetween man and man were of the utmost importance to the felicityof life; and I form'd written resolutions, which still remainin my journal book, to practice them ever while I lived.Revelation had indeed no weight with me, as such; but I entertain'dan opinion that, though certain actions might not be bad because theywere forbidden by it, or good because it commanded them, yet probablythese actions might be forbidden because they were bad for us,or commanded because they were beneficial to us, in their own natures,all the circumstances of things considered.  And this persuasion,with the kind hand of Providence, or some guardian angel, or accidentalfavorable circumstances and situations, or all together, preserved me,thro' this dangerous time of youth, and the hazardous situations Iwas sometimes in among strangers, remote from the eye and adviceof my father, without any willful gross immorality or injustice,that might have been expected from my want of religion.  I say willful,because the instances I have mentioned had something of necessityin them, from my youth, inexperience, and the knavery of others.I had therefore a tolerable character to begin the world with;I valued it properly, and determin'd to preserve it.We had not been long return'd to Philadelphia before the new typesarriv'd from London.  We settled with Keimer, and left him by his consentbefore he heard of it.  We found a house to hire near the market,and took it.  To lessen the rent, which was then but twenty-fourpounds a year, tho' I have since known it to let for seventy,we took in Thomas Godfrey, a glazier, and his family, who were topay a considerable part of it to us, and we to board with them.We had scarce opened our letters and put our press in order,before George House, an acquaintance of mine, brought a countrymanto us, whom he had met in the street inquiring for a printer.All our cash was now expended in the variety of particulars wehad been obliged to procure, and this countryman's five shillings,being our first-fruits, and coming so seasonably, gave me more pleasurethan any crown I have since earned; and the gratitude I felt towardHouse has made me often more ready than perhaps I should otherwisehave been to assist young beginners.There are croakers in every country, always boding its ruin.Such a one then lived in Philadelphia; a person of note, an elderly man,with a wise look and a very grave manner of speaking; his namewas Samuel Mickle.  This gentleman, a stranger to me, stopt one dayat my door, and asked me if I was the young man who had latelyopened a new printing-house. Being answered in the affirmative,he said he was sorry for me, because it was an expensive undertaking,and the expense would be lost; for Philadelphia was a sinking place,the people already half-bankrupts, or near being so; all appearancesto the contrary, such as new buildings and the rise of rents,being to his certain knowledge fallacious; for they were, in fact,among the things that would soon ruin us.  And he gave me sucha detail of misfortunes now existing, or that were soon to exist,that he left me half melancholy.  Had I known him before Iengaged in this business, probably I never should have done it.This man continued to live in this decaying place, and to declaimin the same strain, refusing for many years to buy a house there,because all was going to destruction; and at last I had the pleasureof seeing him give five times as much for one as he might have boughtit for when he first began his croaking.I should have mentioned before, that, in the autumn of the preceding year,I had form'd most of my ingenious acquaintance into a club of mutualimprovement, which we called the JUNTO; we met on Friday evenings.The rules that I drew up required that every member, in his turn,should produce one or more queries on any point of Morals, Politics,or Natural Philosophy, to be discuss'd by the company; and oncein three months produce and read an essay of his own writing,on any subject he pleased.  Our debates were to be under the directionof a president, and to be conducted in the sincere spirit of inquiryafter truth, without fondness for dispute, or desire of victory;and, to prevent warmth, all expressions of positiveness in opinions,or direct contradiction, were after some time made contraband,and prohibited under small pecuniary penalties.The first members were Joseph Breintnal, a copyer of deeds forthe scriveners, a good-natur'd, friendly, middle-ag'd man, a greatlover of poetry, reading all he could meet with, and writing somethat was tolerable; very ingenious in many little Nicknackeries,and of sensible conversation.Thomas Godfrey, a self-taught mathematician, great in his way,and afterward inventor of what is now called Hadley's Quadrant.But he knew little out of his way, and was not a pleasing companion;as, like most great mathematicians I have met with, he expecteduniversal precision in everything said, or was for ever denying ordistinguishing upon trifles, to the disturbance of all conversation.He soon left us.Nicholas Scull, a surveyor, afterwards surveyor-general,who lov'd books, and sometimes made a few verses.William Parsons, bred a shoemaker, but loving reading, had acquir'da considerable share of mathematics, which he first studiedwith a view to astrology, that he afterwards laught at it.He also became surveyor-general.William Maugridge, a joiner, a most exquisite mechanic, and a solid,sensible man.Hugh Meredith, Stephen Potts, and George Webb I have characteriz'd before.Robert Grace, a young gentleman of some fortune, generous, lively,and witty; a lover of punning and of his friends.And William Coleman, then a merchant's clerk, about my age, who hadthe coolest, dearest head, the best heart, and the exactest moralsof almost any man I ever met with.  He became afterwards a merchantof great note, and one of our provincial judges.  Our friendshipcontinued without interruption to his death, upward of forty years;and the club continued almost as long, and was the best schoolof philosophy, morality, and politics that then existed in the province;for our queries, which were read the week preceding their discussion,put us upon reading with attention upon the several subjects,that we might speak more to the purpose; and here, too, we acquiredbetter habits of conversation, every thing being studied in ourrules which might prevent our disgusting each other.  From hencethe long continuance of the club, which I shall have frequentoccasion to speak further of hereafter.But my giving this account of it here is to show something of the interestI had, every one of these exerting themselves in recommending businessto us.  Breintnal particularly procur'd us from the Quakers the printingforty sheets of their history, the rest being to be done by Keimer;and upon this we work'd exceedingly hard, for the price was low.It was a folio, pro patria size, in pica, with long primer notes.I compos'd of it a sheet a day, and Meredith worked it off at press;it was often eleven at night, and sometimes later, before I hadfinished my distribution for the next day's work, for the littlejobbs sent in by our other friends now and then put us back.But so determin'd I was to continue doing a sheet a day of the folio,that one night, when, having impos'd my forms, I thought my day'swork over, one of them by accident was broken, and two pagesreduced to pi, I immediately distributed and compos'd it over againbefore I went to bed; and this industry, visible to our neighbors,began to give us character and credit; particularly, I was told,that mention being made of the new printing-office at the merchants'Every-night club, the general opinion was that it must fail,there being already two printers in the place, Keimer and Bradford;but Dr. Baird (whom you and I saw many years after at his native place,St. Andrew's in Scotland) gave a contrary opinion:  'For the industryof that 
ESFJ	,' says he, 'is superior to any thing I ever sawof the kind; I see him still at work when I go home from club,and he is at work again before his neighbors are out of bed.'This struck the rest, and we soon after had offers from one of themto supply us with stationery; but as yet we did not chuse to engage inshop business.I mention this industry the more particularly and the more freely,tho' it seems to be talking in my own praise, that those ofmy posterity, who shall read it, may know the use of that virtue,when they see its effects in my favour throughout this relation.George Webb, who had found a female friend that lent him wherewithto purchase his time of Keimer, now came to offer himself as ajourneyman to us.  We could not then employ him; but I foolishlylet him know as a secret that I soon intended to begin a newspaper,and might then have work for him.  My hopes of success, as I told him,were founded on this, that the then only newspaper, printed by Bradford,was a paltry thing, wretchedly manag'd, no way entertaining, and yetwas profitable to him; I therefore thought a good paper would scarcelyfail of good encouragement.  I requested Webb not to mention it;but he told it to Keimer, who immediately, to be beforehand with me,published proposals for printing one himself, on which Webbwas to be employ'd. I resented this; and, to counteract them,as I could not yet begin our paper, I wrote several pieces ofentertainment for Bradford's paper, under the title of the BUSY BODY,which Breintnal continu'd some months.  By this means the attentionof the publick was fixed on that paper, and Keimer's proposals,which we burlesqu'd and ridicul'd, were disregarded.  He beganhis paper, however, and, after carrying it on three quarters ofa year, with at most only ninety subscribers, he offered it to mefor a trifle; and I, having been ready some time to go on with it,took it in hand directly; and it prov'd in a few years extremelyprofitable to me.I perceive that I am apt to speak in the singular number,though our partnership still continu'd; the reason may be that,in fact, the whole management of the business lay upon me.Meredith was no compositor, a poor pressman, and seldom sober.My friends lamented my connection with him, but I was to make the bestof it.Our first papers made a quite different appearance from any beforein the province; a better type, and better printed; but some spiritedremarks of my writing, on the dispute then going on between GovernorBurnet and the Massachusetts Assembly, struck the principal people,occasioned the paper and the manager of it to be much talk'd of,and in a few weeks brought them all to be our subscribers.Their example was follow'd by many, and our number went ongrowing continually.  This was one of the first good effects of myhaving learnt a little to scribble; another was, that the leading men,seeing a newspaper now in the hands of one who could also handlea pen, thought it convenient to oblige and encourage me.Bradford still printed the votes, and laws, and other publick business.He had printed an address of the House to the governor, in a coarse,blundering manner, we reprinted it elegantly and correctly,and sent one to every member.  They were sensible of the difference:it strengthened the hands of our friends in the House, and theyvoted us their printers for the year ensuing.Among my friends in the House I must not forget Mr. Hamilton,before mentioned, who was then returned from England, and had a seatin it.  He interested himself for me strongly in that instance,as he did in many others afterward, continuing his patronage tillhis death.<6>     <6> I got his son once L500.--[Marg. note.]Mr. Vernon, about this time, put me in mind of the debt I ow'd him,but did not press me.  I wrote him an ingenuous letter of acknowledgment,crav'd his forbearance a little longer, which he allow'd me,and as soon as I was able, I paid the principal with interest,and many thanks; so that erratum was in some degree corrected.But now another difficulty came upon me which I had never the leastreason to expect.  Mr. Meredith's father, who was to have paid forour printing-house, according to the expectations given me, was ableto advance only one hundred pounds currency, which had been paid;and a hundred more was due to the merchant, who grew impatient,and su'd us all.  We gave bail, but saw that, if the money couldnot be rais'd in time, the suit must soon come to a judgmentand execution, and our hopeful prospects must, with us, be ruined,as the press and letters must be sold for payment, perhaps athalf price.In this distress two true friends, whose kindness I have never forgotten,nor ever shall forget while I can remember any thing, came tome separately, unknown to each other, and, without any applicationfrom me, offering each of them to advance me all the money that shouldbe necessary to enable me to take the whole business upon myself,if that should be practicable; but they did not like my continuingthe partnership with Meredith, who, as they said, was often seendrunk in the streets, and playing at low games in alehouses, much toour discredit.  These two friends were William Coleman and Robert Grace.I told them I could not propose a separation while any prospectremain'd of the Merediths' fulfilling their part of our agreement,because I thought myself under great obligations to them for what theyhad done, and would do if they could; but, if they finally fail'din their performance, and our partnership must be dissolv'd, I shouldthen think myself at liberty to accept the assistance of my friends.Thus the matter rested for some time, when I said to my partner,'Perhaps your father is dissatisfied at the part you have undertakenin this affair of ours, and is unwilling to advance for you andme what he would for you alone.  If that is the case, tell me,and I will resign the whole to you, and go about my business.''No,' said he, 'my father has really been disappointed, and isreally unable; and I am unwilling to distress him farther.I see this is a business I am not fit for.  I was bred a farmer,and it was a folly in me to come to town, and put myself, at thirtyyears of age, an apprentice to learn a new trade.  Many of our Welshpeople are going to settle in North Carolina, where land is cheap.I am inclin'd to go with them, and follow my old employment.You may find friends to assist you.  If you will take the debtsof the company upon you; return to my father the hundred pound hehas advanced; pay my little personal debts, and give me thirtypounds and a new saddle, I will relinquish the partnership,and leave the whole in your hands.'  I agreed to this proposal:it was drawn up in writing, sign'd, and seal'd immediately.I gave him what he demanded, and he went soon after to Carolina,from whence he sent me next year two long letters, containing thebest account that had been given of that country, the climate,the soil, husbandry, etc., for in those matters he was very judicious.I printed them in the papers, and they gave great satisfaction tothe publick.As soon as he was gone, I recurr'd to my two friends; and because Iwould not give an unkind preference to either, I took half ofwhat each had offered and I wanted of one, and half of the other;paid off the company's debts, and went on with the businessin my own name, advertising that the partnership was dissolved.I think this was in or about the year 1729.About this time there was a cry among the people for more paper money,only fifteen thousand pounds being extant in the province, and that soonto be sunk.  The wealthy inhabitants oppos'd any addition, being againstall paper currency, from an apprehension that it would depreciate,as it had done in New England, to the prejudice of all creditors.We had discuss'd this point in our Junto, where I was on the sideof an addition, being persuaded that the first small sum struck in 1723had done much good by increasing the trade, employment, and numberof inhabitants in the province, since I now saw all the old housesinhabited, and many new ones building; whereas I remembered well,that when I first walk'd about the streets of Philadelphia,eating my roll, I saw most of the houses in Walnut-street, betweenSecond and Front streets, with bills on their doors, 'To be let';and many likewise in Chestnut-street and other streets, which made me thenthink the inhabitants of the city were deserting it one after another.Our debates possess'd me so fully of the subject, that I wroteand printed an anonymous pamphlet on it, entitled 'The Nature andNecessity of a Paper Currency.'  It was well receiv'd by the commonpeople in general; but the rich men dislik'd it, for it increas'dand strengthen'd the clamor for more money, and they happening to haveno writers among them that were able to answer it, their oppositionslacken'd, and the point was carried by a majority in the House.My friends there, who conceiv'd I had been of some service,thought fit to reward me by employing me in printing the money;a very profitable jobb and a great help to me.  This was anotheradvantage gain'd by my being able to write.The utility of this currency became by time and experience so evident asnever afterwards to be much disputed; so that it grew soon to fifty-fivethousand pounds, and in 1739 to eighty thousand pounds, since which itarose during war to upwards of three hundred and fifty thousand pounds,trade, building, and inhabitants all the while increasing, tillI now think there are limits beyond which the quantity may be hurtful.I soon after obtain'd, thro' my friend Hamilton, the printing of theNewcastle paper money, another profitable jobb as I then thought it;small things appearing great to those in small circumstances;and these, to me, were really great advantages, as they weregreat encouragements.  He procured for me, also, the printingof the laws and votes of that government, which continu'din my hands as long as I follow'd the business.I now open'd a little stationer's shop.  I had in it blanks ofall sorts, the correctest that ever appear'd among us, being assistedin that by my friend Breintnal.  I had also paper, parchment,chapmen's books, etc.  One Whitemash, a compositor I had known in London,an excellent workman, now came to me, and work'd with me constantlyand diligently; and I took an apprentice, the son of Aquila Rose.I began now gradually to pay off the debt I was under for theprinting-house. In order to secure my credit and character as a tradesman,I took care not only to be in reality industrious and frugal,but to avoid all appearances to the contrary.  I drest plainly;I was seen at no places of idle diversion.  I never went out a fishingor shooting; a book, indeed, sometimes debauch'd me from my work,but that was seldom, snug, and gave no scandal; and, to show that Iwas not above my business, I sometimes brought home the paperI purchas'd at the stores thro' the streets on a wheelbarrow.Thus being esteem'd an industrious, thriving young man, and payingduly for what I bought, the merchants who imported stationerysolicited my custom; others proposed supplying me with books,and I went on swimmingly.  In the mean time, Keimer's creditand business declining daily, he was at last forc'd to sell hisprinting house to satisfy his creditors.  He went to Barbadoes,and there lived some years in very poor circumstances.His apprentice, David Harry, whom I had instructed while I work'dwith him, set up in his place at Philadelphia, having boughthis materials.  I was at first apprehensive of a powerful rivalin Harry, as his friends were very able, and had a good dealof interest.  I therefore propos'd a partner-ship to him which he,fortunately for me, rejected with scorn.  He was very proud,dress'd like a gentleman, liv'd expensively, took much diversionand pleasure abroad, ran in debt, and neglected his business;upon which, all business left him; and, finding nothing to do,he followed Keimer to Barbadoes, taking the printing-house with him.There this apprentice employ'd his former master as a journeyman;they quarrel'd often; Harry went continually behindhand, and atlength was forc'd to sell his types and return to his country workin Pensilvania.  The person that bought them employ'd Keimer to use them,but in a few years he died.There remained now no competitor with me at Philadelphia but theold one, Bradford; who was rich and easy, did a little printingnow and then by straggling hands, but was not very anxiousabout the business.  However, as he kept the post-office, it wasimagined he had better opportunities of obtaining news; his paperwas thought a better distributer of advertisements than mine,and therefore had many, more, which was a profitable thing to him,and a disadvantage to me; for, tho' I did indeed receive and sendpapers by the post, yet the publick opinion was otherwise, for whatI did send was by bribing the riders, who took them privately,Bradford being unkind enough to forbid it, which occasion'd someresentment on my part; and I thought so meanly of him for it, that,when I afterward came into his situation, I took care never to imitate it.I had hitherto continu'd to board with Godfrey, who lived in partof my house with his wife and children, and had one side of the shopfor his glazier's business, tho' he worked little, being alwaysabsorbed in his mathematics.  Mrs. Godfrey projected a match for mewith a relation's daughter, took opportunities of bringing us oftentogether, till a serious courtship on my part ensu'd, the girl beingin herself very deserving.  The old folks encourag'd me by continualinvitations to supper, and by leaving us together, till at lengthit was time to explain.  Mrs. Godfrey manag'd our little treaty.I let her know that I expected as much money with their daughteras would pay off my remaining debt for the printing-house, which Ibelieve was not then above a hundred pounds.  She brought me wordthey had no such sum to spare; I said they might mortgage theirhouse in the loan-office. The answer to this, after some days, was,that they did not approve the match; that, on inquiry of Bradford,they had been inform'd the printing business was not a profitable one;the types would soon be worn out, and more wanted; that S. Keimerand D. Harry had failed one after the other, and I should probablysoon follow them; and, therefore, I was forbidden the house,and the daughter shut up.Whether this was a real change of sentiment or only artifice,on a supposition of our being too far engaged in affection to retract,and therefore that we should steal a marriage, which would leavethem at liberty to give or withhold what they pleas'd, I know not;but I suspected the latter, resented it, and went no more.Mrs. Godfrey brought me afterward some more favorable accounts oftheir disposition, and would have drawn me on again; but I declaredabsolutely my resolution to have nothing more to do with that family.This was resented by the Godfreys; we differ'd, and they removed,leaving me the whole house, and I resolved to take no more inmates.But this affair having turned my thoughts to marriage, I look'dround me and made overtures of acquaintance in other places;but soon found that, the business of a printer being generallythought a poor one, I was not to expect money with a wife,unless with such a one as I should not otherwise think agreeable.In the mean time, that hard-to-be-governed passion of youth hurriedme frequently into intrigues with low women that fell in my way,which were attended with some expense and great inconvenience,besides a continual risque to my health by a distemper which ofall things I dreaded, though by great good luck I escaped it.A friendly correspondence as neighbors and old acquaintanceshad continued between me and Mrs. Read's family, who all had aregard for me from the time of my first lodging in their house.I was often invited there and consulted in their affairs,wherein I sometimes was of service.  I piti'd poor Miss Read'sunfortunate situation, who was generally dejected, seldom cheerful,and avoided company.  I considered my giddiness and inconstancywhen in London as in a great degree the cause of her unhappiness,tho' the mother was good enough to think the fault more her ownthan mine, as she had prevented our marrying before I went thither,and persuaded the other match in my absence.  Our mutual affectionwas revived, but there were now great objections to our union.The match was indeed looked upon as invalid, a preceding wife beingsaid to be living in England; but this could not easily be prov'd,because of the distance; and, tho' there was a report of his death,it was not certain.  Then, tho' it should be true, he had leftmany debts, which his successor might be call'd upon to pay.We ventured, however, over all these difficulties, and I took herto wife, September 1st, 1730.  None of the inconveniences happenedthat we had apprehended, she proved a good and faithful helpmate,assisted me much by attending the shop; we throve together, and haveever mutually endeavored to make each other happy.  Thus I correctedthat great erratum as well as I could.About this time, our club meeting, not at a tavern, but in a littleroom of Mr. Grace's, set apart for that purpose, a propositionwas made by me, that, since our books were often referr'd to in ourdisquisitions upon the queries, it might be convenient to us to have themaltogether where we met, that upon occasion they might be consulted;and by thus clubbing our books to a common library, we should,while we lik'd to keep them together, have each of us the advantageof using the books of all the other members, which would be nearlyas beneficial as if each owned the whole.  It was lik'd and agreed to,and we fill'd one end of the room with such books as we couldbest spare.  The number was not so great as we expected; and tho'they had been of great use, yet some inconveniences occurringfor want of due care of them, the collection, after about a year,was separated, and each took his books home againAnd now I set on foot my first project of a public nature, that fora subscription library.  I drew up the proposals, got them put intoform by our great scrivener, Brockden, and, by the help of my friendsin the Junto, procured fifty subscribers of forty shillings eachto begin with, and ten shillings a year for fifty years, the termour company was to continue.  We afterwards obtain'd a charter,the company being increased to one hundred:  this was the motherof all the North American subscription libraries, now so numerous.It is become a great thing itself, and continually increasing.These libraries have improved the general conversation of the Americans,made the common tradesmen and farmers as intelligent as most gentlemenfrom other countries, and perhaps have contributed in some degreeto the stand so generally made throughout the colonies in defenseof their privileges.Memo.  Thus far was written with the intention express'd in the beginningand therefore contains several little family anecdotes of no importanceto others.  What follows was written many years after in compliancewith the advice contain'd in these letters, and accordingly intended forthe public.  The affairs of the Revolution occasion'd the interruption.     Letter from Mr. Abel James, with Notes of my Life                    (received in Paris).'MY DEAR AND HONORED FRIEND:  I have often been desirous ofwriting to thee, but could not be reconciled to the thought thatthe letter might fall into the hands of the British, lest someprinter or busy-body should publish some part of the contents,and give our friend pain, and myself censure.'Some time since there fell into my hands, to my great joy,about twenty-three sheets in thy own handwriting, containing anaccount of the parentage and life of thyself, directed to thy son,ending in the year 1730, with which there were notes, likewise inthy writing; a copy of which I inclose, in hopes it may be a means,if thou continued it up to a later period, that the first and latterpart may be put together; and if it is not yet continued, I hope theewill not delay it.

ESFJ	 should leave his friends and the world deprived of so pleasingand profitable a work; a work which would be useful and entertainingnot only to a few, but to millions?  The influence writings underthat class have on the minds of youth is very great, and has nowhereappeared to me so plain, as in our public friend's journals.It almost insensibly leads the youth into the resolution of endeavoringto become as good and eminent as the journalist.  Should thine,for instance, when published (and I think it could not fail ofit), lead the youth to equal the industry and temperance of thyearly youth, what a blessing with that class would such a work be!I know of no character living, nor many of them put together,who has so much in his power as thyself to promote a greater spiritof industry and early attention to business, frugality, and temperancewith the American youth.  Not that I think the work would have noother merit and use in the world, far from it; but the first isof such vast importance that I know nothing that can equal it.'The foregoing letter and the minutes accompanying it being shownto a friend, I received from him the following:     Letter from Mr. Benjamin Vaughan.                                 'PARIS, January 31, 1783.'My DEAREST SIR:  When I had read over your sheets of minutesof the principal incidents of your life, recovered for you by yourQuaker acquaintance, I told you I would send you a letter expressingmy reasons why I thought it would be useful to complete and publishit as he desired.  Various concerns have for some time past preventedthis letter being written, and I do not know whether it was worthany expectation; happening to be at leisure, however, at present,I shall by writing, at least interest and instruct myself; but as theterms I am inclined to use may tend to offend a person of your manners,I shall only tell you how I would address any other person,who was as good and as great as yourself, but less diffident.I would say to him, Sir, I solicit the history of your lifefrom the following motives:  Your history is so remarkable,that if you do not give it, somebody else will certainly give it;and perhaps so as nearly to do as much harm, as your own managementof the thing might do good.  It will moreover present a tableof the internal circumstances of your country, which will verymuch tend to invite to it settlers of virtuous and manly minds.And considering the eagerness with which such information is soughtby them, and the extent of your reputation, I do not know of amore efficacious advertisement than your biography would give.All that has happened to you is also connected with the detailof the manners and situation of a rising people; and in thisrespect I do not think that the writings of Caesar and Tacitus canbe more interesting to a true judge of human nature and society.But these, sir, are small reasons, in my opinion, compared withthe chance which your life will give for the forming of futuregreat men; and in conjunction with your Art of Virtue (which youdesign to publish) of improving the features of private character,and consequently of aiding all happiness, both public and domestic.The two works I allude to, sir, will in particular give a noblerule and example of self-education. School and other educationconstantly proceed upon false principles, and show a clumsyapparatus pointed at a false mark; but your apparatus is simple,and the mark a true one; and while parents and young personsare left destitute of other just means of estimating and becomingprepared for a reasonable course in life, your discovery thatthe thing is in many a man's private power, will be invaluable!Influence upon the private character, late in life, is not onlyan influence late in life, but a weak influence.  It is in youththat we plant our chief habits and prejudices; it is in youththat we take our party as to profession, pursuits and matrimony.In youth, therefore, the turn is given; in youth the education evenof the next generation is given; in youth the private and publiccharacter is determined; and the term of life extending but from youthto age, life ought to begin well from youth, and more especiallybefore we take our party as to our principal objects.  But yourbiography will not merely teach self-education, but the educationof a wise man; and the wisest man will receive lights and improvehis progress, by seeing detailed the conduct of another wise man.And why are weaker men to be deprived of such helps, when we seeour race has been blundering on in the dark, almost without a guidein this particular, from the farthest trace of time?  Show then,sir, how much is to be done, both to sons and fathers; and inviteall wise men to become like yourself, and other men to become wise.When we see how cruel statesmen and warriors can be to the human race,and how absurd distinguished men can be to their acquaintance,it will be instructive to observe the instances multiply of pacific,acquiescing manners; and to find how compatible it is to be greatand domestic, enviable and yet good-humored.'The little private incidents which you will also have to relate,will have considerable use, as we want, above all things, rules ofprudence in ordinary affairs; and it will be curious to see how youhave acted in these.  It will be so far a sort of key to life,and explain many things that all men ought to have once explainedto them, to give, them a chance of becoming wise by foresight.The nearest thing to having experience of one's own, is to have otherpeople's affairs brought before us in a shape that is interesting;this is sure to happen from your pen; our affairs and management willhave an air of simplicity or importance that will not fail to strike;and I am convinced you have conducted them with as much originalityas if you had been conducting discussions in politics or philosophy;and what more worthy of experiments and system (its importance and itserrors considered) than human life?'Some men have been virtuous blindly, others have speculatedfantastically, and others have been shrewd to bad purposes;but you, sir, I am sure, will give under your hand, nothing butwhat is at the same moment, wise, practical and good, your accountof yourself (for I suppose the parallel I am drawing for Dr. 
ESFJ	,will hold not only in point of character, but of private history)will show that you are ashamed of no origin; a thing the more important,as you prove how little necessary all origin is to happiness, virtue,or greatness.  As no end likewise happens without a means, so weshall find, sir, that even you yourself framed a plan by which youbecame considerable; but at the same time we may see that thoughthe event is flattering, the means are as simple as wisdom couldmake them; that is, depending upon nature, virtue, thought andhabit. Another thing demonstrated will be the propriety of everyman'swaiting for his time for appearing upon the stage of the world.Our sensations being very much fixed to the moment, we are apt toforget that more moments are to follow the first, and consequentlythat man should arrange his conduct so as to suit the whole of a life.Your attribution appears to have been applied to your life, and thepassing moments of it have been enlivened with content and enjoymentinstead of being tormented with foolish impatience or regrets.Such a conduct is easy for those who make virtue and themselvesin countenance by examples of other truly great men, of whompatience is so often the characteristic.  Your Quaker correspondent,sir (for here again I will suppose the subject of my letter resemblingDr. 
ESFJ	), praised your frugality, diligence and temperance,which he considered as a pattern for all youth; but it is singularthat he should have forgotten your modesty and your disinterestedness,without which you never could have waited for your advancement,or found your situation in the mean time comfortable; which isa strong lesson to show the poverty of glory and the importanceof regulating our minds.  If this correspondent had known the natureof your reputation as well as I do, he would have said, Your formerwritings and measures would secure attention to your Biography,and Art of Virtue; and your Biography and Art of Virtue, in return,would secure attention to them.  This is an advantage attendant upona various character, and which brings all that belongs to it intogreater play; and it is the more useful, as perhaps more personsare at a loss for the means of improving their minds and characters,than they are for the time or the inclination to do it.  But thereis one concluding reflection, sir, that will shew the use of your lifeas a mere piece of biography.  This style of writing seems a littlegone out of vogue, and yet it is a very useful one; and your specimenof it may be particularly serviceable, as it will make a subject ofcomparison with the lives of various public cutthroats and intriguers,and with absurd monastic self-tormentors or vain literary triflers.If it encourages more writings of the same kind with your own,and induces more men to spend lives fit to be written, it will beworth all Plutarch's Lives put together.  But being tired of figuringto myself a character of which every feature suits only one man inthe world, without giving him the praise of it, I shall end my letter,my dear Dr. 
ESFJ	, with a personal application to your proper self.I am earnestly desirous, then, my dear sir, that you should let theworld into the traits of your genuine character, as civil broils nayotherwise tend to disguise or traduce it.  Considering your great age,the caution of your character, and your peculiar style of thinking,it is not likely that any one besides yourself can be sufficientlymaster of the facts of your life, or the intentions of your mind.Besides all this, the immense revolution of the present period,will necessarily turn our attention towards the author of it,and when virtuous principles have been pretended in it, it will behighly important to shew that such have really influenced; and, as yourown character will be the principal one to receive a scrutiny,it is proper (even for its effects upon your vast and rising country,as well as upon England and upon Europe) that it should standrespectable and eternal.  For the furtherance of human happiness,I have always maintained that it is necessary to prove thatman is not even at present a vicious and detestable animal;and still more to prove that good management may greatly amend him;and it is for much the same reason, that I am anxious to seethe opinion established, that there are fair characters existingamong the individuals of the race; for the moment that all men,without exception, shall be conceived abandoned, good people willcease efforts deemed to be hopeless, and perhaps think of takingtheir share in the scramble of life, or at least of making itcomfortable principally for themselves.  Take then, my dear sir,this work most speedily into hand:  shew yourself good as you are good;temperate as you are temperate; and above all things, prove yourselfas one, who from your infancy have loved justice, liberty and concord,in a way that has made it natural and consistent for you to have acted,as we have seen you act in the last seventeen years of your life.Let Englishmen be made not only to respect, but even to love you.When they think well of individuals in your native country,they will go nearer to thinking well of your country; and when yourcountrymen see themselves well thought of by Englishmen, they will gonearer to thinking well of England.  Extend your views even further;do not stop at those who speak the English tongue, but after havingsettled so many points in nature and politics, think of betteringthe whole race of men.  As I have not read any part of the lifein question, but know only the character that lived it, I writesomewhat at hazard.  I am sure, however, that the life and the treatiseI allude to (on the Art of Virtue) will necessarily fulfil the chiefof my expectations; and still more so if you take up the measureof suiting these performances to the several views above stated.Should they even prove unsuccessful in all that a sanguine admirerof yours hopes from them, you will at least have framed piecesto interest the human mind; and whoever gives a feeling of pleasurethat is innocent to man, has added so much to the fair side of a lifeotherwise too much darkened by anxiety and too much injured by pain.In the hope, therefore, that you will listen to the prayer addressedto you in this letter, I beg to subscribe myself, my dearest sir,etc., etc.,     'Signed, BENJ.  VAUGHAN.'Continuation of the Account of my Life, begun at Passy, near Paris, 1784.It is some time since I receiv'd the above letters, but I have beentoo busy till now to think of complying with the request they contain.It might, too, be much better done if I were at home among my papers,which would aid my memory, and help to ascertain dates; but myreturn being uncertain and having just now a little leisure, I willendeavor to recollect and write what I can; if I live to get home,it may there be corrected and improv'd.Not having any copy here of what is already written, I knownot whether an account is given of the means I used to establishthe Philadelphia public library, which, from a small beginning,is now become so considerable, though I remember to have comedown to near the time of that transaction (1730). I will thereforebegin here with an account of it, which may be struck out if foundto have been already given.At the time I establish'd myself in Pennsylvania, there was not a goodbookseller's shop in any of the colonies to the southward of Boston.In New York and Philad'a the printers were indeed stationers; they soldonly paper, etc., almanacs, ballads, and a few common school-books. Thosewho lov'd reading were oblig'd to send for their books from England;the members of the Junto had each a few.  We had left the alehouse,where we first met, and hired a room to hold our club in.I propos'd that we should all of us bring our books to that room,where they would not only be ready to consult in our conferences,but become a common benefit, each of us being at liberty to borrowsuch as he wish'd to read at home.  This was accordingly done,and for some time contented us.Finding the advantage of this little collection, I propos'd torender the benefit from books more common, by commencing a publicsubscription library.  I drew a sketch of the plan and rules that wouldbe necessary, and got a skilful conveyancer, Mr. Charles Brockden,to put the whole in form of articles of agreement to be subscribed,by which each subscriber engag'd to pay a certain sum down for the firstpurchase of books, and an annual contribution for increasing them.So few were the readers at that time in Philadelphia, and the majorityof us so poor, that I was not able, with great industry, to findmore than fifty persons, mostly young tradesmen, willing to pay downfor this purpose forty shillings each, and ten shillings per annum.On this little fund we began.  The books were imported; the librarywag opened one day in the week for lending to the subscribers,on their promissory notes to pay double the value if not duly returned.The institution soon manifested its utility, was imitated byother towns, and in other provinces.  The libraries were augmentedby donations; reading became fashionable; and our people,having no publick amusements to divert their attention from study,became better acquainted with books, and in a few years wereobserv'd by strangers to be better instructed and more intelligentthan people of the same rank generally are in other countries.When we were about to sign the above-mentioned articles, which wereto be binding upon us, our heirs, etc., for fifty years, Mr. Brockden,the scrivener, said to us, 'You are young men, but it is scarcelyprobable that any of you will live to see the expiration of the termfix'd in the instrument.'  A number of us, however, are yet living;but the instrument was after a few years rendered null by a charterthat incorporated and gave perpetuity to the company.The objections and reluctances I met with in soliciting the subscriptions,made me soon feel the impropriety of presenting one's self as theproposer of any useful project, that might be suppos'd to raise one'sreputation in the smallest degree above that of one's neighbors,when one has need of their assistance to accomplish that project.I therefore put myself as much as I could out of sight, and statedit as a scheme of a number of friends, who had requested me to goabout and propose it to such as they thought lovers of reading.In this way my affair went on more smoothly, and I ever afterpractis'd it on such occasions; and, from my frequent successes,can heartily recommend it.  The present little sacrifice of yourvanity will afterwards be amply repaid.  If it remains a whileuncertain to whom the merit belongs, some one more vain thanyourself will be encouraged to claim it, and then even envy willbe disposed to do you justice by plucking those assumed feathers,and restoring them to their right owner.This library afforded me the means of improvement by constant study,for which I set apart an hour or two each day, and thus repair'din some degree the loss of the learned education my father onceintended for me.  Reading was the only amusement I allow'd myself.I spent no time in taverns, games, or frolicks of any kind;and my industry in my business continu'd as indefatigableas it was necessary.  I was indebted for my printing-house;I had a young family coming on to be educated, and I had to contendwith for business two printers, who were established in the placebefore me.  My circumstances, however, grew daily easier.My original habits of frugality continuing, and my father having,among his instructions to me when a boy, frequently repeated a proverbof Solomon, 'Seest thou a man diligent in his calling, he shall standbefore kings, he shall not stand before mean men,' I from thenceconsidered industry as a means of obtaining wealth and distinction,which encourag'd me, tho' I did not think that I should everliterally stand before kings, which, however, has since happened;for I have stood before five, and even had the honor of sittingdown with one, the King of Denmark, to dinner.We have an English proverb that says, 'He that would thrive, must askhis wife.'  It was lucky for me that I had one as much dispos'dto industry and frugality as myself.  She assisted me cheerfullyin my business, folding and stitching pamphlets, tending shop,purchasing old linen rags for the papermakers, etc., etc.  We keptno idle servants, our table was plain and simple, our furnitureof the cheapest.  For instance, my breakfast was a long time breadand milk (no tea), and I ate it out of a twopenny earthen porringer,with a pewter spoon.  But mark how luxury will enter families,and make a progress, in spite of principle:  being call'd one morningto breakfast, I found it in a China bowl, with a spoon of silver!They had been bought for me without my knowledge by my wife,and had cost her the enormous sum of three-and-twenty shillings,for which she had no other excuse or apology to make, but that shethought her husband deserv'd a silver spoon and China bowl as wellas any of his neighbors.  This was the first appearance of plateand China in our house, which afterward, in a course of years,as our wealth increas'd, augmented gradually to several hundred poundsin value.I had been religiously educated as a Presbyterian; and tho'some of the dogmas of that persuasion, such as the eternal decreesof God, election, reprobation, etc., appeared to me unintelligible,others doubtful, and I early absented myself from the publicassemblies of the sect, Sunday being my studying day, I never waswithout some religious principles.  I never doubted, for instance,the existence of the Deity; that he made the world, and govern'dit by his Providence; that the most acceptable service of God wasthe doing good to man; that our souls are immortal; and that all crimewill be punished, and virtue rewarded, either here or hereafter.These I esteem'd the essentials of every religion; and, being tobe found in all the religions we had in our country, I respectedthem all, tho' with different degrees of respect, as I found themmore or less mix'd with other articles, which, without any tendencyto inspire, promote, or confirm morality, serv'd principallyto divide us, and make us unfriendly to one another.  This respectto all, with an opinion that the worst had some good effects,induc'd me to avoid all discourse that might tend to lessenthe good opinion another might have of his own religion; and asour province increas'd in people, and new places of worship werecontinually wanted, and generally erected by voluntary contributions,my mite for such purpose, whatever might be the sect, was never refused.Tho' I seldom attended any public worship, I had still an opinionof its propriety, and of its utility when rightly conducted,and I regularly paid my annual subscription for the support ofthe only Presbyterian minister or meeting we had in Philadelphia.He us'd to visit me sometimes as a friend, and admonish meto attend his administrations, and I was now and then prevail'don to do so, once for five Sundays successively.  Had he beenin my opinion a good preacher, perhaps I might have continued,notwithstanding the occasion I had for the Sunday's leisure in mycourse of study; but his discourses were chiefly either polemicarguments, or explications of the peculiar doctrines of our sect,and were all to me very dry, uninteresting, and unedifying,since not a single moral principle was inculcated or enforc'd, theiraim seeming to be rather to make us Presbyterians than good citizens.At length he took for his text that verse of the fourth chapterof Philippians, 'Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true,honest, just, pure, lovely, or of good report, if there be any virtue,or any praise, think on these things.'  And I imagin'd, in a sermonon such a text, we could not miss of having some morality.But he confin'd himself to five points only, as meant by the apostle,viz.: 1.  Keeping holy the Sabbath day.  2.  Being diligent in readingthe holy Scriptures.  3.  Attending duly the publick worship.4.  Partaking of the Sacrament.  5.  Paying a due respect toGod's ministers.  These might be all good things; but, as theywere not the kind of good things that I expected from that text,I despaired of ever meeting with them from any other, was disgusted,and attended his preaching no more.  I had some years before compos'da little Liturgy, or form of prayer, for my own private use (viz.,in 1728), entitled, Articles of Belief and Acts of Religion.I return'd to the use of this, and went no more to the public assemblies.My conduct might be blameable, but I leave it, without attemptingfurther to excuse it; my present purpose being to relate facts,and not to make apologies for them.It was about this time I conceiv'd the bold and arduous projectof arriving at moral perfection.  I wish'd to live withoutcommitting any fault at any time; I would conquer all that eithernatural inclination, custom, or company might lead me into.  As I knew,or thought I knew, what was right and wrong, I did not see why Imight not always do the one and avoid the other.  But I soon foundI had undertaken a task of more difficulty than I bad imagined.While my care was employ'd in guarding against one fault, I wasoften surprised by another; habit took the advantage of inattention;inclination was sometimes too strong for reason.  I concluded, at length,that the mere speculative conviction that it was our interest to becompletely virtuous, was not sufficient to prevent our slipping;and that the contrary habits must be broken, and good ones acquiredand established, before we can have any dependence on a steady,uniform rectitude of conduct.  For this purpose I therefore contrivedthe following method.In the various enumerations of the moral virtues I had metwith in my reading, I found the catalogue more or less numerous,as different writers included more or fewer ideas under the same name.Temperance, for example, was by some confined to eating and drinking,while by others it was extended to mean the moderating everyother pleasure, appetite, inclination, or passion, bodily or mental,even to our avarice and ambition.  I propos'd to myself, for the sakeof clearness, to use rather more names, with fewer ideas annex'dto each, than a few names with more ideas; and I included underthirteen names of virtues all that at that time occurr'd to meas necessary or desirable, and annexed to each a short precept,which fully express'd the extent I gave to its meaning.These names of virtues, with their precepts, were:1.  TEMPERANCE.  Eat not to dullness; drink not to elevation.2.  SILENCE.  Speak not but what may benefit others or yourself;avoid trifling conversation.3.  ORDER.  Let all your things have their places; let each partof your business have its time.4.  RESOLUTION.  Resolve to perform what you ought; perform withoutfail what you resolve.5.  FRUGALITY.  Make no expense but to do good to others or yourself;i.e., waste nothing.6.  INDUSTRY.  Lose no time; be always employ'd in something useful;cut off all unnecessary actions.7.  SINCERITY.  Use no hurtful deceit; think innocently and justly,and, if you speak, speak accordingly.8.  JUSTICE.  Wrong none by doing injuries, or omitting the benefitsthat are your duty.9.  MODERATION.  Avoid extreams; forbear resenting injuries so muchas you think they deserve.10.  CLEANLINESS.  Tolerate no uncleanliness in body, cloaths,or habitation.11.  TRANQUILLITY.  Be not disturbed at trifles, or at accidentscommon or unavoidable.12.  CHASTITY.  Rarely use venery but for health or offspring,never to dulness, weakness, or the injury of your own or another'speace or reputation.13.  HUMILITY.  Imitate Jesus and Socrates.My intention being to acquire the habitude of all these virtues,I judg'd it would be well not to distract my attention by attemptingthe whole at once, but to fix it on one of them at a time; and, when Ishould be master of that, then to proceed to another, and so on,till I should have gone thro' the thirteen; and, as the previousacquisition of some might facilitate the acquisition of certain others,I arrang'd them with that view, as they stand above.  Temperance first,as it tends to procure that coolness and clearness of head, which isso necessary where constant vigilance was to be kept up, and guardmaintained against the unremitting attraction of ancient habits,and the force of perpetual temptations.  This being acquir'dand establish'd, Silence would be more easy; and my desire beingto gain knowledge at the same time that I improv'd in virtue,and considering that in conversation it was obtain'd rather by the useof the ears than of the tongue, and therefore wishing to breaka habit I was getting into of prattling, punning, and joking,which only made me acceptable to trifling company, I gave Silencethe second place.  This and the next, Order, I expected wouldallow me more time for attending to my project and my studies.Resolution, once become habitual, would keep me firm in my endeavorsto obtain all the subsequent virtues; Frugality and Industry freeingme from my remaining debt, and producing affluence and independence,would make more easy the practice of Sincerity and Justice, etc., etc.Conceiving then, that, agreeably to the advice of Pythagorasin his Golden Verses, daily examination would be necessary,I contrived the following method for conducting that examination.I made a little book, in which I allotted a page for each of the virtues.I rul'd each page with red ink, so as to have seven columns,one for each day of the week, marking each column with a letterfor the day.  I cross'd these columns with thirteen red lines,marking the beginning of each line with the first letter of one ofthe virtues, on which line, and in its proper column, I might mark,by a little black spot, every fault I found upon examinationto have been committed respecting that virtue upon that day.Form of the pages.           +-------------------------------+           |              TEMPERANCE.      |           +-------------------------------+           |       EAT NOT TO DULNESS;     |           |     DRINK NOT TO ELEVATION.   |           +-------------------------------+           |   | S.| M.| T.| W.| T.| F.| S.|           +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+           | T.|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |           +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+           | S.| * | * |   | * |   | * |   |           +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+           | O.| **| * | * |   | * | * | * |           +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+           | R.|   |   | * |   |   | * |   |           +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+           | F.|   | * |   |   | * |   |   |           +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+           | I.|   |   | * |   |   |   |   |           +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+           | S.|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |           +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+           | J.|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |           +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+           | M.|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |           +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+           | C.|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |           +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+           | T.|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |           +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+           | C.|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |           +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+           | H.|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |           +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+I determined to give a week's strict attention to each ofthe virtues successively.  Thus, in the first week, my greatguard was to avoid every the least offence against Temperance,leaving the other virtues to their ordinary chance, only markingevery evening the faults of the day.  Thus, if in the first weekI could keep my first line, marked T, clear of spots, I suppos'dthe habit of that virtue so much strengthen'd and its oppositeweaken'd, that I might venture extending my attention to includethe next, and for the following week keep both lines clear of spots.Proceeding thus to the last, I could go thro' a course compleatin thirteen weeks, and four courses in a year.  And like him who,having a garden to weed, does not attempt to eradicate all the badherbs at once, which would exceed his reach and his strength, but workson one of the beds at a time, and, having accomplish'd the first,proceeds to a second, so I should have, I hoped, the encouragingpleasure of seeing on my pages the progress I made in virtue,by clearing successively my lines of their spots, till in the end,by a number of courses, I should he happy in viewing a clean book,after a thirteen weeks' daily examination.This my little book had for its motto these lines from Addison's Cato:          'Here will I hold.  If there's a power above us          (And that there is all nature cries aloud          Thro' all her works), He must delight in virtue;          And that which he delights in must be happy.'Another from Cicero,          'O vitae Philosophia dux! O virtutum indagatrix          expultrixque vitiorum! Unus dies, bene et ex praeceptis          tuis actus, peccanti immortalitati est anteponendus.'Another from the Proverbs of Solomon, speaking of wisdom or virtue:          'Length of days is in her right hand, and in her left hand          riches and honour.  Her ways are ways of pleasantness,          and all her paths are peace.' iii. 16, 17.And conceiving God to be the fountain of wisdom, I thought itright and necessary to solicit his assistance for obtaining it;to this end I formed the following little prayer, which was prefix'dto my tables of examination, for daily use.'O powerful Goodness! bountiful Father! merciful Guide!increase in me that wisdom which discovers my truest interest.strengthen my resolutions to perform what that wisdom dictates.Accept my kind offices to thy other children as the only returnin my power for thy continual favors to me.'I used also sometimes a little prayer which I took from Thomson's Poems,viz.:          'Father of light and life, thou Good Supreme!          O teach me what is good; teach me Thyself!          Save me from folly, vanity, and vice,          From every low pursuit; and fill my soul          With knowledge, conscious peace, and virtue pure;          Sacred, substantial, never-fading bliss!'The precept of Order requiring that every part of my business shouldhave its allotted time, one page in my little book contain'd thefollowing scheme of employment for the twenty-four hours of a natural day:     THE MORNING.            {  5 } Rise, wash, and address                             {    } Powerful Goodness!

After awhile I went thro' one course only in a year, and afterward onlyone in several years, till at length I omitted them entirely,being employ'd in voyages and business abroad, with a multiplicityof affairs that interfered; but I always carried my little bookwith me.My scheme of ORDER gave me the most trouble; and I found that, tho'it might be practicable where a man's business was such as to leavehim the disposition of his time, that of a journeyman printer,for instance, it was not possible to be exactly observed by a master,who must mix with the world, and often receive people of businessat their own hours.  Order, too, with regard to places for things,papers, etc., I found extreamly difficult to acquire.  I had notbeen early accustomed to it, and, having an exceeding good memory,I was not so sensible of the inconvenience attending want of method.This article, therefore, cost me so much painful attention, and my faultsin it vexed me so much, and I made so little progress in amendment,and had such frequent relapses, that I was almost ready to give upthe attempt, and content myself with a faulty character in that respect,like the man who, in buying an ax of a smith, my neighbour,desired to have the whole of its surface as bright as the edge.The smith consented to grind it bright for him if he would turnthe wheel; he turn'd, while the smith press'd the broad face ofthe ax hard and heavily on the stone, which made the turning of itvery fatiguing.  The man came every now and then from the wheel to seehow the work went on, and at length would take his ax as it was,without farther grinding.  'No,' said the smith, 'turn on, turn on;we shall have it bright by-and-by; as yet, it is only speckled.''Yes,' said the man, 'but I think I like a speckled ax best.'And I believe this may have been the case with many, who, having,for want of some such means as I employ'd, found the difficultyof obtaining good and breaking bad habits in other points of viceand virtue, have given up the struggle, and concluded that 'aspeckled ax was best'; for something, that pretended to be reason,was every now and then suggesting to me that such extream nicety as Iexacted of myself might be a kind of foppery in morals, which, if itwere known, would make me ridiculous; that a perfect charactermight be attended with the inconvenience of being envied and hated;and that a benevolent man should allow a few faults in himself,to keep his friends in countenance.In truth, I found myself incorrigible with respect to Order;and now I am grown old, and my memory bad, I feel very sensiblythe want of it.  But, on the whole, tho' I never arrived atthe perfection I had been so ambitious of obtaining, but fell farshort of it, yet I was, by the endeavour, a better and a happierman than I otherwise should have been if I had not attempted it;as those who aim at perfect writing by imitating the engraved copies,tho' they never reach the wish'd-for excellence of those copies,their hand is mended by the endeavor, and is tolerable while itcontinues fair and legible.It may be well my posterity should be informed that to thislittle artifice, with the blessing of God, their ancestor ow'd theconstant felicity of his life, down to his 79th year, in which thisis written.  What reverses may attend the remainder is in the handof Providence; but, if they arrive, the reflection on past happinessenjoy'd ought to help his bearing them with more resignation.To Temperance he ascribes his long-continued health, and what isstill left to him of a good constitution; to Industry and Frugality,the early easiness of his circumstances and acquisition of his fortune,with all that knowledge that enabled him to be a useful citizen,and obtained for him some degree of reputation among the learned;to Sincerity and Justice, the confidence of his country,and the honorable employs it conferred upon him; and to the jointinfluence of the whole mass of the virtues, even in the imperfectstate he was able to acquire them, all that evenness of temper,and that cheerfulness in conversation, which makes his companystill sought for, and agreeable even to his younger acquaintance.I hope, therefore, that some of my descendants may follow the exampleand reap the benefit.It will be remark'd that, tho' my scheme was not wholly without religion,there was in it no mark of any of the distinguishing tenets of anyparticular sect.  I had purposely avoided them; for, being fullypersuaded of the utility and excellency of my method, and that itmight be serviceable to people in all religions, and intendingsome time or other to publish it, I would not have any thingin it that should prejudice any one, of any sect, against it.I purposed writing a little comment on each virtue, in which Iwould have shown the advantages of possessing it, and the mischiefsattending its opposite vice; and I should have called my book THEART OF VIRTUE,<7> because it would have shown the means and mannerof obtaining virtue, which would have distinguished it from the mereexhortation to be good, that does not instruct and indicate the means,but is like the apostle's man of verbal charity, who only withoutshowing to the naked and hungry how or where they might get clothesor victuals, exhorted them to be fed and clothed.--James ii.  15, 16.     <7> Nothing so likely to make a man's fortune as virtue.         --[Marg. note.]But it so happened that my intention of writing and publishing thiscomment was never fulfilled.  I did, indeed, from time to time,put down short hints of the sentiments, reasonings, etc., to be madeuse of in it, some of which I have still by me; but the necessaryclose attention to private business in the earlier part of thy life,and public business since, have occasioned my postponing it; for,it being connected in my mind with a great and extensive project,that required the whole man to execute, and which an unforeseensuccession of employs prevented my attending to, it has hithertoremain'd unfinish'd.In this piece it was my design to explain and enforce this doctrine,that vicious actions are not hurtful because they are forbidden,but forbidden because they are hurtful, the nature of manalone considered; that it was, therefore, every one's interest to bevirtuous who wish'd to be happy even in this world; and I should,from this circumstance (there being always in the world a numberof rich merchants, nobility, states, and princes, who have needof honest instruments for the management of their affairs,and such being so rare), have endeavored to convince young personsthat no qualities were so likely to make a poor man's fortuneas those of probity and integrity.My list of virtues contain'd at first but twelve; but a Quakerfriend having kindly informed me that I was generally thought proud;that my pride show'd itself frequently in conversation; that Iwas not content with being in the right when discussing any point,but was overbearing, and rather insolent, of which he convinc'dme by mentioning several instances; I determined endeavouringto cure myself, if I could, of this vice or folly among the rest,and I added Humility to my list, giving an extensive meaning tothe word.I cannot boast of much success in acquiring the reality of this virtue,but I had a good deal with regard to the appearance of it.I made it a rule to forbear all direct contradiction to thesentiments of others, and all positive assertion of my own.I even forbid myself, agreeably to the old laws of our Junto,the use of every word or expression in the language that importeda fix'd opinion, such as certainly, undoubtedly, etc., and I adopted,instead of them, I conceive, I apprehend, or I imagine a thing to beso or so; or it so appears to me at present.  When another assertedsomething that I thought an error, I deny'd myself the pleasureof contradicting him abruptly, and of showing immediately someabsurdity in his proposition; and in answering I began by observingthat in certain cases or circumstances his opinion would be right,but in the present case there appear'd or seem'd to me some difference,etc.  I soon found the advantage of this change in my manner;the conversations I engag'd in went on more pleasantly.  The modestway in which I propos'd my opinions procur'd them a readier receptionand less contradiction; I had less mortification when I was foundto be in the wrong, and I more easily prevail'd with others to giveup their mistakes and join with me when I happened to be in the right.And this mode, which I at first put on with some violence tonatural inclination, became at length so easy, and so habitualto me, that perhaps for these fifty years past no one has everheard a dogmatical expression escape me.  And to this habit (aftermy character of integrity) I think it principally owing that Ihad early so much weight with my fellow-citizens when I proposednew institutions, or alterations in the old, and so much influencein public councils when I became a member; for I was but a bad speaker,never eloquent, subject to much hesitation in my choice of words,hardly correct in language, and yet I generally carried my points.In reality, there is, perhaps, no one of our natural passionsso hard to subdue as pride.  Disguise it, struggle with it,beat it down, stifle it, mortify it as much as one pleases, it isstill alive, and will every now and then peep out and show itself;you will see it, perhaps, often in this history; for, even if Icould conceive that I had compleatly overcome it, I should probablybe proud of my humility.[Thus far written at Passy, 1784.]['I am now about to write at home, August, 1788, but can not havethe help expected from my papers, many of them being lost in the war.I have, however, found the following.']<8>     <8>This is a marginal memorandum.--B.HAVING mentioned a great and extensive project which I hadconceiv'd, it seems proper that some account should be heregiven of that project and its object.  Its first rise in mymind appears in the following little paper, accidentally preserv'd, viz.:Observations on my reading history, in Library, May 19th, 1731.'That the great affairs of the world, the wars, revolutions,etc., are carried on and affected by parties.'That the view of these parties is their present general interest,or what they take to be such.'That the different views of these different parties occasionall confusion.'That while a party is carrying on a general design, each man hashis particular private interest in view.'That as soon as a party has gain'd its general point, each memberbecomes intent upon his particular interest; which, thwarting others,breaks that party into divisions, and occasions more confusion.'That few in public affairs act from a meer view of the good oftheir country, whatever they may pretend; and, tho' their actingsbring real good to their country, yet men primarily consideredthat their own and their country's interest was united, and didnot act from a principle of benevolence.'That fewer still, in public affairs, act with a view to the goodof mankind.'There seems to me at present to be great occasion for raisinga United Party for Virtue, by forming the virtuous and good menof all nations into a regular body, to be govern'd by suitablegood and wise rules, which good and wise men may probably be moreunanimous in their obedience to, than common people are to common laws.'I at present think that whoever attempts this aright, and iswell qualified, can not fail of pleasing God, and of meetingwith success.  B. F.'Revolving this project in my mind, as to be undertaken hereafter,when my circumstances should afford me the necessary leisure,I put down from time to time, on pieces of paper, such thoughtsas occurr'd to me respecting it.  Most of these are lost; but I findone purporting to be the substance of an intended creed, containing,as I thought, the essentials of every known religion, and being freeof every thing that might shock the professors of any religion.It is express'd in these words, viz.:'That there is one God, who made all things.'That he governs the world by his providence.'That he ought to be worshiped by adoration, prayer, and thanksgiving.'But that the most acceptable service of God is doing good to man.'That the soul is immortal.'And that God will certainly reward virtue and punish vice eitherhere or hereafter.'<9>     <9> In the Middle Ages, 
ESFJ	, if such a phenomenon as         
ESFJ	 were possible in the Middle Ages, would         probably have been the founder of a monastic order.--B.My ideas at that time were, that the sect should be begun andspread at first among young and single men only; that each personto be initiated should not only declare his assent to such creed,but should have exercised himself with the thirteen weeks'examination and practice of the virtues, as in the before-mention'd model;that the existence of such a society should he kept a secret,till it was become considerable, to prevent solicitationsfor the admission of improper persons, but that the membersshould each of them search among his acquaintance for ingenuous,well-disposed youths, to whom, with prudent caution, the schemeshould be gradually communicated; that the members should engageto afford their advice, assistance, and support to each otherin promoting one another's interests, business, and advancementin life; that, for distinction, we should be call'd The Society ofthe Free and Easy:  free, as being, by the general practice and habitof the virtues, free from the dominion of vice; and particularlyby the practice of industry and frugality, free from debt, whichexposes a man to confinement, and a species of slavery to his creditors.This is as much as I can now recollect of the project,except that I communicated it in part to two young men, who adoptedit with some enthusiasm; but my then narrow circumstances,and the necessity I was under of sticking close to my business,occasion'd my postponing the further prosecution of it at that time;and my multifarious occupations, public and private, induc'd meto continue postponing, so that it has been omitted till I have nolonger strength or activity left sufficient for such an enterprise;tho' I am still of opinion that it was a practicable scheme,and might have been very useful, by forming a great number ofgood citizens; and I was not discourag'd by the seeming magnitudeof the undertaking, as I have always thought that one man of tolerableabilities may work great changes, and accomplish great affairsamong mankind, if he first forms a good plan, and, cutting off allamusements or other employments that would divert his attention,makes the execution of that same plan his sole study and business.In 1732 I first publish'd my Almanack, under the name of Richard Saunders;it was continu'd by me about twenty-five years, commonly call'dPoor Richard's Almanac.  I endeavor'd to make it both entertainingand useful, and it accordingly came to be in such demand, that I reap'dconsiderable profit from it, vending annually near ten thousand.And observing that it was generally read, scarce any neighborhoodin the province being without it, I consider'd it as a proper vehiclefor conveying instruction among the common people, who bought scarcelyany other books; I therefore filled all the little spaces that occurr'dbetween the remarkable days in the calendar with proverbial sentences,chiefly such as inculcated industry and frugality, as the meansof procuring wealth, and thereby securing virtue; it being moredifficult for a man in want, to act always honestly, as, to usehere one of those proverbs, it is hard for an empty sack to stand up-right.These proverbs, which contained the wisdom of many ages and nations,I assembled and form'd into a connected discourse prefix'd to theAlmanack of 1757, as the harangue of a wise old man to the peopleattending an auction.  The bringing all these scatter'd counselsthus into a focus enabled them to make greater impression.The piece, being universally approved, was copied in all thenewspapers of the Continent; reprinted in Britain on a broad side,to be stuck up in houses; two translations were made of it in French,and great numbers bought by the clergy and gentry, to distributegratis among their poor parishioners and tenants.  In Pennsylvania,as it discouraged useless expense in foreign superfluities, some thoughtit had its share of influence in producing that growing plentyof money which was observable for several years after its publication.I considered my newspaper, also, as another means of communicatinginstruction, and in that view frequently reprinted in it extractsfrom the Spectator, and other moral writers; and sometimes publish'dlittle pieces of my own, which had been first compos'd for readingin our Junto.  Of these are a Socratic dialogue, tending to prove that,whatever might be his parts and abilities, a vicious man could notproperly be called a man of sense; and a discourse on self-denial,showing that virtue was not secure till its practice became a habitude,and was free from the opposition of contrary inclinations.These may be found in the papers about the beginning Of 1735.In the conduct of my newspaper, I carefully excluded all libellingand personal abuse, which is of late years become so disgracefulto our country.  Whenever I was solicited to insert anythingof that kind, and the writers pleaded, as they generally did,the liberty of the press, and that a newspaper was like a stagecoach,in which any one who would pay had a right to a place, my answer was,that I would print the piece separately if desired, and the authormight have as many copies as he pleased to distribute himself,but that I would not take upon me to spread his detraction;and that, having contracted with my subscribers to furnish themwith what might be either useful or entertaining, I could not filltheir papers with private altercation, in which they had no concern,without doing them manifest injustice.  Now, many of our printers makeno scruple of gratifying the malice of individuals by false accusationsof the fairest characters among ourselves, augmenting animosityeven to the producing of duels; and are, moreover, so indiscreetas to print scurrilous reflections on the government of neighboringstates, and even on the conduct of our best national allies,which may be attended with the most pernicious consequences.These things I mention as a caution to young printers, and thatthey may be encouraged not to pollute their presses and disgracetheir profession by such infamous practices, but refuse steadily,as they may see by my example that such a course of conduct will not,on the whole, be injurious to their interests.In 1733 I sent one of my journeymen to Charleston, South Carolina,where a printer was wanting.  I furnish'd him with a press and letters,on an agreement of partnership, by which I was to receive one-thirdof the profits of the business, paying one-third of the expense.He was a man of learning, and honest but ignorant in mattersof account; and, tho' he sometimes made me remittances, I could getno account from him, nor any satisfactory state of our partnershipwhile he lived.  On his decease, the business was continued byhis widow, who, being born and bred in Holland, where, as I have beeninform'd, the knowledge of accounts makes a part of female education,she not only sent me as clear a state as she could find of thetransactions past, but continued to account with the greatestregularity and exactness every quarter afterwards, and managedthe business with such success, that she not only brought up reputablya family of children, but, at the expiration of the term, was ableto purchase of me the printing-house, and establish her son in it.I mention this affair chiefly for the sake of recommending that branchof education for our young females, as likely to be of more useto them and their children, in case of widowhood, than either musicor dancing, by preserving them from losses by imposition of crafty men,and enabling them to continue, perhaps, a profitable mercantile house,with establish'd correspondence, till a son is grown up fit to undertakeand go on with it, to the lasting advantage and enriching of the family.About the year 1734 there arrived among us from Ireland a youngPresbyterian preacher, named Hemphill, who delivered with agood voice, and apparently extempore, most excellent discourses,which drew together considerable numbers of different persuasion,who join'd in admiring them.  Among the rest, I became one of hisconstant hearers, his sermons pleasing me, as they had littleof the dogmatical kind, but inculcated strongly the practiceof virtue, or what in the religious stile are called good works.Those, however, of our congregation, who considered themselvesas orthodox Presbyterians, disapprov'd his doctrine, and were join'dby most of the old clergy, who arraign'd him of heterodoxy beforethe synod, in order to have him silenc'd. I became his zealous partisan,and contributed all I could to raise a party in his favour, and wecombated for him a while with some hopes of success.  There was muchscribbling pro and con upon the occasion; and finding that, tho'an elegant preacher, he was but a poor writer, I lent him my penand wrote for him two or three pamphlets, and one piece in the Gazetteof April, 1735.  Those pamphlets, as is generally the case withcontroversial writings, tho' eagerly read at the time, were soonout of vogue, and I question whether a single copy of them now exists.During the contest an unlucky occurrence hurt his cause exceedingly.One of our adversaries having heard him preach a sermon that wasmuch admired, thought he had somewhere read the sermon before,or at least a part of it.  On search he found that part quotedat length, in one of the British Reviews, from a discourseof Dr. Foster's. This detection gave many of our party disgust,who accordingly abandoned his cause, and occasion'd our more speedydiscomfiture in the synod.  I stuck by him, however, as I ratherapprov'd his giving us good sermons compos'd by others, than badones of his own manufacture, tho' the latter was the practiceof our common teachers.  He afterward acknowledg'd to me that noneof those he preach'd were his own; adding, that his memory was suchas enabled him to retain and repeat any sermon after one reading only.On our defeat, he left us in search elsewhere of better fortune,and I quitted the congregation, never joining it after, tho' I continu'dmany years my subscription for the support of its ministers.I had begun in 1733 to study languages; I soon made myself so mucha master of the French as to be able to read the books with ease.I then undertook the Italian.  An acquaintance, who was alsolearning it, us'd often to tempt me to play chess with him.Finding this took up too much of the time I had to spare for study,I at length refus'd to play any more, unless on this condition,that the victor in every game should have a right to impose a task,either in parts of the grammar to be got by heart, or in translations,etc., which tasks the vanquish'd was to perform upon honour,before our next meeting.  As we play'd pretty equally, we thus beatone another into that language.  I afterwards with a little painstaking,acquir'd as much of the Spanish as to read their books also.I have already mention'd that I had only one year's instructionin a Latin school, and that when very young, after which I neglectedthat language entirely.  But, when I had attained an acquaintancewith the French, Italian, and Spanish, I was surpriz'd to find,on looking over a Latin Testament, that I understood so much moreof that language than I had imagined, which encouraged me to applymyself again to the study of it, and I met with more success,as those preceding languages had greatly smooth'd my way.From these circumstances, I have thought that there is some inconsistencyin our common mode of teaching languages.  We are told that it isproper to begin first with the Latin, and, having acquir'd that,it will be more easy to attain those modern languages which arederiv'd from it; and yet we do not begin with the Greek, in ordermore easily to acquire the Latin.  It is true that, if you canclamber and get to the top of a staircase without using the steps,you will more easily gain them in descending; but certainly, if youbegin with the lowest you will with more ease ascend to the top;and I would therefore offer it to the consideration of those whosuperintend the education of our youth, whether, since many ofthose who begin with the Latin quit the same after spending someyears without having made any great proficiency, and what they havelearnt becomes almost useless, so that their time has been lost,it would not have been better to have begun with the French,proceeding to the Italian, etc.; for, tho', after spending the same time,they should quit the study of languages and never arrive atthe Latin, they would, however, have acquired another tongue or two,that, being in modern use, might be serviceable to them in common life.After ten years' absence from Boston, and having become easy inmy circumstances, I made a journey thither to visit my relations,which I could not sooner well afford.  In returning, I call'd at Newportto see my brother, then settled there with his printing-house. Ourformer differences were forgotten, and our meeting was very cordialand affectionate.  He was fast declining in his health, and requestedof me that, in case of his death, which he apprehended not far distant,I would take home his son, then but ten years of age, and bring himup to the printing business.  This I accordingly perform'd, sendinghim a few years to school before I took him into the office.His mother carried on the business till he was grown up, when Iassisted him with an assortment of new types, those of his fatherbeing in a manner worn out.  Thus it was that I made my brother ampleamends for the service I had depriv'd him of by leaving him so early.In 1736 I lost one of my sons, a fine boy of four years old,by the small-pox, taken in the common way.  I long regretted bitterly,and still regret that I had not given it to him by inoculation.This I mention for the sake of parents who omit that operation,on the supposition that they should never forgive themselvesif a child died under it; my example showing that the regretmay be the same either way, and that, therefore, the safer shouldbe chosen.Our club, the Junto, was found so useful, and afforded such satisfactionto the members, that several were desirous of introducing their friends,which could not well be done without exceeding what we had settledas a convenient number, viz., twelve.  We had from the beginningmade it a rule to keep our institution a secret, which was prettywell observ'd; the intention was to avoid applications of improperpersons for admittance, some of whom, perhaps, we might findit difficult to refuse.  I was one of those who were againstany addition to our number, but, instead of it, made in writinga proposal, that every member separately should endeavor to forma subordinate club, with the same rules respecting queries,etc., and without informing them of the connection with the Junto.The advantages proposed were, the improvement of so many more youngcitizens by the use of our institutions; our better acquaintancewith the general sentiments of the inhabitants on any occasion,as the Junto member might propose what queries we should desire,and was to report to the Junto what pass'd in his separate club;the promotion of our particular interests in business by moreextensive recommendation, and the increase of our influencein public affairs, and our power of doing good by spreading thro'the several clubs the sentiments of the Junto.The project was approv'd, and every member undertook to form his club,but they did not all succeed.  Five or six only were compleated,which were called by different names, as the Vine, the Union,the Band, etc.  They were useful to themselves, and afforded us a gooddeal of amusement, information, and instruction, besides answering,in some considerable degree, our views of influencing the publicopinion on particular occasions, of which I shall give some instancesin course of time as they happened.My first promotion was my being chosen, in 1736, clerk of theGeneral Assembly.  The choice was made that year without opposition;but the year following, when I was again propos'd (the choice,like that of the members, being annual), a new member made a longspeech against me, in order to favour some other candidate.I was, however, chosen, which was the more agreeable to me, as,besides the pay for the immediate service as clerk, the place gaveme a better opportunity of keeping up an interest among the members,which secur'd to me the business of printing the votes, laws, paper money,and other occasional jobbs for the public, that, on the whole,were very profitable.I therefore did not like the opposition of this new member, who wasa gentleman of fortune and education, with talents that were likelyto give him, in time, great influence in the House, which, indeed,afterwards happened.  I did not, however, aim at gaining hisfavour by paying any servile respect to him, but, after some time,took this other method.  Having heard that he had in his librarya certain very scarce and curious book, I wrote a note to him,expressing my desire of perusing that book, and requesting hewould do me the favour of lending it to me for a few days.He sent it immediately, and I return'd it in about a weekwith another note, expressing strongly my sense of the favour.When we next met in the House, he spoke to me (which he hadnever done before), and with great civility; and he ever aftermanifested a readiness to serve me on all occasions, so that webecame great friends, and our friendship continued to his death.This is another instance of the truth of an old maxim I had learned,which says, 'He that has once done you a kindness will be moreready to do you another, than he whom you yourself have obliged.'And it shows how much more profitable it is prudently to remove,than to resent, return, and continue inimical proceedings.In 1737, Colonel Spotswood, late governor of Virginia, and thenpostmaster-general, being dissatisfied with the conduct of hisdeputy at Philadelphia, respecting some negligence in rendering,and inexactitude of his accounts, took from him the commission and offeredit to me.  I accepted it readily, and found it of great advantage;for, tho' the salary was small, it facilitated the correspondencethat improv'd my newspaper, increas'd the number demanded, as wellas the advertisements to be inserted, so that it came to affordme a considerable income.  My old competitor's newspaper declin'dproportionably, and I was satisfy'd without retaliating his refusal,while postmaster, to permit my papers being carried by the riders.Thus he suffer'd greatly from his neglect in due accounting; and Imention it as a lesson to those young men who may be employ'd inmanaging affairs for others, that they should always render accounts,and make remittances, with great clearness and punctuality.The character of observing such a conduct is the most powerfulof all recommendations to new employments and increase of business.I began now to turn my thoughts a little to public affairs,beginning, however, with small matters.  The city watch wasone of the first things that I conceiv'd to want regulation.It was managed by the constables of the respective wards in turn;the constable warned a number of housekeepers to attend him forthe night.  Those who chose never to attend paid him six shillingsa year to be excus'd, which was suppos'd to be for hiring substitutes,but was, in reality, much more than was necessary for that purpose,and made the constableship a place of profit; and the constable,for a little drink, often got such ragamuffins about him as a watch,that respectable housekeepers did not choose to mix with.Walking the rounds, too, was often neglected, and most of the nightsspent in tippling.  I thereupon wrote a paper, to be read in Junto,representing these irregularities, but insisting more particularlyon the inequality of this six-shilling tax of the constables,respecting the circumstances of those who paid it, since a poorwidow housekeeper, all whose property to be guarded by the watchdid not perhaps exceed the value of fifty pounds, paid as much asthe wealthiest merchant, who had thousands of pounds worth of goodsin his stores.On the whole, I proposed as a more effectual watch, the hiringof proper men to serve constantly in that business; and as a moreequitable way of supporting the charge the levying a tax thatshould be proportion'd to the property.  This idea, being approv'dby the Junto, was communicated to the other clubs, but as arisingin each of them; and though the plan was not immediately carriedinto execution, yet, by preparing the minds of people for the change,it paved the way for the law obtained a few years after,when the members of our clubs were grown into more influence.About this time I wrote a paper (first to be read in Junto, but itwas afterward publish'd) on the different accidents and carelessnessesby which houses were set on fire, with cautions against them,and means proposed of avoiding them.  This was much spoken of as auseful piece, and gave rise to a project, which soon followed it,of forming a company for the more ready extinguishing of fires,and mutual assistance in removing and securing the goods when in danger.Associates in this scheme were presently found, amounting to thirty.Our articles of agreement oblig'd every member to keep always ingood order, and fit for use, a certain number of leather buckets,with strong bags and baskets (for packing and transporting of goods),which were to be brought to every fire; and we agreed to meet oncea month and spend a social evening together, in discoursing andcommunicating such ideas as occurred to us upon the subject of fires,as might be useful in our conduct on such occasions.The utility of this institution soon appeared, and many more desiringto be admitted than we thought convenient for one company, they wereadvised to form another, which was accordingly done; and this went on,one new company being formed after another, till they became so numerousas to include most of the inhabitants who were men of property;and now, at the time of my writing this, tho' upward of fifty yearssince its establishment, that which I first formed, called the UnionFire Company, still subsists and flourishes, tho' the first membersare all deceas'd but myself and one, who is older by a year than I am.The small fines that have been paid by members for absence at the monthlymeetings have been apply'd to the purchase of fire-engines, ladders,fire-hooks, and other useful implements for each company, so that Iquestion whether there is a city in the world better provided withthe means of putting a stop to beginning conflagrations; and, in fact,since these institutions, the city has never lost by fire morethan one or two houses at a time, and the flames have often beenextinguished before the house in which they began has been half consumed.In 1739 arrived among us from Ireland the Reverend Mr. Whitefield,who had made himself remarkable there as an itinerant preacher.He was at first permitted to preach in some of our churches;but the clergy, taking a dislike to him, soon refus'd him their pulpits,and he was oblig'd to preach in the fields.  The multitudes of allsects and denominations that attended his sermons were enormous,and it was matter of speculation to me, who was one of the number,to observe the extraordinary influence of his oratory on his hearers,and how much they admir'd and respected him, notwithstanding hiscommon abuse of them, by assuring them that they were naturally halfbeasts and half devils.  It was wonderful to see the change soonmade in the manners of our inhabitants.  From being thoughtlessor indifferent about religion, it seem'd as if all the worldwere growing religious, so that one could not walk thro' the townin an evening without hearing psalms sung in different families ofevery street.And it being found inconvenient to assemble in the open air,subject to its inclemencies, the building of a house to meet in wasno sooner propos'd, and persons appointed to receive contributions,but sufficient sums were soon receiv'd to procure the ground and erectthe building, which was one hundred feet long and seventy broad,about the size of Westminster Hall; and the work was carried onwith such spirit as to be finished in a much shorter time than couldhave been expected.  Both house and ground were vested in trustees,expressly for the use of any preacher of any religious persuasionwho might desire to say something to the people at Philadelphia;the design in building not being to accommodate any particular sect,but the inhabitants in general; so that even if the Mufti ofConstantinople were to send a missionary to preach Mohammedanism to us,he would find a pulpit at his service.Mr. Whitefield, in leaving us, went preaching all the way thro'the colonies to Georgia.  The settlement of that provincehad lately been begun, but, instead of being made with hardy,industrious husbandmen, accustomed to labor, the only people fitfor such an enterprise, it was with families of broken shop-keepersand other insolvent debtors, many of indolent and idle habits,taken out of the jails, who, being set down in the woods, unqualified forclearing land, and unable to endure the hardships of a new settlement,perished in numbers, leaving many helpless children unprovided for.The sight of their miserable situation inspir'd the benevolent heartof Mr. Whitefield with the idea of building an Orphan House there,in which they might be supported and educated.  Returning northward,he preach'd up this charity, and made large collections,for his eloquence had a wonderful power over the hearts and pursesof his hearers, of which I myself was an instance.I did not disapprove of the design, but, as Georgia was thendestitute of materials and workmen, and it was proposed to sendthem from Philadelphia at a great expense, I thought it would havebeen better to have built the house here, and brought the childrento it.  This I advis'd; but he was resolute in his first project,rejected my counsel, and I therefore refus'd to contribute.I happened soon after to attend one of his sermons, in the courseof which I perceived he intended to finish with a collection,and I silently resolved he should get nothing from me, I had in mypocket a handful of copper money, three or four silver dollars,and five pistoles in gold.  As he proceeded I began to soften,and concluded to give the coppers.  Another stroke of his oratorymade me asham'd of that, and determin'd me to give the silver;and he finish'd so admirably, that I empty'd my pocket wholly intothe collector's dish, gold and all.  At this sermon there was alsoone of our club, who, being of my sentiments respecting the buildingin Georgia, and suspecting a collection might be intended, had,by precaution, emptied his pockets before he came from home.Towards the conclusion of the discourse, however, he felt a strongdesire to give, and apply'd to a neighbour, who stood near him,to borrow some money for the purpose.  The application wasunfortunately [made] to perhaps the only man in the company who hadthe firmness not to be affected by the preacher.  His answer was,'At any other time, Friend Hopkinson, I would lend to thee freely;but not now, for thee seems to be out of thy right senses.'Some of Mr. Whitefield's enemies affected to suppose that he wouldapply these collections to his own private emolument; but I who wasintimately acquainted with him (being employed in printing his Sermonsand Journals, etc.), never had the least suspicion of his integrity,but am to this day decidedly of opinion that he was in all his conducta perfectly honest man, and methinks my testimony in his favourought to have the more weight, as we had no religious connection.He us'd, indeed, sometimes to pray for my conversion, but neverhad the satisfaction of believing that his prayers were heard.Ours was a mere civil friendship, sincere on both sides, and lastedto his death.The following instance will show something of the terms on whichwe stood.  Upon one of his arrivals from England at Boston,he wrote to me that he should come soon to Philadelphia,but knew not where he could lodge when there, as he understoodhis old friend and host, Mr. Benezet, was removed to Germantown.My answer was, 'You know my house; if you can make shift withits scanty accommodations, you will be most heartily welcome.'He reply'd, that if I made that kind offer for Christ's sake,I should not miss of a reward.  And I returned, 'Don't let mebe mistaken; it was not for Christ's sake, but for your sake.'One of our common acquaintance jocosely remark'd, that, knowing itto be the custom of the saints, when they received any favour,to shift the burden of the obligation from off their own shoulders,and place it in heaven, I had contriv'd to fix it on earth.The last time I saw Mr. Whitefield was in London, when he consultedme about his Orphan House concern, and his purpose of appropriatingit to the establishment of a college.He had a loud and clear voice, and articulated his words andsentences so perfectly, that he might be heard and understood ata great distance, especially as his auditories, however numerous,observ'd the most exact silence.  He preach'd one evening from the topof the Court-house steps, which are in the middle of Market-street,and on the west side of Second-street, which crosses it at right angles.Both streets were fill'd with his hearers to a considerable distance.Being among the hindmost in Market-street, I had the curiosityto learn how far he could be heard, by retiring backwards downthe street towards the river; and I found his voice distinct till Icame near Front-street, when some noise in that street obscur'd it.Imagining then a semi-circle, of which my distance should be the radius,and that it were fill'd with auditors, to each of whom I allow'dtwo square feet, I computed that he might well be heard by morethan thirty thousand.  This reconcil'd me to the newspaper accountsof his having preach'd to twenty-five thousand people in the fields,and to the antient histories of generals haranguing whole armies,of which I had sometimes doubted.By hearing him often, I came to distinguish easily between sermonsnewly compos'd, and those which he had often preach'd in the courseof his travels.  His delivery of the latter was so improv'd by frequentrepetitions that every accent, every emphasis, every modulationof voice, was so perfectly well turn'd and well plac'd, that,without being interested in the subject, one could not help beingpleas'd with the discourse; a pleasure of much the same kind with thatreceiv'd from an excellent piece of musick.  This is an advantageitinerant preachers have over those who are stationary, as the lattercan not well improve their delivery of a sermon by so many rehearsals.His writing and printing from time to time gave great advantageto his enemies; unguarded expressions, and even erroneous opinions,delivered in preaching, might have been afterwards explain'dor qualifi'd by supposing others that might have accompani'd them,or they might have been deny'd; but litera scripta monet.Critics attack'd his writings violently, and with so much appearanceof reason as to diminish the number of his votaries and preventtheir encrease; so that I am of opinion if he had never writtenany thing, he would have left behind him a much more numerousand important sect, and his reputation might in that case have beenstill growing, even after his death, as there being nothing of hiswriting on which to found a censure and give him a lower character,his proselytes would be left at liberty to feign for him as greata variety of excellence as their enthusiastic admiration might wishhim to have possessed.My business was now continually augmenting, and my circumstances growingdaily easier, my newspaper having become very profitable, as beingfor a time almost the only one in this and the neighbouring provinces.I experienced, too, the truth of the observation, 'that aftergetting the first hundred pound, it is more easy to get the second,'money itself being of a prolific nature.The partnership at Carolina having succeeded, I was encourag'dto engage in others, and to promote several of my workmen,who had behaved well, by establishing them with printing-housesin different colonies, on the same terms with that in Carolina.Most of them did well, being enabled at the end of our term, six years,to purchase the types of me and go on working for themselves,by which means several families were raised.  Partnerships oftenfinish in quarrels; but I was happy in this, that mine were allcarried on and ended amicably, owing, I think, a good deal tothe precaution of having very explicitly settled, in our articles,every thing to be done by or expected from each partner, so thatthere was nothing to dispute, which precaution I would thereforerecommend to all who enter into partnerships; for, whatever esteempartners may have for, and confidence in each other at the timeof the contract, little jealousies and disgusts may arise, with ideasof inequality in the care and burden of the business, etc., whichare attended often with breach of friendship and of the connection,perhaps with lawsuits and other disagreeable consequences.I had, on the whole, abundant reason to be satisfied with my beingestablished in Pennsylvania.  There were, however, two thingsthat I regretted, there being no provision for defense, nor fora compleat education of youth; no militia, nor any college.I therefore, in 1743, drew up a proposal for establishing an academy;and at that time, thinking the Reverend Mr. Peters, who was outof employ, a fit person to superintend such an institution,I communicated the project to him; but he, having more profitableviews in the service of the proprietaries, which succeeded,declin'd the undertaking; and, not knowing another at that timesuitable for such a trust, I let the scheme lie a while dormant.I succeeded better the next year, 1744, in proposing and establishinga Philosophical Society.  The paper I wrote for that purpose willbe found among my writings, when collected.With respect to defense, Spain having been several years at waragainst Great Britain, and being at length join'd by France,which brought us into great danger; and the laboured and long-continuedendeavour of our governor, Thomas, to prevail with our Quaker Assemblyto pass a militia law, and make other provisions for the securityof the province, having proved abortive, I determined to try what mightbe done by a voluntary association of the people.  To promote this,I first wrote and published a pamphlet, entitled PLAIN TRUTH, in which Istated our defenceless situation in strong lights, with the necessityof union and discipline for our defense, and promis'd to propose ina few days an association, to be generally signed for that purpose.The pamphlet had a sudden and surprising effect.  I was call'd uponfor the instrument of association, and having settled the draftof it with a few friends, I appointed a meeting of the citizensin the large building before mentioned.  The house was pretty full;I had prepared a number of printed copies, and provided pens and inkdispers'd all over the room.  I harangued them a little on the subject,read the paper, and explained it, and then distributed the copies,which were eagerly signed, not the least objection being made.When the company separated, and the papers were collected, we foundabove twelve hundred hands; and, other copies being dispersedin the country, the subscribers amounted at length to upwardof ten thousand.  These all furnished themselves as soon as theycould with arms, formed themselves into companies and regiments,chose their own officers, and met every week to be instructedin the manual exercise, and other parts of military discipline.The women, by subscriptions among themselves, provided silk colors,which they presented to the companies, painted with different devicesand mottos, which I supplied.The officers of the companies composing the Philadelphia regiment,being met, chose me for their colonel; but, conceiving myself unfit,I declin'd that station, and recommended Mr. Lawrence, a fineperson, and man of influence, who was accordingly appointed.I then propos'd a lottery to defray the expense of buildinga battery below the town, and furnishing it with cannon.It filled expeditiously, and the battery was soon erected, the merlonsbeing fram'd of logs and fill'd with earth.  We bought some oldcannon from Boston, but, these not being sufficient, we wrote toEngland for more, soliciting, at the same time, our proprietariesfor some assistance, tho' without much expectation of obtaining it.Meanwhile, Colonel Lawrence, William Allen, Abram Taylor,Esqr., and myself were sent to New York by the associators,commission'd to borrow some cannon of Governor Clinton.  He at firstrefus'd us peremptorily; but at dinner with his council, where therewas great drinking of Madeira wine, as the custom of that placethen was, he softened by degrees, and said he would lend us six.After a few more bumpers he advanc'd to ten; and at length hevery good-naturedly conceded eighteen.  They were fine cannon,eighteen-pounders, with their carriages, which we soon transportedand mounted on our battery, where the associators kept a nightlyguard while the war lasted, and among the rest I regularly tookmy turn of duty there as a common soldier.My activity in these operations was agreeable to the governor and council;they took me into confidence, and I was consulted by them in everymeasure wherein their concurrence was thought useful to the association.Calling in the aid of religion, I propos'd to them the proclaiminga fast, to promote reformation, and implore the blessing of Heaven onour undertaking.  They embrac'd the motion; but, as it was the firstfast ever thought of in the province, the secretary had no precedentfrom which to draw the proclamation.  My education in New England,where a fast is proclaimed every year, was here of some advantage:I drew it in the accustomed stile, it was translated into German,printed in both languages, and divulg'd thro' the province.  This gavethe clergy of the different sects an opportunity of influencing theircongregations to join in the association, and it would probably havebeen general among all but Quakers if the peace had not soon interven'd.It was thought by some of my friends that, by my activity inthese affairs, I should offend that sect, and thereby lose my interestin the Assembly of the province, where they formed a great majority.A young gentleman who had likewise some friends in the House,and wished to succeed me as their clerk, acquainted me that itwas decided to displace me at the next election; and he, therefore,in good will, advis'd me to resign, as more consistent with my honourthan being turn'd out.  My answer to him was, that I had read or heardof some public man who made it a rule never to ask for an office,and never to refuse one when offer'd to him.  'I approve,'says I, 'of his rule, and will practice it with a small addition;I shall never ask, never refuse, nor ever resign an office.If they will have my office of clerk to dispose of to another,they shall take it from me.  I will not, by giving it up, lose myright of some time or other making reprisals on my adversaries.'I heard, however, no more of this; I was chosen again unanimouslyas usual at the next election.  Possibly, as they dislik'd my lateintimacy with the members of council, who had join'd the governorsin all the disputes about military preparations, with which the Househad long been harass'd, they might have been pleas'd if I wouldvoluntarily have left them; but they did not care to displace meon account merely of my zeal for the association, and they couldnot well give another reason.Indeed I had some cause to believe that the defense of the countrywas not disagreeable to any of them, provided they were not requir'dto assist in it.  And I found that a much greater number of themthan I could have imagined, tho' against offensive war, were clearlyfor the defensive.  Many pamphlets pro and con were publish'don the subject, and some by good Quakers, in favour of defense,which I believe convinc'd most of their younger people.A transaction in our fire company gave me some insight into theirprevailing sentiments.  It had been propos'd that we should encouragethe scheme for building a battery by laying out the present stock,then about sixty pounds, in tickets of the lottery.  By our rules,no money could be dispos'd of till the next meeting after the proposal.The company consisted of thirty members, of which twenty-twowere Quakers, and eight only of other persuasions.  We eightpunctually attended the meeting; but, tho' we thought that some ofthe Quakers would join us, we were by no means sure of a majority.Only one Quaker, Mr. James Morris, appear'd to oppose the measure.He expressed much sorrow that it had ever been propos'd, as he saidFriends were all against it, and it would create such discord as mightbreak up the company.  We told him that we saw no reason for that;we were the minority, and if Friends were against the measure,and outvoted us, we must and should, agreeably to the usageof all societies, submit.  When the hour for business arriv'dit was mov'd to put the vote; he allow'd we might then do itby the rules, but, as he could assure us that a number of membersintended to be present for the purpose of opposing it, it wouldbe but candid to allow a little time for their appearing.While we were disputing this, a waiter came to tell me two gentlemenbelow desir'd to speak with me.  I went down, and found they were twoof our Quaker members.  They told me there were eight of them assembledat a tavern just by; that they were determin'd to come and vote with usif there should be occasion, which they hop'd would not be the case,and desir'd we would not call for their assistance if we could dowithout it, as their voting for such a measure might embroil themwith their elders and friends.  Being thus secure of a majority,I went up, and after a little seeming hesitation, agreed to a delayof another hour.  This Mr. Morris allow'd to be extreamly fair.Not one of his opposing friends appear'd, at which he express'dgreat surprize; and, at the expiration of the hour, we carry'dthe resolution eight to one; and as, of the twenty-two Quakers,eight were ready to vote with us, and thirteen, by their absence,manifested that they were not inclin'd to oppose the measure,I afterward estimated the proportion of Quakers sincerely againstdefense as one to twenty-one only; for these were all regular membersof that society, and in good reputation among them, and had duenotice of what was propos'd at that meeting.The honorable and learned Mr. Logan, who had always been of that sect,was one who wrote an address to them, declaring his approbation ofdefensive war, and supporting his opinion by many strong arguments.He put into my hands sixty pounds to be laid out in lottery ticketsfor the battery, with directions to apply what prizes might be drawnwholly to that service.  He told me the following anecdote of hisold master, William Penn, respecting defense.  He came over from England,when a young man, with that proprietary, and as his secretary.It was war-time, and their ship was chas'd by an armed vessel,suppos'd to be an enemy.  Their captain prepar'd for defense;but told William Penn and his company of Quakers, that he didnot expect their assistance, and they might retire into the cabin,which they did, except James Logan, who chose to stay upon deck,and was quarter'd to a gun.  The suppos'd enemy prov'd a friend,so there was no fighting; but when the secretary went down tocommunicate the intelligence, William Penn rebuk'd him severely forstaying upon deck, and undertaking to assist in defending the vessel,contrary to the principles of Friends, especially as it had not beenrequired by the captain.  This reproof, being before all the company,piqu'd the secretary, who answer'd, 'I being thy servant, why didthee not order me to come down?  But thee was willing enough that Ishould stay and help to fight the ship when thee thought therewas danger.'My being many years in the Assembly, the majority of which wereconstantly Quakers, gave me frequent opportunities of seeingthe embarrassment given them by their principle against war,whenever application was made to them, by order of the crown,to grant aids for military purposes.  They were unwilling to offendgovernment, on the one hand, by a direct refusal; and their friends,the body of the Quakers, on the other, by a compliance contraryto their principles; hence a variety of evasions to avoid complying,and modes of disguising the compliance when it became unavoidable.The common mode at last was, to grant money under the phrase of itsbeing 'for the king's use,' and never to inquire how it was applied.But, if the demand was not directly from the crown, that phrase wasfound not so proper, and some other was to be invented.  As, when powderwas wanting (I think it was for the garrison at Louisburg), and thegovernment of New England solicited a grant of some from Pennsilvania,which was much urg'd on the House by Governor Thomas, they couldnot grant money to buy powder, because that was an ingredient of war;but they voted an aid to New England of three thousand pounds,to he put into the hands of the governor, and appropriated itfor the purchasing of bread, flour, wheat, or other grain.  Some ofthe council, desirous of giving the House still further embarrassment,advis'd the governor not to accept provision, as not being the thinghe had demanded; but be reply'd, 'I shall take the money, for Iunderstand very well their meaning; other grain is gunpowder,'which he accordingly bought, and they never objected to it.<10>     <10> See the votes.--[Marg. note.]It was in allusion to this fact that, when in our fire company wefeared the success of our proposal in favour of the lottery, and Ihad said to my friend Mr. Syng, one of our members, 'If we fail,let us move the purchase of a fire-engine with the money; the Quakerscan have no objection to that; and then, if you nominate me and Iyou as a committee for that purpose, we will buy a great gun,which is certainly a fire-engine.' 'I see,' says he, 'you haveimprov'd by being so long in the Assembly; your equivocal projectwould be just a match for their wheat or other grain.'These embarrassments that the Quakers suffer'd from havingestablish'd and published it as one of their principles thatno kind of war was lawful, and which, being once published,they could not afterwards, however they might change their minds,easily get rid of, reminds me of what I think a more prudentconduct in another sect among us, that of the Dunkers.  I wasacquainted with one of its founders, Michael Welfare, soon after itappear'd. He complain'd to me that they were grievously calumniatedby the zealots of other persuasions, and charg'd with abominableprinciples and practices, to which they were utter strangers.I told him this had always been the case with new sects, and that,to put a stop to such abuse, I imagin'd it might be well to publishthe articles of their belief, and the rules of their discipline.He said that it had been propos'd among them, but not agreed to,for this reason:  'When we were first drawn together as a society,'says he, 'it had pleased God to enlighten our minds so far as to seethat some doctrines, which we once esteemed truths, were errors;and that others, which we had esteemed errors, were real truths.From time to time He has been pleased to afford us farther light,and our principles have been improving, and our errors diminishing.Now we are not sure that we are arrived at the end of this progression,and at the perfection of spiritual or theological knowledge;and we fear that, if we should once print our confession of faith,we should feel ourselves as if bound and confin'd by it, and perhapsbe unwilling to receive farther improvement, and our successors stillmore so, as conceiving what we their elders and founders had done, to besomething sacred, never to be departed from.'This modesty in a sect is perhaps a singular instance in the historyof mankind, every other sect supposing itself in possessionof all truth, and that those who differ are so far in the wrong;like a man traveling in foggy weather, those at some distancebefore him on the road he sees wrapped up in the fog, as well asthose behind him, and also the people in the fields on each side,but near him all appears clear, tho' in truth he is as muchin the fog as any of them.  To avoid this kind of embarrassment,the Quakers have of late years been gradually declining the publicservice in the Assembly and in the magistracy, choosing ratherto quit their power than their principle.In order of time, I should have mentioned before, that having, in 1742,invented an open stove for the better warming of rooms, and at the sametime saving fuel, as the fresh air admitted was warmed in entering,I made a present of the model to Mr. Robert Grace, one of my earlyfriends, who, having an iron-furnace, found the casting of the platesfor these stoves a profitable thing, as they were growing in demand.To promote that demand, I wrote and published a pamphlet, entitled 'AnAccount of the new-invented Pennsylvania Fireplaces; wherein theirConstruction and Manner of Operation is particularly explained;their Advantages above every other Method of warming Rooms demonstrated;and all Objections that have been raised against the Use of themanswered and obviated,' etc.  This pamphlet had a good effect.Gov'r. Thomas was so pleas'd with the construction of this stove,as described in it, that he offered to give me a patent for the solevending of them for a term of years; but I declin'd it from a principlewhich has ever weighed with me on such occasions, viz., That, as weenjoy great advantages from the inventions of others, we should beglad of an opportunity to serve others by any invention of ours;and this we should do freely and generously.An ironmonger in London however, assuming a good deal of my pamphlet,and working it up into his own, and making some small changesin the machine, which rather hurt its operation, got a patentfor it there, and made, as I was told, a little fortune by it.And this is not the only instance of patents taken out for myinventions by others, tho' not always with the same success, which Inever contested, as having no desire of profiting by patents myself,and hating disputes.  The use of these fireplaces in very many houses,both of this and the neighbouring colonies, has been, and is,a great saving of wood to the inhabitants.Peace being concluded, and the association business therefore atan end, I turn'd my thoughts again to the affair of establishingan academy.  The first step I took was to associate in the designa number of active friends, of whom the Junto furnished a good part;the next was to write and publish a pamphlet, entitled ProposalsRelating to the Education of Youth in Pennsylvania.  This Idistributed among the principal inhabitants gratis; and as soonas I could suppose their minds a little prepared by the perusalof it, I set on foot a subscription for opening and supportingan academy; it was to be paid in quotas yearly for five years;by so dividing it, I judg'd the subscription might be larger,and I believe it was so, amounting to no less, if I remember right,than five thousand pounds.In the introduction to these proposals, I stated their publication,not as an act of mine, but of some publick-spirited gentlemen,avoiding as much as I could, according to my usual rule, the presentingmyself to the publick as the author of any scheme for their benefit.The subscribers, to carry the project into immediate execution,chose out of their number twenty-four trustees, and appointedMr. Francis, then attorney-general, and myself to draw up constitutionsfor the government of the academy; which being done and signed,a house was hired, masters engag'd, and the schools opened, I think,in the same year, 1749.The scholars increasing fast, the house was soon found too small,and we were looking out for a piece of ground, properly situated,with intention to build, when Providence threw into our way a largehouse ready built, which, with a few alterations, might wellserve our purpose.  This was the building before mentioned,erected by the hearers of Mr. Whitefield, and was obtained for usin the following manner.It is to be noted that the contributions to this building beingmade by people of different sects, care was taken in the nominationof trustees, in whom the building and ground was to be vested,that a predominancy should not be given to any sect, lest in time thatpredominancy might be a means of appropriating the whole to the useof such sect, contrary to the original intention.  It was thereforethat one of each sect was appointed, viz., one Church-of-England man,one Presbyterian, one Baptist, one Moravian, etc., those, in caseof vacancy by death, were to fill it by election from amongthe contributors.  The Moravian happen'd not to please his colleagues,and on his death they resolved to have no other of that sect.The difficulty then was, how to avoid having two of some other sect,by means of the new choice.Several persons were named, and for that reason not agreed to.At length one mention'd me, with the observation that I was merelyan honest man, and of no sect at all, which prevail'd with themto chuse me.  The enthusiasm which existed when the house was builthad long since abated, and its trustees had not been able to procurefresh contributions for paying the ground-rent, and dischargingsome other debts the building had occasion'd, which embarrass'dthem greatly.  Being now a member of both sets of trustees,that for the building and that for the Academy, I had a goodopportunity of negotiating with both, and brought them finallyto an agreement, by which the trustees for the building were to cedeit to those of the academy, the latter undertaking to dischargethe debt, to keep for ever open in the building a large hallfor occasional preachers, according to the original intention,and maintain a free school for the instruction of poor children.Writings were accordingly drawn, and on paying the debts thetrustees of the academy were put in possession of the premises;and by dividing the great and lofty hall into stories, and differentrooms above and below for the several schools, and purchasing someadditional ground, the whole was soon made fit for our purpose,and the scholars remov'd into the building.  The care and troubleof agreeing with the workmen, purchasing materials, and superintendingthe work, fell upon me; and I went thro' it the more cheerfully,as it did not then interfere with my private business, having theyear before taken a very able, industrious, and honest partner,Mr. David Hall, with whose character I was well acquainted, as hehad work'd for me four years.  He took off my hands all care ofthe printing-office, paying me punctually my share of the profits.This partnership continued eighteen years, successfully for us both.The trustees of the academy, after a while, were incorporatedby a charter from the governor; their funds were increas'd bycontributions in Britain and grants of land from the proprietaries,to which the Assembly has since made considerable addition;and thus was established the present University of Philadelphia.I have been continued one of its trustees from the beginning,now near forty years, and have had the very great pleasure of seeinga number of the youth who have receiv'd their education in it,distinguish'd by their improv'd abilities, serviceable in publicstations and ornaments to their country.When I disengaged myself, as above mentioned, from private business,I flatter'd myself that, by the sufficient tho' moderate fortuneI had acquir'd, I had secured leisure during the rest of my lifefor philosophical studies and amusements.  I purchased allDr. Spence's apparatus, who had come from England to lecture here,and I proceeded in my electrical experiments with great alacrity;but the publick, now considering me as a man of leisure, laid holdof me for their purposes, every part of our civil government,and almost at the same time, imposing some duty upon me.The governor put me into the commission of the peace; the corporationof the city chose me of the common council, and soon after an alderman;and the citizens at large chose me a burgess to represent themin Assembly.  This latter station was the more agreeable to me,as I was at length tired with sitting there to hear debates,in which, as clerk, I could take no part, and which were oftenso unentertaining that I was induc'd to amuse myself with makingmagic squares or circles, or any thing to avoid weariness; and Iconceiv'd my becoming a member would enlarge my power of doing good.I would not, however, insinuate that my ambition was not flatter'd by allthese promotions; it certainly was; for, considering my low beginning,they were great things to me; and they were still more pleasing,as being so many spontaneous testimonies of the public good opinion,and by me entirely unsolicited.The office of justice of the peace I try'd a little, by attendinga few courts, and sitting on the bench to hear causes; but findingthat more knowledge of the common law than I possess'd was necessaryto act in that station with credit, I gradually withdrew from it,excusing myself by my being oblig'd to attend the higher dutiesof a legislator in the Assembly.  My election to this trust wasrepeated every year for ten years, without my ever asking anyelector for his vote, or signifying, either directly or indirectly,any desire of being chosen.  On taking my seat in the House,my son was appointed their clerk.The year following, a treaty being to be held with the Indiansat Carlisle, the governor sent a message to the House, proposing thatthey should nominate some of their members, to be join'd with somemembers of council, as commissioners for that purpose.<11> The Housenamed the speaker (Mr. Norris) and myself; and, being commission'd,we went to Carlisle, and met the Indians accordingly.     <11> See the votes to have this more correctly.          --[Marg. note.]As those people are extreamly apt to get drunk, and, when so,are very quarrelsome and disorderly, we strictly forbad the sellingany liquor to them; and when they complain'd of this restriction,we told them that if they would continue sober during the treaty,we would give them plenty of rum when business was over.They promis'd this, and they kept their promise, because they could getno liquor, and the treaty was conducted very orderly, and concludedto mutual satisfaction.  They then claim'd and receiv'd the rum; this wasin the afternoon; they were near one hundred men, women, and children,and were lodg'd in temporary cabins, built in the form of a square,just without the town.  In the evening, hearing a great noiseamong them, the commissioners walk'd out to see what was the matter.We found they had made a great bonfire in the middle of the square;they were all drunk, men and women, quarreling and fighting.Their dark-colour'd bodies, half naked, seen only by the gloomy lightof the bonfire, running after and beating one another with firebrands,accompanied by their horrid yellings, form'd a scene the mostresembling our ideas of hell that could well be imagin'd; there wasno appeasing the tumult, and we retired to our lodging.  At midnighta number of them came thundering at our door, demanding more rum,of which we took no notice.The next day, sensible they had misbehav'd in giving us that disturbance,they sent three of their old counselors to make their apology.The orator acknowledg'd the fault, but laid it upon the rum;and then endeavored to excuse the rum by saying, 'The Great Spirit,who made all things, made every thing for some use, and whatever usehe design'd any thing for, that use it should always be put to.Now, when he made rum, he said 'Let this be for the Indians to getdrunk with,' and it must be so.'  And, indeed, if it be the designof Providence to extirpate these savages in order to make roomfor cultivators of the earth, it seems not improbable that rum maybe the appointed means.  It has already annihilated all the tribeswho formerly inhabited the sea-coast.In 1751, Dr. Thomas Bond, a particular friend of mine, conceived the ideaof establishing a hospital in Philadelphia (a very beneficent design,which has been ascrib'd to me, but was originally his), for the receptionand cure of poor sick persons, whether inhabitants of the provinceor strangers.  He was zealous and active in endeavouring to procuresubscriptions for it, but the proposal being a novelty in America,and at first not well understood, he met with but small success.At length he came to me with the compliment that he found therewas no such thing as carrying a public-spirited project throughwithout my being concern'd in it.  'For,' says he, 'I am oftenask'd by those to whom I propose subscribing, Have you consulted
ESFJ	 upon this business?  And what does he think of it?And when I tell them that I have not (supposing it rather out of yourline), they do not subscribe, but say they will consider of it.'I enquired into the nature and probable utility of his scheme,and receiving from him a very satisfactory explanation, I not onlysubscrib'd to it myself, but engag'd heartily in the design of procuringsubscriptions from others.  Previously, however, to the solicitation,I endeavoured to prepare the minds of the people by writing on thesubject in the newspapers, which was my usual custom in such cases,but which he had omitted.The subscriptions afterwards were more free and generous;but, beginning to flag, I saw they would be insufficient withoutsome assistance from the Assembly, and therefore propos'd topetition for it, which was done.  The country members did not atfirst relish the project; they objected that it could only beserviceable to the city, and therefore the citizens alone shouldbe at the expense of it; and they doubted whether the citizensthemselves generally approv'd of it.  My allegation on the contrary,that it met with such approbation as to leave no doubt of ourbeing able to raise two thousand pounds by voluntary donations,they considered as a most extravagant supposition, and utterly impossible.On this I form'd my plan; and asking leave to bring in a bill forincorporating the contributors according to the prayer of their petition,and granting them a blank sum of money, which leave was obtainedchiefly on the consideration that the House could throw the bill outif they did not like it, I drew it so as to make the important clausea conditional one, viz., 'And be it enacted, by the authority aforesaid,that when the said contributors shall have met and chosen theirmanagers and treasurer, and shall have raised by their contributionsa capital stock of ----- value (the yearly interest of which is to beapplied to the accommodating of the sick poor in the said hospital,free of charge for diet, attendance, advice, and medicines), andshall make the same appear to the satisfaction of the speaker ofthe Assembly for the time being, that then it shall and may be lawfulfor the said speaker, and he is hereby required, to sign an orderon the provincial treasurer for the payment of two thousand pounds,in two yearly payments, to the treasurer of the said hospital,to be applied to the founding, building, and finishing of the same.'This condition carried the bill through; for the members, who hadoppos'd the grant, and now conceiv'd they might have the creditof being charitable without the expence, agreed to its passage;and then, in soliciting subscriptions among the people, we urg'dthe conditional promise of the law as an additional motive to give,since every man's donation would be doubled; thus the clausework'd both ways.  The subscriptions accordingly soon exceededthe requisite sum, and we claim'd and receiv'd the public gift,which enabled us to carry the design into execution.  A convenientand handsome building was soon erected; the institution hasby constant experience been found useful, and flourishes tothis day; and I do not remember any of my political manoeuvres,the success of which gave me at the time more pleasure, or wherein,after thinking of it, I more easily excus'd myself for having madesome use of cunning.It was about this time that another projector, the Rev. Gilbert Tennent,came to me with a request that I would assist him in procuringa subscription for erecting a new meeting-house. It was to be forthe use of a congregation he had gathered among the Presbyterians,who were originally disciples of Mr. Whitefield.  Unwilling tomake myself disagreeable to my fellow-citizens by too frequentlysoliciting their contributions, I absolutely refus'd. He thendesired I would furnish him with a list of the names of persons Iknew by experience to be generous and public-spirited. I thoughtit would be unbecoming in me, after their kind compliance withmy solicitations, to mark them out to be worried by other beggars,and therefore refus'd also to give such a list.  He then desir'd Iwould at least give him my advice.  'That I will readily do,' said I;'and, in the first place, I advise you to apply to all those whomyou know will give something; next, to those whom you are uncertainwhether they will give any thing or not, and show them the listof those who have given; and, lastly, do not neglect those who youare sure will give nothing, for in some of them you may be mistaken.'He laugh'd and thank'd me, and said he would take my advice.He did so, for he ask'd of everybody, and he obtained a muchlarger sum than he expected, with which he erected the capaciousand very elegant meeting-house that stands in Arch-street.Our city, tho' laid out with a beautiful regularity, the streets large,strait, and crossing each other at right angles, had the disgraceof suffering those streets to remain long unpav'd, and in wetweather the wheels of heavy carriages plough'd them into a quagmire,so that it was difficult to cross them; and in dry weather the dustwas offensive.  I had liv'd near what was call'd the Jersey Market,and saw with pain the inhabitants wading in mud while purchasingtheir provisions.  A strip of ground down the middle of thatmarket was at length pav'd with brick, so that, being oncein the market, they had firm footing, but were often over shoesin dirt to get there.  By talking and writing on the subject,I was at length instrumental in getting the street pav'd with stonebetween the market and the brick'd foot-pavement, that was on eachside next the houses.  This, for some time, gave an easy accessto the market dry-shod; but, the rest of the street not beingpav'd, whenever a carriage came out of the mud upon this pavement,it shook off and left its dirt upon it, and it was soon cover'dwith mire, which was not remov'd, the city as yet having no scavengers.After some inquiry I found a poor industrious man, who was willingto undertake keeping the pavement clean, by sweeping it twicea week, carrying off the dirt from before all the neighbours'doors, for the sum of sixpence per month, to be paid by each house.I then wrote and printed a paper setting forth the advantagesto the neighbourhood that might be obtain'd by this small expense;the greater ease in keeping our houses clean, so much dirt not beingbrought in by people's feet; the benefit to the shops by more custom,etc., etc., as buyers could more easily get at them; and by not having,in windy weather, the dust blown in upon their goods, etc., etc.I sent one of these papers to each house, and in a day or two wentround to see who would subscribe an agreement to pay these sixpences;it was unanimously sign'd, and for a time well executed.All the inhabitants of the city were delighted with the cleanlinessof the pavement that surrounded the market, it being a convenienceto all, and this rais'd a general desire to have all the streets paved,and made the people more willing to submit to a tax for that purpose.After some time I drew a bill for paving the city, and brought itinto the Assembly.  It was just before I went to England, in 1757,and did not pass till I was gone.<12> and then with an alterationin the mode of assessment, which I thought not for the better,but with an additional provision for lighting as well as pavingthe streets, which was a great improvement.  It was by a private person,the late Mr. John Clifton, his giving a sample of the utility of lamps,by placing one at his door, that the people were first impress'dwith the idea of enlighting all the city.  The honour of thispublic benefit has also been ascrib'd to me but it belongs trulyto that gentleman.  I did but follow his example, and have onlysome merit to claim respecting the form of our lamps, as differingfrom the globe lamps we were at first supply'd with from London.Those we found inconvenient in these respects:  they admittedno air below; the smoke, therefore, did not readily go out above,but circulated in the globe, lodg'd on its inside, and soonobstructed the light they were intended to afford; giving, besides,the daily trouble of wiping them clean; and an accidental strokeon one of them would demolish it, and render it totally useless.I therefore suggested the composing them of four flat panes,with a long funnel above to draw up the smoke, and crevicesadmitting air below, to facilitate the ascent of the smoke; by thismeans they were kept clean, and did not grow dark in a few hours,as the London lamps do, but continu'd bright till morning,and an accidental stroke would generally break but a single pane,easily repair'd.     <12> See votes.I have sometimes wonder'd that the Londoners did not, from theeffect holes in the bottom of the globe lamps us'd at Vauxhallhave in keeping them clean, learn to have such holes in theirstreet lamps.  But, these holes being made for another purpose,viz., to communicate flame more suddenly to the wick by a littleflax hanging down thro' them, the other use, of letting in air,seems not to have been thought of; and therefore, after the lamps havebeen lit a few hours, the streets of London are very poorly illuminated.The mention of these improvements puts me in mind of one I propos'd, whenin London, to Dr. Fothergill, who was among the best men I have known,and a great promoter of useful projects.  I had observ'd that the streets,when dry, were never swept, and the light dust carried away;but it was suffer'd to accumulate till wet weather reduc'd it to mud,and then, after lying some days so deep on the pavement that therewas no crossing but in paths kept clean by poor people with brooms,it was with great labour rak'd together and thrown up into cartsopen above, the sides of which suffer'd some of the slush at everyjolt on the pavement to shake out and fall, sometimes to the annoyanceof foot-passengers. The reason given for not sweeping the dustystreets was, that the dust would fly into the windows of shops and houses.An accidental occurrence had instructed me how much sweeping mightbe done in a little time.  I found at my door in Craven-street,one morning, a poor woman sweeping my pavement with a birch broom;she appeared very pale and feeble, as just come out of a fitof sickness.  I ask'd who employ'd her to sweep there; she said,'Nobody, but I am very poor and in distress, and I sweeps beforegentlefolkses doors, and hopes they will give me something.'  I bidher sweep the whole street clean, and I would give her a shilling;this was at nine o'clock; at 12 she came for the shilling.From the slowness I saw at first in her working, I could scarce believethat the work was done so soon, and sent my servant to examine it,who reported that the whole street was swept perfectly clean,and all the dust plac'd in the gutter, which was in the middle;and the next rain wash'd it quite away, so that the pavement and eventhe kennel were perfectly clean.I then judg'd that, if that feeble woman could sweep such a street inthree hours, a strong, active man might have done it in half the time.And here let me remark the convenience of having but one gutterin such a narrow street, running down its middle, instead of two,one on each side, near the footway; for where all the rain thatfalls on a street runs from the sides and meets in the middle,it forms there a current strong enough to wash away all the mud itmeets with; but when divided into two channels, it is often too weakto cleanse either, and only makes the mud it finds more fluid,so that the wheels of carriages and feet of horses throw and dash itupon the foot-pavement, which is thereby rendered foul and slippery,and sometimes splash it upon those who are walking.  My proposal,communicated to the good doctor, was as follows:'For the more effectual cleaning and keeping clean the streets ofLondon and Westminster, it is proposed that the several watchmen becontracted with to have the dust swept up in dry seasons, and the mudrak'd up at other times, each in the several streets and lanesof his round; that they be furnish'd with brooms and other properinstruments for these purposes, to be kept at their respective stands,ready to furnish the poor people they may employ in the service.'That in the dry summer months the dust be all swept up into heapsat proper distances, before the shops and windows of houses areusually opened, when the scavengers, with close-covered carts,shall also carry it all away.'That the mud, when rak'd up, be not left in heaps to be spreadabroad again by the wheels of carriages and trampling of horses,but that the scavengers be provided with bodies of carts, not plac'dhigh upon wheels, but low upon sliders, with lattice bottoms, which,being cover'd with straw, will retain the mud thrown into them,and permit the water to drain from it, whereby it will becomemuch lighter, water making the greatest part of its weight;these bodies of carts to be plac'd at convenient distances, and themud brought to them in wheel-barrows; they remaining where plac'dtill the mud is drain'd, and then horses brought to draw them away.'I have since had doubts of the practicability of the latter partof this proposal, on account of the narrowness of some streets,and the difficulty of placing the draining-sleds so as not to encumbertoo much the passage; but I am still of opinion that the former,requiring the dust to be swept up and carry'd away before the shopsare open, is very practicable in the summer, when the days are long;for, in walking thro' the Strand and Fleet-street one morning atseven o'clock, I observ'd there was not one shop open, tho' it hadbeen daylight and the sun up above three hours; the inhabitantsof London chusing voluntarily to live much by candle-light,and sleep by sunshine, and yet often complain, a little absurdly,of the duty on candles and the high price of tallow.Some may think these trifling matters not worth minding or relating;but when they consider that tho' dust blown into the eyesof a single person, or into a single shop on a windy day,is but of small importance, yet the great number of the instancesin a populous city, and its frequent repetitions give it weightand consequence, perhaps they will not censure very severely thosewho bestow some attention to affairs of this seemingly low nature.Human felicity is produc'd not so much by great pieces of goodfortune that seldom happen, as by little advantages that occurevery day.  Thus, if you teach a poor young man to shave himself,and keep his razor in order, you may contribute more to the happinessof his life than in giving him a thousand guineas.  The money may besoon spent, the regret only remaining of having foolishly consumed it;but in the other case, he escapes the frequent vexation of waitingfor barbers, and of their sometimes dirty fingers, offensive breaths,and dull razors; he shaves when most convenient to him, and enjoysdaily the pleasure of its being done with a good instrument.With these sentiments I have hazarded the few preceding pages,hoping they may afford hints which some time or other may be usefulto a city I love, having lived many years in it very happily,and perhaps to some of our towns in America.Having been for some time employed by the postmaster-generalof America as his comptroller in regulating several offices,and bringing the officers to account, I was, upon his deathin 1753, appointed, jointly with Mr. William Hunter, to succeed him,by a commission from the postmaster-general in England.  The Americanoffice never had hitherto paid any thing to that of Britain.We were to have six hundred pounds a year between us, if we could makethat sum out of the profits of the office.  To do this, a varietyof improvements were necessary; some of these were inevitably atfirst expensive, so that in the first four years the office becameabove nine hundred pounds in debt to us.  But it soon after beganto repay us; and before I was displac'd by a freak of the ministers,of which I shall speak hereafter, we had brought it to yield three timesas much clear revenue to the crown as the postoffice of Ireland.Since that imprudent transaction, they have receiv'd from it--not one farthing!The business of the postoffice occasion'd my taking a journey thisyear to New England, where the College of Cambridge, of theirown motion, presented me with the degree of Master of Arts.Yale College, in Connecticut, had before made me a similar compliment.Thus, without studying in any college, I came to partakeof their honours.  They were conferr'd in consideration of myimprovements and discoveries in the electric branch of natural philosophy.In 1754, war with France being again apprehended, a congressof commissioners from the different colonies was, by an orderof the Lords of Trade, to be assembled at Albany, there to conferwith the chiefs of the Six Nations concerning the means of defendingboth their country and ours.  Governor Hamilton, having receiv'dthis order, acquainted the House with it, requesting they wouldfurnish proper presents for the Indians, to be given on this occasion;and naming the speaker (Mr. Norris) and myself to join Mr. Thomas Pennand Mr. Secretary Peters as commissioners to act for Pennsylvania.The House approv'd the nomination, and provided the goods for the present,and tho' they did not much like treating out of the provinces;and we met the other commissioners at Albany about the middle of June.In our way thither, I projected and drew a plan for the unionof all the colonies under one government, so far as might benecessary for defense, and other important general purposes.As we pass'd thro' New York, I had there shown my project to Mr. JamesAlexander and Mr. Kennedy, two gentlemen of great knowledgein public affairs, and, being fortified by their approbation,I ventur'd to lay it before the Congress.  It then appeared thatseveral of the commissioners had form'd plans of the same kind.A previous question was first taken, whether a union shouldbe established, which pass'd in the affirmative unanimously.A committee was then appointed, one member from each colony,to consider the several plans and report.  Mine happen'dto be preferr'd, and, with a few amendments, was accordingly reported.By this plan the general government was to be administered by apresident-general, appointed and supported by the crown, and a grandcouncil was to be chosen by the representatives of the peopleof the several colonies, met in their respective assemblies.The debates upon it in Congress went on daily, hand in hand withthe Indian business.  Many objections and difficulties were started,but at length they were all overcome, and the plan was unanimouslyagreed to, and copies ordered to be transmitted to the Boardof Trade and to the assemblies of the several provinces.Its fate was singular:  the assemblies did not adopt it, as theyall thought there was too much prerogative in it, and in Englandit was judg'd to have too much of the democratic.The Board of Trade therefore did not approve of it, nor recommend itfor the approbation of his majesty; but another scheme was form'd,supposed to answer the same purpose better, whereby the governorsof the provinces, with some members of their respective councils,were to meet and order the raising of troops, building of forts,etc., and to draw on the treasury of Great Britain for the expense,which was afterwards to be refunded by an act of Parliament layinga tax on America.  My plan, with my reasons in support of it,is to be found among my political papers that are printed.Being the winter following in Boston, I had much conversation withGovernor Shirley upon both the plans.  Part of what passed between uson the occasion may also be seen among those papers.  The differentand contrary reasons of dislike to my plan makes me suspect that itwas really the true medium; and I am still of opinion it wouldhave been happy for both sides the water if it had been adopted.The colonies, so united, would have been sufficiently strong to havedefended themselves; there would then have been no need of troopsfrom England; of course, the subsequent pretence for taxing America,and the bloody contest it occasioned, would have been avoided.But such mistakes are not new; history is full of the errors of statesand princes.          Look round the habitable world, how few          Know their own good, or, knowing it, pursue!Those who govern, having much business on their hands, do notgenerally like to take the trouble of considering and carrying intoexecution new projects.  The best public measures are thereforeseldom adopted from previous wisdom, but forc'd by the occasion.The Governor of Pennsylvania, in sending it down to the Assembly,express'd his approbation of the plan, 'as appearing to himto be drawn up with great clearness and strength of judgment,and therefore recommended it as well worthy of their closest andmost serious attention.'  The House, however, by the managementof a certain member, took it up when I happen'd to be absent,which I thought not very fair, and reprobated it without payingany attention to it at all, to my no small mortification.In my journey to Boston this year, I met at New York with ournew governor, Mr. Morris, just arriv'd there from England, with whomI had been before intimately acquainted.  He brought a commissionto supersede Mr. Hamilton, who, tir'd with the disputes his proprietaryinstructions subjected him to, had resign'd. Mr. Morris ask'd meif I thought he must expect as uncomfortable an administration.I said, 'No; you may, on the contrary, have a very comfortable one,if you will only take care not to enter into any dispute withthe Assembly.'  'My dear friend,' says he, pleasantly, 'how canyou advise my avoiding disputes?  You know I love disputing;it is one of my greatest pleasures; however, to show the regardI have for your counsel, I promise you I will, if possible,avoid them.'  He had some reason for loving to dispute, being eloquent,an acute sophister, and, therefore, generally successful inargumentative conversation.  He had been brought up to it from a boy,his father, as I have heard, accustoming his children to dispute withone another for his diversion, while sitting at table after dinner;but I think the practice was not wise; for, in the course ofmy observation, these disputing, contradicting, and confuting peopleare generally unfortunate in their affairs.  They get victory sometimes,but they never get good will, which would be of more use to them.We parted, he going to Philadelphia, and I to Boston.In returning, I met at New York with the votes of the Assembly,by which it appear'd that, notwithstanding his promise to me,he and the House were already in high contention; and it was acontinual battle between them as long as he retain'd the government.I had my share of it; for, as soon as I got back to my seat inthe Assembly, I was put on every committee for answering his speechesand messages, and by the committees always desired to make the drafts.Our answers, as well as his messages, were often tart, and sometimesindecently abusive; and, as he knew I wrote for the Assembly,one might have imagined that, when we met, we could hardly avoidcutting throats; but he was so good-natur'd a man that no personaldifference between him and me was occasion'd by the contest, and weoften din'd together.One afternoon, in the height of this public quarrel, we met inthe street.  '
ESFJ	,' says he, 'you must go home with me and spendthe evening; I am to have some company that you will like;' and,taking me by the arm, he led me to his house.  In gay conversationover our wine, after supper, he told us, jokingly, that he muchadmir'd the idea of Sancho Panza, who, when it was proposed to givehim a government, requested it might be a government of blacks,as then, if he could not agree with his people, he might sell them.One of his friends, who sat next to me, says, '
ESFJ	, whydo you continue to side with these damn'd Quakers?  Had not youbetter sell them?  The proprietor would give you a good price.''The governor,' says I, 'has not yet blacked them enough.'He, indeed, had labored hard to blacken the Assembly in allhis messages, but they wip'd off his coloring as fast as helaid it on, and plac'd it, in return, thick upon his own face;so that, finding he was likely to be negrofied himself, he, as wellas Mr. Hamilton, grew tir'd of the contest, and quitted the government.<13>These public quarrels were all at bottom owing to the proprietaries,our hereditary governors, who, when any expense was to be incurredfor the defense of their province, with incredible meanness instructedtheir deputies to pass no act for levying the necessary taxes,unless their vast estates were in the same act expressly excused;and they had even taken bonds of these deputies to observesuch instructions.  The Assemblies for three years held out againstthis injustice, tho' constrained to bend at last.  At lengthCaptain Denny, who was Governor Morris's successor, ventured to disobeythose instructions; how that was brought about I shall show hereafter.     <13> My acts in Morris's time, military, etc.--[Marg. note.]But I am got forward too fast with my story:  there are still sometransactions to be mention'd that happened during the administrationof Governor Morris.War being in a manner commenced with France, the government ofMassachusetts Bay projected an attack upon Crown Point, and sentMr. Quincy to Pennsylvania, and Mr. Pownall, afterward Governor Pownall,to New York, to solicit assistance.  As I was in the Assembly,knew its temper, and was Mr. Quincy's countryman, he appli'd to mefor my influence and assistance.  I dictated his address to them,which was well receiv'd. They voted an aid of ten thousand pounds,to be laid out in provisions.  But the governor refusing hisassent to their bill (which included this with other sums grantedfor the use of the crown), unless a clause were inserted exemptingthe proprietary estate from bearing any part of the tax that wouldbe necessary, the Assembly, tho' very desirous of making their grantto New England effectual, were at a loss how to accomplish it.Mr. Quincy labored hard with the governor to obtain his assent,but he was obstinate.I then suggested a method of doing the business without the governor,by orders on the trustees of the Loan Office, which, by law,the Assembly had the right of drawing.  There was, indeed, little orno money at that time in the office, and therefore I propos'd thatthe orders should be payable in a year, and to bear an interestof five per cent.  With these orders I suppos'd the provisions mighteasily be purchas'd. The Assembly, with very little hesitation,adopted the proposal.  The orders were immediately printed, and Iwas one of the committee directed to sign and dispose of them.The fund for paying them was the interest of all the paper currencythen extant in the province upon loan, together with the revenuearising from the excise, which being known to be more than sufficient,they obtain'd instant credit, and were not only receiv'd in paymentfor the provisions, but many money'd people, who had cash lying by them,vested it in those orders, which they found advantageous, as they boreinterest while upon hand, and might on any occasion be used as money;so that they were eagerly all bought up, and in a few weeks none of themwere to be seen.  Thus this important affair was by my means compleated.My Quincy return'd thanks to the Assembly in a handsome memorial,went home highly pleas'd with the success of his embassy, and everafter bore for me the most cordial and affectionate friendship.The British government, not chusing to permit the union of the coloniesas propos'd at Albany, and to trust that union with their defense,lest they should thereby grow too military, and feel their own strength,suspicions and jealousies at this time being entertain'd of them,sent over General Braddock with two regiments of regular Englishtroops for that purpose.  He landed at Alexandria, in Virginia,and thence march'd to Frederictown, in Maryland, where he haltedfor carriages.  Our Assembly apprehending, from some information,that he had conceived violent prejudices against them, as averseto the service, wish'd me to wait upon him, not as from them,but as postmaster-general, under the guise of proposing to settlewith him the mode of conducting with most celerity and certaintythe despatches between him and the governors of the several provinces,with whom he must necessarily have continual correspondence, and ofwhich they propos'd to pay the expense.  My son accompanied me onthis journey.We found the general at Frederictown, waiting impatiently forthe return of those he had sent thro' the back parts of Marylandand Virginia to collect waggons.  I stayed with him several days,din'd with him daily, and had full opportunity of removingall his prejudices, by the information of what the Assembly hadbefore his arrival actually done, and were still willing to do,to facilitate his operations.  When I was about to depart, the returnsof waggons to be obtained were brought in, by which it appear'dthat they amounted only to twenty-five, and not all of those werein serviceable condition.  The general and all the officers weresurpris'd, declar'd the expedition was then at an end, being impossible,and exclaim'd against the ministers for ignorantly landing them in acountry destitute of the means of conveying their stores, baggage,etc., not less than one hundred and fifty waggons being necessary.I happened to say I thought it was a pity they had not been landedrather in Pennsylvania, as in that country almost every farmer hadhis waggon.  The general eagerly laid hold of my words, and said,'Then you, sir, who are a man of interest there, can probablyprocure them for us; and I beg you will undertake it.'  I ask'dwhat terms were to be offer'd the owners of the waggons; and I wasdesir'd to put on paper the terms that appeared to me necessary.This I did, and they were agreed to, and a commission and instructionsaccordingly prepar'd immediately.  What those terms were will appearin the advertisement I publish'd as soon as I arriv'd at Lancaster,which being, from the great and sudden effect it produc'd, a pieceof some curiosity, I shall insert it at length, as follows:               'ADVERTISEMENT.                        'LANCASTER, April 26, 1755.'Whereas, one hundred and fifty waggons, with four horses to each waggon,and fifteen hundred saddle or pack horses, are wanted for the serviceof his majesty's forces now about to rendezvous at Will's Creek,and his excellency General Braddock having been pleased to empowerme to contract for the hire of the same, I hereby give noticethat I shall attend for that purpose at Lancaster from this dayto next Wednesday evening, and at York from next Thursday morningtill Friday evening, where I shall be ready to agree for waggonsand teams, or single horses, on the following terms, viz.: I. Thatthere shall be paid for each waggon, with four good horses anda driver, fifteen shillings per diem; and for each able horsewith a pack-saddle, or other saddle and furniture, two shillingsper diem; and for each able horse without a saddle, eighteen penceper diem.  2.  That the pay commence from the time of their joiningthe forces at Will's Creek, which must be on or before the 20thof May ensuing, and that a reasonable allowance be paid over andabove for the time necessary for their travelling to Will's Creekand home again after their discharge.  3.  Each waggon and team,and every saddle or pack horse, is to be valued by indifferESFJersons chosen between me and the owner; and in case of the loss ofany waggon, team, or other horse in the service, the price accordingto such valuation is to be allowed and paid.  4.  Seven days'pay is to be advanced and paid in hand by me to the owner of eachwaggon and team, or horse, at the time of contracting, if required,and the remainder to be paid by General Braddock, or by the paymasterof the army, at the time of their discharge, or from time to time,as it shall be demanded.  5.  No drivers of waggons, or personstaking care of the hired horses, are on any account to be calledupon to do the duty of soldiers, or be otherwise employed than inconducting or taking care of their carriages or horses.  6.  All oats,Indian corn, or other forage that waggons or horses bring to the camp,more than is necessary for the subsistence of the horses, is to betaken for the use of the army, and a reasonable price paid for the same.'Note.--My son, William

'To the inhabitants of the Counties of Lancaster,                    York and Cumberland.'Friends and Countrymen,'Being occasionally at the camp at Frederic a few days since,I found the general and officers extremely exasperated on accountof their not being supplied with horses and carriages, which hadbeen expected from this province, as most able to furnish them;but, through the dissensions between our governor and Assembly,money had not been provided, nor any steps taken for that purpose.'It was proposed to send an armed force immediately into these counties,to seize as many of the best carriages and horses as should be wanted,and compel as many persons into the service as would be necessaryto drive and take care of them.'I apprehended that the progress of British soldiers through thesecounties on such an occasion, especially considering the temperthey are in, and their resentment against us, would be attendedwith many and great inconveniences to the inhabitants, and thereforemore willingly took the trouble of trying first what might be doneby fair and equitable means.  The people of these back countieshave lately complained to the Assembly that a sufficient currencywas wanting; you have an opportunity of receiving and dividingamong you a very considerable sum; for, if the service of thisexpedition should continue, as it is more than probable it will,for one hundred and twenty days, the hire of these waggonsand horses will amount to upward of thirty thousand pounds,which will be paid you in silver and gold of the king's money.'The service will be light and easy, for the army will scarce marchabove twelve miles per day, and the waggons and baggage-horses, asthey carry those things that are absolutely necessary to the welfareof the army, must march with the army, and no faster; and are,for the army's sake, always placed where they can be most secure,whether in a march or in a camp.'If you are really, as I believe you are, good and loyal subjectsto his majesty, you may now do a most acceptable service, and make iteasy to yourselves; for three or four of such as can not separatelyspare from the business of their plantations a waggon and fourhorses and a driver, may do it together, one furnishing the waggon,another one or two horses, and another the driver, and divide the payproportionately between you; but if you do not this service to yourking and country voluntarily, when such good pay and reasonableterms are offered to you, your loyalty will be strongly suspected.The king's business must be done; so many brave troops, come so farfor your defense, must not stand idle through your backwardnessto do what may be reasonably expected from you; waggons and horsesmust be had; violent measures will probably be used, and youwill be left to seek for a recompense where you can find it,and your case, perhaps, be little pitied or regarded.'I have no particular interest in this affair, as, except thesatisfaction of endeavoring to do good, I shall have only my labourfor my pains.  If this method of obtaining the waggons and horsesis not likely to succeed, I am obliged to send word to the generalin fourteen days; and I suppose Sir John St. Clair, the hussar,with a body of soldiers, will immediately enter the provincefor the purpose, which I shall be sorry to hear, because Iam very sincerely and truly your friend and well-wisher, B. FRANKLIN.'I received of the general about eight hundred pounds, to bedisbursed in advance-money to the waggon owners, etc.; but, that sumbeing insufficient, I advanc'd upward of two hundred pounds more,and in two weeks the one hundred and fifty waggons, with two hundredand fifty-nine carrying horses, were on their march for the camp.The advertisement promised payment according to the valuation,in case any waggon or horse should be lost.  The owners, however,alleging they did not know General Braddock, or what dependencemight be had on his promise, insisted on my bond for the performance,which I accordingly gave them.While I was at the camp, supping one evening with the officersof Colonel Dunbar's regiment, he represented to me his concernfor the subalterns, who, he said, were generally not in affluence,and could ill afford, in this dear country, to lay in the storesthat might be necessary in so long a march, thro' a wilderness,where nothing was to be purchas'd. I commiserated their case,and resolved to endeavor procuring them some relief.  I said nothing,however, to him of my intention, but wrote the next morning to thecommittee of the Assembly, who had the disposition of some public money,warmly recommending the case of these officers to their consideration,and proposing that a present should be sent them of necessariesand refreshments.  My son, who had some experience of a camp life,and of its wants, drew up a list for me, which I enclos'd in my letter.The committee approv'd, and used such diligence that, conducted bymy son, the stores arrived at the camp as soon as the waggons.They consisted of twenty parcels, each containing6 lbs. loaf sugar.                1 Gloucester cheese.6 lbs. good Muscovado do.         1 kegg containing 20 lbs. good1 lb. good green tea.             butter.1 lb. good bohea do.              2 doz. old Madeira wine.6 lbs. good ground coffee.        2 gallons Jamaica spirits.6 lbs. chocolate.                 1 bottle flour of mustard.1-2 cwt. best white biscuit.      2 well-cur'd hams.1-2 lb. pepper.                   1-2 dozen dry'd tongues.1 quart best white wine vinegar   6 lbs. rice.                                  6 lbs. raisins.These twenty parcels, well pack'd, were placed on as many horses,each parcel, with the horse, being intended as a present forone officer.  They were very thankfully receiv'd, and the kindnessacknowledg'd by letters to me from the colonels of both regiments,in the most grateful terms.  The general, too, was highly satisfiedwith my conduct in procuring him the waggons, etc., and readilypaid my account of disbursements, thanking me repeatedly,and requesting my farther assistance in sending provisions after him.I undertook this also, and was busily employ'd in it till we heardof his defeat, advancing for the service of my own money, upwards ofone thousand pounds sterling, of which I sent him an account.It came to his hands, luckily for me, a few days before the battle,and he return'd me immediately an order on the paymaster for the roundsum of one thousand pounds, leaving the remainder to the next account.I consider this payment as good luck, having never been ableto obtain that remainder, of which more hereafter.This general was, I think, a brave man, and might probably havemade a figure as a good officer in some European war.  But he hadtoo much self-confidence, too high an opinion of the validity ofregular troops, and too mean a one of both Americans and Indians.George Croghan, our Indian interpreter, join'd him on his marchwith one hundred of those people, who might have been of great useto his army as guides, scouts, etc., if he had treated them kindly;but he slighted and neglected them, and they gradually left him.In conversation with him one day, he was giving me some accountof his intended progress.  'After taking Fort Duquesne,' says he,'I am to proceed to Niagara; and, having taken that, to Frontenac,if the season will allow time; and I suppose it will, for Duquesnecan hardly detain me above three or four days; and then I see nothingthat can obstruct my march to Niagara.'  Having before revolv'din my mind the long line his army must make in their march by avery narrow road, to be cut for them thro' the woods and bushes,and also what I had read of a former defeat of fifteen hundred French,who invaded the Iroquois country, I had conceiv'd some doubts and somefears for the event of the campaign.  But I ventur'd only to say,'To be sure, sir, if you arrive well before Duquesne, with thesefine troops, so well provided with artillery, that place not yetcompleatly fortified, and as we hear with no very strong garrison,can probably make but a short resistance.  The only danger I apprehendof obstruction to your march is from ambuscades of Indians, who,by constant practice, are dexterous in laying and executing them;and the slender line, near four miles long, which your army must make,may expose it to be attack'd by surprise in its flanks, and to becut like a thread into several pieces, which, from their distance,can not come up in time to support each other.'He smil'd at my ignorance, and reply'd, 'These savages may, indeed,be a formidable enemy to your raw American militia, but uponthe king's regular and disciplin'd troops, sir, it is impossiblethey should make any impression.'  I was conscious of an improprietyin my disputing with a military man in matters of his profession,and said no more.  The enemy, however, did not take the advantageof his army which I apprehended its long line of march expos'd it to,but let it advance without interruption till within nine milesof the place; and then, when more in a body (for it had just passeda river, where the front had halted till all were come over), andin a more open part of the woods than any it had pass'd, attack'dits advanced guard by a heavy fire from behind trees and bushes,which was the first intelligence the general had of an enemy'sbeing near him.  This guard being disordered, the general hurriedthe troops up to their assistance, which was done in great confusion,thro' waggons, baggage, and cattle; and presently the fire came upontheir flank:  the officers, being on horseback, were more easilydistinguish'd, pick'd out as marks, and fell very fast; and the soldierswere crowded together in a huddle, having or hearing no orders,and standing to be shot at till two-thirds of them were killed;and then, being seiz'd with a panick, the whole fled with precipitation.The waggoners took each a horse out of his team and scamper'd;their example was immediately followed by others; so that allthe waggons, provisions, artillery, and stores were left to the enemy.The general, being wounded, was brought off with difficulty;his secretary, Mr. Shirley, was killed by his side; and outof eighty-six officers, sixty-three were killed or wounded,and seven hundred and fourteen men killed out of eleven hundred.These eleven hundred had been picked men from the whole army;the rest had been left behind with Colonel Dunbar, who was to followwith the heavier part of the stores, provisions, and baggage.The flyers, not being pursu'd, arriv'd at Dunbar's camp,and the panick they brought with them instantly seiz'd himand all his people; and, tho' he had now above one thousand men,and the enemy who had beaten Braddock did not at most exceedfour hundred Indians and French together, instead of proceeding,and endeavoring to recover some of the lost honour, he orderedall the stores, ammunition, etc., to be destroy'd, that he mighthave more horses to assist his flight towards the settlements,and less lumber to remove.  He was there met with requests fromthe governors of Virginia, Maryland, and Pennsylvania, that he wouldpost his troops on the frontiers, so as to afford some protectionto the inhabitants; but he continu'd his hasty march thro'all the country, not thinking himself safe till he arriv'dat Philadelphia, where the inhabitants could protect him.  This wholetransaction gave us Americans the first suspicion that our exaltedideas of the prowess of British regulars had not been well founded.In their first march, too, from their landing till they got beyondthe settlements, they had plundered and stripped the inhabitants,totally ruining some poor families, besides insulting, abusing,and confining the people if they remonstrated.  This was enoughto put us out of conceit of such defenders, if we had reallywanted any.  How different was the conduct of our French friendsin 1781, who, during a march thro' the most inhabited part of ourcountry from Rhode Island to Virginia, near seven hundred miles,occasioned not the smallest complaint for the loss of a pig,a chicken, or even an apple.Captain Orme, who was one of the general's aids-de-camp, and,being grievously wounded, was brought off with him, and continu'dwith him to his death, which happen'd in a few days, told me thathe was totally silent all the first day, and at night only said,'Who would have thought it?'  That he was silent again the following day,saying only at last, 'We shall better know how to deal with themanother time;' and dy'd in a few minutes after.The secretary's papers, with all the general's orders,instructions, and correspondence, falling into the enemy's hands,they selected and translated into French a number of the articles,which they printed, to prove the hostile intentions of the Britishcourt before the declaration of war.  Among these I saw some lettersof the general to the ministry, speaking highly of the great serviceI had rendered the army, and recommending me to their notice.David Hume, too, who was some years after secretary to Lord Hertford,when minister in France, and afterward to General Conway, when secretaryof state, told me he had seen among the papers in that office,letters from Braddock highly recommending me.  But, the expeditionhaving been unfortunate, my service, it seems, was not thoughtof much value, for those recommendations were never of any use to me.As to rewards from himself, I ask'd only one, which was, that he wouldgive orders to his officers not to enlist any more of our bought servants,and that he would discharge such as had been already enlisted.This he readily granted, and several were accordingly return'dto their masters, on my application.  Dunbar, when the commanddevolv'd on him, was not so generous.  He being at Philadelphia,on his retreat, or rather flight, I apply'd to him for the dischargeof the servants of three poor farmers of Lancaster county that hehad enlisted, reminding him of the late general's orders on that bead.He promised me that, if the masters would come to him at Trenton,where he should be in a few days on his march to New York,he would there deliver their men to them.  They accordingly were atthe expense and trouble of going to Trenton, and there he refus'dto perform his promise, to their great loss and disappointment.As soon as the loss of the waggons and horses was generally known,all the owners came upon me for the valuation which I had given bondto pay.  Their demands gave me a great deal of trouble, my acquaintingthem that the money was ready in the paymaster's hands, but thatorders for paying it must first be obtained from General Shirley,and my assuring them that I had apply'd to that general by letter;but, he being at a distance, an answer could not soon be receiv'd,and they must have patience, all this was not sufficient to satisfy,and some began to sue me.  General Shirley at length relieved mefrom this terrible situation by appointing commissioners to examinethe claims, and ordering payment.  They amounted to near twentythousand pound, which to pay would have ruined me.Before we had the news of this defeat, the two Doctors Bond cameto me with a subscription paper for raising money to defraythe expense of a grand firework, which it was intended to exhibitat a rejoicing on receipt of the news of our taking Fort Duquesne.I looked grave, and said it would, I thought, be time enoughto prepare for the rejoicing when we knew we should have occasionto rejoice.  They seem'd surpris'd that I did not immediatelycomply with their proposal.  'Why the d--l!' says one of them,'you surely don't suppose that the fort will not be taken?''I don't know that it will not be taken, but I know that the eventsof war are subject to great uncertainty.'  I gave them the reasonsof my doubting; the subscription was dropt, and the projectors therebymissed the mortification they would have undergone if the fireworkhad been prepared.  Dr. Bond, on some other occasion afterward,said that he did not like 
ESFJ	's forebodings.Governor Morris, who had continually worried the Assembly with messageafter message before the defeat of Braddock, to beat them intothe making of acts to raise money for the defense of the province,without taxing, among others, the proprietary estates, and hadrejected all their bills for not having such an exempting clause,now redoubled his attacks with more hope of success, the dangerand necessity being greater.  The Assembly, however, continu'd firm,believing they had justice on their side, and that it wouldbe giving up an essential right if they suffered the governorto amend their money-bills. In one of the last, indeed, which wasfor granting fifty thousand pounds, his propos'd amendment wasonly of a single word.  The bill expressed 'that all estates,real and personal, were to be taxed, those of the proprietariesnot excepted.'  His amendment was, for not read only:  a small,but very material alteration.  However, when the news of thisdisaster reached England, our friends there, whom we had taken careto furnish with all the Assembly's answers to the governor's messages,rais'd a clamor against the proprietaries for their meanness andinjustice in giving their governor such instructions; some goingso far as to say that, by obstructing the defense of their province,they forfeited their right to it.  They were intimidated by this,and sent orders to their receiver-general to add five thousandpounds of their money to whatever sum might be given by the Assemblyfor such purpose.This, being notified to the House, was accepted in lieu of their shareof a general tax, and a new bill was form'd, with an exempting clause,which passed accordingly.  By this act I was appointed one of thecommissioners for disposing of the money, sixty thousand pounds.I had been active in modelling the bill and procuring its passage,and had, at the same time, drawn a bill for establishingand disciplining of a voluntary militia, which I carried thro'the House without much difficulty, as care was taken in it toleave the Quakers at their liberty.  To promote the associationnecessary to form the militia, I wrote a dialogue,<14> statingand answering all the objections I could think of to such a militia,which was printed, and had, as I thought, great effect.     <14> This dialogue and the militia act are in the          'Gentleman's Magazine' for February and March, 1756.           --[Marg. note.]While the several companies in the city and country were formingand learning their exercise, the governor prevail'd with me to takecharge of our North-western frontier, which was infested by the enemy,and provide for the defense of the inhabitants by raising troops andbuilding a line of forts.  I undertook this military business, tho' I didnot conceive myself well qualified for it.  He gave me a commissionwith full powers, and a parcel of blank commissions for officers,to be given to whom I thought fit.  I had but little difficultyin raising men, having soon five hundred and sixty under my command.My son, who had in the preceding war been an officer in the armyrais'd against Canada, was my aid-de-camp, and of great use to me.The Indians had burned Gnadenhut, a village settled by the Moravians,and massacred the inhabitants; but the place was thought a goodsituation for one of the forts.In order to march thither, I assembled the companies at Bethlehem,the chief establishment of those people.  I was surprised to findit in so good a posture of defense; the destruction of Gnadenhuthad made them apprehend danger.  The principal buildings weredefended by a stockade; they had purchased a quantity of arms andammunition from New York, and had even plac'd quantities of smallpaving stones between the windows of their high stone houses,for their women to throw down upon the heads of any Indiansthat should attempt to force into them.  The armed brethren, too,kept watch, and reliev'd as methodically as in any garrison town.In conversation with the bishop, Spangenberg, I mention'd thismy surprise; for, knowing they had obtained an act of Parliamentexempting them from military duties in the colonies, I hadsuppos'd they were conscientiously scrupulous of bearing arms.He answer'd me that it was not one of their established principles,but that, at the time of their obtaining that act, it was thoughtto be a principle with many of their people.  On this occasion,however, they, to their surprise, found it adopted by but a few.It seems they were either deceiv'd in themselves, or deceiv'dthe Parliament; but common sense, aided by present danger,will sometimes be too strong for whimsical opinions.It was the beginning of January when we set out upon this businessof building forts.  I sent one detachment toward the Minisink,with instructions to erect one for the security of that upper part ofthe country, and another to the lower part, with similar instructions;and I concluded to go myself with the rest of my force to Gnadenhut,where a fort was tho't more immediately necessary.  The Moraviansprocur'd me five waggons for our tools, stores, baggage, etc.Just before we left Bethlehem, eleven farmers, who had been drivenfrom their plantations by the Indians, came to me requesting a supplyof firearms, that they might go back and fetch off their cattle.I gave them each a gun with suitable ammunition.  We had not march'dmany miles before it began to rain, and it continued raining all day;there were no habitations on the road to shelter us, till we arriv'dnear night at the house of a German, where, and in his barn,we were all huddled together, as wet as water could make us.It was well we were not attack'd in our march, for our arms were ofthe most ordinary sort, and our men could not keep their gun locks dry.The Indians are dextrous in contrivances for that purpose, which wehad not.  They met that day the eleven poor farmers above mentioned,and killed ten of them.  The one who escap'd inform'd that his andhis companions' guns would not go off, the priming being wet withthe rain.The next day being fair, we continu'd our march, and arriv'd atthe desolated Gnadenhut.  There was a saw-mill near, round which wereleft several piles of boards, with which we soon hutted ourselves;an operation the more necessary at that inclement season, as wehad no tents.  Our first work was to bury more effectually the deadwe found there, who had been half interr'd by the country people.The next morning our fort was plann'd and mark'd out, the circumferencemeasuring four hundred and fifty-five feet, which would requireas many palisades to be made of trees, one with another,of a foot diameter each.  Our axes, of which we had seventy,were immediately set to work to cut down trees, and, our menbeing dextrous in the use of them, great despatch was made.Seeing the trees fall so fast, I had the curiosity to look at my watchwhen two men began to cut at a pine; in six minutes they had it uponthe ground, and I found it of fourteen inches diameter.  Each pinemade three palisades of eighteen feet long, pointed at one end.While these were preparing, our other men dug a trench all round,of three feet deep, in which the palisades were to be planted;and, our waggons, the bodys being taken off, and the fore and hindwheels separated by taking out the pin which united the two partsof the perch, we had ten carriages, with two horses each, to bringthe palisades from the woods to the spot.  When they were set up,our carpenters built a stage of boards all round within, about sixfeet high, for the men to stand on when to fire thro' the loopholes.We had one swivel gun, which we mounted on one of the angles,and fir'd it as soon as fix'd, to let the Indians know, if anywere within hearing, that we had such pieces; and thus our fort,if such a magnificent name may be given to so miserable a stockade,was finish'd in a week, though it rain'd so hard every other daythat the men could not work.This gave me occasion to observe, that, when men are employ'd, theyare best content'd; for on the days they worked they were good-natur'dand cheerful, and, with the consciousness of having done a goodday's work, they spent the evening jollily; but on our idle daysthey were mutinous and quarrelsome, finding fault with their pork,the bread, etc., and in continual ill-humor, which put me in mindof a sea-captain, whose rule it was to keep his men constantlyat work; and, when his mate once told him that they had doneevery thing, and there was nothing further to employ them about,'Oh,' says he, 'Make them scour the anchor.'This kind of fort, however contemptible, is a sufficient defenseagainst Indians, who have no cannon.  Finding ourselves now postedsecurely, and having a place to retreat to on occasion, we ventur'dout in parties to scour the adjacent country.  We met with no Indians,but we found the places on the neighboring hills where they had lainto watch our proceedings.  There was an art in their contrivanceof those places, that seems worth mention.  It being winter, a firewas necessary for them; but a common fire on the surface of the groundwould by its light have discovered their position at a distance.They had therefore dug holes in the ground about three feet diameter,and somewhat deeper; we saw where they had with their hatchets cutoff the charcoal from the sides of burnt logs lying in the woods.With these coals they had made small fires in the bottom ofthe holes, and we observ'd among the weeds and grass the printsof their bodies, made by their laying all round, with their legshanging down in the holes to keep their feet warm, which, with them,is an essential point.  This kind of fire, so manag'd, could notdiscover them, either by its light, flame, sparks, or even smoke:it appear'd that their number was not great, and it seems they sawwe were too many to be attacked by them with prospect of advantage.We had for our chaplain a zealous Presbyterian minister, Mr. Beatty,who complained to me that the men did not generally attend his prayersand exhortations.  When they enlisted, they were promised, besides payand provisions, a gill of rum a day, which was punctually serv'dout to them, half in the morning, and the other half in the evening;and I observ'd they were as punctual in attending to receive it;upon which I said to Mr. Beatty, 'It is, perhaps, below the dignityof your profession to act as steward of the rum, but if you were to dealit out and only just after prayers, you would have them all about you.'He liked the tho't, undertook the office, and, with the help of afew hands to measure out the liquor, executed it to satisfaction,and never were prayers more generally and more punctually attended;so that I thought this method preferable to the punishment inflictedby some military laws for non-attendance on divine service.I had hardly finish'd this business, and got my fort well stor'dwith provisions, when I receiv'd a letter from the governor,acquainting me that he had call'd the Assembly, and wished myattendance there, if the posture of affairs on the frontierswas such that my remaining there was no longer necessary.My friends, too, of the Assembly, pressing me by their letters to be,if possible, at the meeting, and my three intended forts beingnow compleated, and the inhabitants contented to remain on their farmsunder that protection, I resolved to return; the more willingly,as a New England officer, Colonel Clapham, experienced in Indian war,being on a visit to our establishment, consented to accept the command.I gave him a commission, and, parading the garrison, had itread before them, and introduc'd him to them as an officer who,from his skill in military affairs, was much more fit to command themthan myself; and, giving them a little exhortation, took my leave.I was escorted as far as Bethlehem, where I rested a few days torecover from the fatigue I had undergone.  The first night, being ina good bed, I could hardly sleep, it was so different from my hardlodging on the floor of our hut at Gnaden wrapt only in a blanket or two.While at Bethlehem, I inquir'd a little into the practice ofthe Moravians:  some of them had accompanied me, and all were verykind to me.  I found they work'd for a common stock, eat at commontables, and slept in common dormitories, great numbers together.In the dormitories I observed loopholes, at certain distances allalong just under the ceiling, which I thought judiciously placedfor change of air.  I was at their church, where I was entertain'dwith good musick, the organ being accompanied with violins, hautboys,flutes, clarinets, etc.  I understood that their sermons were notusually preached to mixed congregations of men, women, and children,as is our common practice, but that they assembled sometimesthe married men, at other times their wives, then the young men,the young women, and the little children, each division by itself.The sermon I heard was to the latter, who came in and were plac'd in rowson benches; the boys under the conduct of a young man, their tutor,and the girls conducted by a young woman.  The discourse seem'dwell adapted to their capacities, and was deliver'd in a pleasing,familiar manner, coaxing them, as it were, to be good.  They behav'dvery orderly, but looked pale and unhealthy, which made me suspectthey were kept too much within doors, or not allow'd sufficient exercise.I inquir'd concerning the Moravian marriages, whether the reportwas true that they were by lot.  I was told that lots were us'donly in particular cases; that generally, when a young man foundhimself dispos'd to marry, he inform'd the elders of his class,who consulted the elder ladies that govern'd the young women.As these elders of the different sexes were well acquaintedwith the tempers and dispositions of their respective pupils,they could best judge what matches were suitable, and their judgmentswere generally acquiesc'd in; but if, for example, it should happenthat two or three young women were found to be equally properfor the young man, the lot was then recurred to.  I objected,if the matches are not made by the mutual choice of the parties,some of them may chance to be very unhappy.  'And so they may,'answer'd my informer, 'if you let the parties chuse for themselves;'which, indeed, I could not deny.Being returned to Philadelphia, I found the association wenton swimmingly, the inhabitants that were not Quakers having prettygenerally come into it, formed themselves into companies, and chosetheir captains, lieutenants, and ensigns, according to the new law.Dr. B. visited me, and gave me an account of the pains he had takento spread a general good liking to the law, and ascribed much tothose endeavors.  I had had the vanity to ascribe all to my Dialogue;however, not knowing but that he might be in the right, I let him enjoyhis opinion, which I take to be generally the best way in such cases.The officers, meeting, chose me to be colonel of the regiment,which I this time accepted.  I forget how many companies we had,but we paraded about twelve hundred well-looking men, with a companyof artillery, who had been furnished with six brass field-pieces,which they had become so expert in the use of as to fire twelve timesin a minute.  The first time I reviewed my regiment they accompanied meto my house, and would salute me with some rounds fired before my door,which shook down and broke several glasses of my electrical apparatus.And my new honour proved not much less brittle; for all ourcommissions were soon after broken by a repeal of the law in England.During this short time of my colonelship, being about to set out ona journey to Virginia, the officers of my regiment took it into theirheads that it would be proper for them to escort me out of town,as far as the Lower Ferry.  Just as I was getting on horseback theycame to my door, between thirty and forty, mounted, and all intheir uniforms.  I had not been previously acquainted with the project,or I should have prevented it, being naturally averse to the assumingof state on any occasion; and I was a good deal chagrin'd attheir appearance, as I could not avoid their accompanying me.What made it worse was, that, as soon as we began to move,they drew their swords and rode with them naked all the way.Somebody wrote an account of this to the proprietor, and it gave himgreat offense.  No such honor had been paid him when in the province,nor to any of his governors; and he said it was only proper toprinces of the blood royal, which may be true for aught I know,who was, and still am, ignorant of the etiquette in such cases.This silly affair, however, greatly increased his rancour against me,which was before not a little, on account of my conduct in theAssembly respecting the exemption of his estate from taxation,which I had always oppos'd very warmly, and not without severereflections on his meanness and injustice of contending for it.He accused me to the ministry as being the great obstacle tothe king's service, preventing, by my influence in the House,the proper form of the bills for raising money, and he instancedthis parade with my officers as a proof of my having an intentionto take the government of the province out of his hands by force.He also applied to Sir Everard Fawkener, the postmaster-general,to deprive me of my office; but it had no other effect than to procurefrom Sir Everard a gentle admonition.Notwithstanding the continual wrangle between the governorand the House, in which I, as a member, had so large a share,there still subsisted a civil intercourse between that gentlemanand myself, and we never had any personal difference.  I havesometimes since thought that his little or no resentment against me,for the answers it was known I drew up to his messages, might bethe effect of professional habit, and that, being bred a lawyer,he might consider us both as merely advocates for contending clientsin a suit, he for the proprietaries and I for the Assembly.He would, therefore, sometimes call in a friendly way to advisewith me on difficult points, and sometimes, tho' not often,take my advice.We acted in concert to supply Braddock's army with provisions;and, when the shocking news arrived of his defeat, the governor sentin haste for me, to consult with him on measures for preventingthe desertion of the back counties.  I forget now the adviceI gave; but I think it was, that Dunbar should be written to,and prevail'd with, if possible, to post his troops on the frontiersfor their protection, till, by re-enforcements from the colonies,he might be able to proceed on the expedition.  And, after my returnfrom the frontier, he would have had me undertake the conductof such an expedition with provincial troops, for the reductionof Fort Duquesne, Dunbar and his men being otherwise employed; and heproposed to commission me as general.  I had not so good an opinionof my military abilities as he profess'd to have, and I believe hisprofessions must have exceeded his real sentiments; but probably hemight think that my popularity would facilitate the raising of the men,and my influence in Assembly, the grant of money to pay them,and that, perhaps, without taxing the proprietary estate.  Finding menot so forward to engage as he expected, the project was dropt,and he soon after left the government, being superseded by Captain Denny.Before I proceed in relating the part I had in public affairs underthis new governor's administration, it may not be amiss here to givesome account of the rise and progress of my philosophical reputation.In 1746, being at Boston, I met there with a Dr. Spence, who was latelyarrived from Scotland, and show'd me some electric experiments.They were imperfectly perform'd, as he was not very expert; but, being ona subject quite new to me, they equally surpris'd and pleased me.Soon after my return to Philadelphia, our library company receiv'dfrom Mr. P. Collinson, Fellow of the Royal Society of London,a present of a glass tube, with some account of the use of itin making such experiments.  I eagerly seized the opportunityof repeating what I had seen at Boston; and, by much practice,acquir'd great readiness in performing those, also, which we hadan account of from England, adding a number of new ones.  I saymuch practice, for my house was continually full, for some time,with people who came to see these new wonders.To divide a little this incumbrance among my friends, I causeda number of similar tubes to be blown at our glass-house,with which they furnish'd themselves, so that we had at lengthseveral performers.  Among these, the principal was Mr. Kinnersley,an ingenious neighbor, who, being out of business, I encouragedto undertake showing the experiments for money, and drew up for himtwo lectures, in which the experiments were rang'd in such order,and accompanied with such explanations in such method, as thatthe foregoing should assist in comprehending the following.He procur'd an elegant apparatus for the purpose, in which allthe little machines that I had roughly made for myself were nicelyform'd by instrument-makers. His lectures were well attended,and gave great satisfaction; and after some time he went thro'the colonies, exhibiting them in every capital town, and pick'd upsome money.  In the West India islands, indeed, it was with difficultythe experiments could be made, from the general moisture of the air.Oblig'd as we were to Mr. Collinson for his present of the tube, etc., Ithought it right he should be inform'd of our success in using it,and wrote him several letters containing accounts of our experiments.He got them read in the Royal Society, where they were not at firstthought worth so much notice as to be printed in their Transactions.One paper, which I wrote for Mr. Kinnersley, on the sameness oflightning with electricity, I sent to Dr. Mitchel, an acquaintanceof mine, and one of the members also of that society, who wrote meword that it had been read, but was laughed at by the connoisseurs.The papers, however, being shown to Dr. Fothergill, he thought themof too much value to be stifled, and advis'd the printing of them.Mr. Collinson then gave them to Cave for publication in hisGentleman's Magazine; but he chose to print them separately ina pamphlet, and Dr. Fothergill wrote the preface.  Cave, it seems,judged rightly for his profit, for by the additions that arrivedafterward they swell'd to a quarto volume, which has had five editions,and cost him nothing for copy-money.It was, however, some time before those papers were much taken noticeof in England.  A copy of them happening to fall into the handsof the Count de Buffon, a philosopher deservedly of great reputationin France, and, indeed, all over Europe, he prevailed with M. Dalibardto translate them into French, and they were printed at Paris.The publication offended the Abbe Nollet, preceptor in Natural Philosophyto the royal family, and an able experimenter, who had form'd andpublish'd a theory of electricity, which then had the general vogue.He could not at first believe that such a work came from America,and said it must have been fabricated by his enemies at Paris, to decryhis system.  Afterwards, having been assur'd that there really existedsuch a person as 
ESFJ	 at Philadelphia, which he had doubted,he wrote and published a volume of Letters, chiefly address'd to me,defending his theory, and denying the verity of my experiments,and of the positions deduc'd from them.I once purpos'd answering the abbe, and actually began the answer;but, on consideration that my writings contain'd a descriptionof experiments which any one might repeat and verify, and if notto be verifi'd, could not be defended; or of observations offer'das conjectures, and not delivered dogmatically, therefore notlaying me under any obligation to defend them; and reflectingthat a dispute between two persons, writing in different languages,might be lengthened greatly by mistranslations, and thencemisconceptions of one another's meaning, much of one of the abbe'sletters being founded on an error in the translation, I concludedto let my papers shift for themselves, believing it was betterto spend what time I could spare from public business in makingnew experiments, than in disputing about those already made.I therefore never answered M. Nollet, and the event gave me nocause to repent my silence; for my friend M. le Roy, of the RoyalAcademy of Sciences, took up my cause and refuted him; my bookwas translated into the Italian, German, and Latin languages;and the doctrine it contain'd was by degrees universally adoptedby the philosophers of Europe, in preference to that of the abbe;so that he lived to see himself the last of his sect, except MonsieurB----, of Paris, his eleve and immediate disciple.What gave my book the more sudden and general celebrity,was the success of one of its proposed experiments, made by Messrs.Dalibard and De Lor at Marly, for drawing lightning from the clouds.This engag'd the public attention every where.  M. de Lor,who had an apparatus for experimental philosophy, and lectur'din that branch of science, undertook to repeat what he calledthe Philadelphia Experiments; and, after they were performed beforethe king and court, all the curious of Paris flocked to see them.I will not swell this narrative with an account of that capitalexperiment, nor of the infinite pleasure I receiv'd in the successof a similar one I made soon after with a kite at Philadelphia,as both are to be found in the histories of electricity.Dr. Wright, an English physician, when at Paris, wrote to a friend,who was of the Royal Society, an account of the high esteem myexperiments were in among the learned abroad, and of their wonderthat my writings had been so little noticed in England.  The society,on this, resum'd the consideration of the letters that had been readto them; and the celebrated Dr. Watson drew up a summary accountof them, and of all I had afterwards sent to England on the subject,which be accompanied with some praise of the writer.  This summarywas then printed in their Transactions; and some members of the societyin London, particularly the very ingenious Mr. Canton, having verifiedthe experiment of procuring lightning from the clouds by a pointed rod,and acquainting them with the success, they soon made me more thanamends for the slight with which they had before treated me.Without my having made any application for that honor, they chose mea member, and voted that I should be excus'd the customary payments,which would have amounted to twenty-five guineas; and ever sincehave given me their Transactions gratis.  They also presentedme with the gold medal of Sir Godfrey Copley for the year 1753,the delivery of which was accompanied by a very handsome speechof the president, Lord Macclesfield, wherein I was highly honoured.Our new governor, Captain Denny, brought over for me the before-mentionedmedal from the Royal Society, which he presented to me at anentertainment given him by the city.  He accompanied it with verypolite expressions of his esteem for me, having, as he said, been longacquainted with my character.  After dinner, when the company,as was customary at that time, were engag'd in drinking, he tookme aside into another room, and acquainted me that he had beenadvis'd by his friends in England to cultivate a friendship with me,as one who was capable of giving him the best advice, and ofcontributing most effectually to the making his administration easy;that he therefore desired of all things to have a good understandingwith me, and he begg'd me to be assur'd of his readiness on alloccasions to render me every service that might be in his power.He said much to me, also, of the proprietor's good dispositiontowards the province, and of the advantage it might be to us all,and to me in particular, if the opposition that had been so longcontinu'd to his measures was dropt, and harmony restor'd betweenhim and the people; in effecting which, it was thought no one couldbe more serviceable than myself; and I might depend on adequateacknowledgments and recompenses, etc., etc.  The drinkers,finding we did not return immediately to the table, sent usa decanter of Madeira, which the governor made liberal use of,and in proportion became more profuse of his solicitations and promises.My answers were to this purpose:  that my circumstances, thanks to God,were such as to make proprietary favours unnecessary to me;and that, being a member of the Assembly, I could not possibly acceptof any; that, however, I had no personal enmity to the proprietary,and that, whenever the public measures he propos'd should appearto be for the good of the people, no one should espouse and forwardthem more zealously than myself; my past opposition having beenfounded on this, that the measures which had been urged were evidentlyintended to serve the proprietary interest, with great prejudiceto that of the people; that I was much obliged to him (the governor)for his professions of regard to me, and that he might rely on everything in my power to make his administration as easy as possible,hoping at the same time that he had not brought with him the sameunfortunate instruction his predecessor had been hamper'd with.On this he did not then explain himself; but when he afterwards cameto do business with the Assembly, they appear'd again, the disputeswere renewed, and I was as active as ever in the opposition,being the penman, first, of the request to have a communicationof the instructions, and then of the remarks upon them, which maybe found in the votes of the time, and in the Historical Review Iafterward publish'd. But between us personally no enmity arose;we were often together; he was a man of letters, had seen much ofthe world, and was very entertaining and pleasing in conversation.He gave me the first information that my old friend Jas.  Ralph wasstill alive; that he was esteem'd one of the best political writersin England; had been employ'd in the dispute between Prince Fredericand the king, and had obtain'd a pension of three hundred a year;that his reputation was indeed small as a poet, Pope having damnedhis poetry in the Dunciad; but his prose was thought as good as anyman's.<15>The Assembly finally finding the proprietary obstinately persistedin manacling their deputies with instructions inconsistent not onlywith the privileges of the people, but with the service of the crown,resolv'd to petition the king against them, and appointed me theiragent to go over to England, to present and support the petition.The House had sent up a bill to the governor, granting a sumof sixty thousand pounds for the king's use (ten thousand poundsof which was subjected to the orders of the then general,Lord Loudoun), which the governor absolutely refus'd to pass,in compliance with his instructions.     <15> The many unanimous resolves of the Assembly--          what date?-- [Marg. note.]I had agreed with Captain Morris, of the paquet at New York,for my passage, and my stores were put on board, when Lord Loudounarriv'd at Philadelphia, expressly, as he told me, to endeavoran accommodation between the governor and Assembly, that hismajesty's service might not be obstructed by their dissensions.Accordingly, he desir'd the governor and myself to meet him, that hemight hear what was to be said on both sides.  We met and discuss'dthe business.  In behalf of the Assembly, I urg'd all the variousarguments that may be found in the public papers of that time,which were of my writing, and are printed with the minutes ofthe Assembly; and the governor pleaded his instructions; the bond hehad given to observe them, and his ruin if he disobey'd, yet seemednot unwilling to hazard himself if Lord Loudoun would advise it.This his lordship did not chuse to do, though I once thought Ihad nearly prevail'd with him to do it; but finally he rather choseto urge the compliance of the Assembly; and he entreated me to usemy endeavours with them for that purpose, declaring that he wouldspare none of the king's troops for the defense of our frontiers,and that, if we did not continue to provide for that defense ourselves,they must remain expos'd to the enemy.I acquainted the House with what had pass'd, and, presenting themwith a set of resolutions I had drawn up, declaring our rights,and that we did not relinquish our claim to those rights, but onlysuspended the exercise of them on this occasion thro' force,against which we protested, they at length agreed to drop that bill,and frame another conformable to the proprietary instructions.This of course the governor pass'd, and I was then at libertyto proceed on my voyage.  But, in the meantime, the paquethad sailed with my sea-stores, which was some loss to me,and my only recompense was his lordship's thanks for my service,all the credit of obtaining the accommodation falling to his share.He set out for New York before me; and, as the time for dispatchingthe paquet-boats was at his disposition, and there were two thenremaining there, one of which, he said, was to sail very soon,I requested to know the precise time, that I might not miss herby any delay of mine.  His answer was, 'I have given out that sheis to sail on Saturday next; but I may let you know, entre nous,that if you are there by Monday morning, you will be in time,but do not delay longer.'  By some accidental hinderance at a ferry,it was Monday noon before I arrived, and I was much afraidshe might have sailed, as the wind was fair; but I was soonmade easy by the information that she was still in the harbor,and would not move till the next day.  One would imagine that Iwas now on the very point of departing for Europe.  I thought so;but I was not then so well acquainted with his lordship's character,of which indecision was one of the strongest features.  I shallgive some instances.  It was about the beginning of April that Icame to New York, and I think it was near the end of June beforewe sail'd. There were then two of the paquet-boats, which hadbeen long in port, but were detained for the general's letters,which were always to be ready to-morrow. Another paquet arriv'd;she too was detain'd; and, before we sail'd, a fourth was expected.Ours was the first to be dispatch'd, as having been there longest.Passengers were engag'd in all, and some extremely impatientto be gone, and the merchants uneasy about their letters,and the orders they had given for insurance (it being war time)for fall goods! but their anxiety avail'd nothing; his lordship'sletters were not ready; and yet whoever waited on him found himalways at his desk, pen in hand, and concluded he must needswrite abundantly.Going myself one morning to pay my respects, I found in his antechamberone Innis, a messenger of Philadelphia, who had come from thenceexpress with a paquet from Governor Denny for the General.He delivered to me some letters from my friends there, which occasion'dmy inquiring when he was to return, and where be lodg'd, that Imight send some letters by him.  He told me he was order'd to callto-morrow at nine for the general's answer to the governor, and shouldset off immediately.  I put my letters into his hands the same day.A fortnight after I met him again in the same place.  'So, youare soon return'd, Innis?'  'Returned! no, I am not gone yet.''How so?'  'I have called here by order every morning these twoweeks past for his lordship's letter, and it is not yet ready.''Is it possible, when he is so great a writer? for I see himconstantly at his escritoire.'  'Yes,' says Innis, 'but he is likeSt. George on the signs, always on horseback, and never rides on!'This observation of the messenger was, it seems, well founded; for,when in England, I understood that Mr. Pitt gave it as one reasonfor removing this general, and sending Generals Amherst and Wolfe,that the minister never heard from him, and could not know what hewas doing.This daily expectation of sailing, and all the three paquets goingdown to Sandy Hook, to join the fleet there, the passengers thoughtit best to be on board, lest by a sudden order the ships should sail,and they be left behind.  There, if I remember right, we were aboutsix weeks, consuming our sea-stores, and oblig'd to procure more.At length the fleet sail'd, the General and all his army on board,bound to Louisburg, with intent to besiege and take that fortress;all the paquet-boats in company ordered to attend the General's ship,ready to receive his dispatches when they should be ready.We were out five days before we got a letter with leave to part,and then our ship quitted the fleet and steered for England.  The othertwo paquets he still detained, carried them with him to Halifax,where he stayed some time to exercise the men in sham attacksupon sham forts, then alter'd his mind as to besieging Louisburg,and return'd to New York, with all his troops, together with the twopaquets above mentioned, and all their passengers!  During hisabsence the French and savages had taken Fort George, on the frontierof that province, and the savages had massacred many of the garrisonafter capitulation.I saw afterwards in London Captain Bonnell, who commanded oneof those paquets.  He told me that, when he had been detain'da month, he acquainted his lordship that his ship was grown foul,to a degree that must necessarily hinder her fast sailing, a pointof consequence for a paquet-boat, and requested an allowanceof time to heave her down and clean her bottom.  He was askedhow long time that would require.  He answer'd, three days.The general replied, 'If you can do it in one day, I give leave;otherwise not; for you must certainly sail the day after to-morrow.'So he never obtain'd leave, though detained afterwards from dayto day during full three months.I saw also in London one of Bonnell's passengers, who was so enrag'dagainst his lordship for deceiving and detaining him so longat New York, and then carrying him to Halifax and back again,that he swore he would sue for damages.  Whether he did or not,I never heard; but, as he represented the injury to his affairs,it was very considerable.On the whole, I wonder'd much how such a man came to be intrustedwith so important a business as the conduct of a great army;but, having since seen more of the great world, and the meansof obtaining, and motives for giving places, my wonder is diminished.General Shirley, on whom the command of the army devolved uponthe death of Braddock, would, in my opinion, if continued in place,have made a much better campaign than that of Loudoun in 1757,which was frivolous, expensive, and disgraceful to our nationbeyond conception; for, tho' Shirley was not a bred soldier, he wassensible and sagacious in himself, and attentive to good advicefrom others, capable of forming judicious plans, and quick and activein carrying them into execution.  Loudoun, instead of defendingthe colonies with his great army, left them totally expos'd whilehe paraded idly at Halifax, by which means Fort George was lost,besides, he derang'd all our mercantile operations, and distress'dour trade, by a long embargo on the exportation of provisions,on pretence of keeping supplies from being obtain'd by the enemy,but in reality for beating down their price in favor of the contractors,in whose profits, it was said, perhaps from suspicion only, he hada share.  And, when at length the embargo was taken off, by neglectingto send notice of it to Charlestown, the Carolina fleet was detain'dnear three months longer, whereby their bottoms were so much damagedby the worm that a great part of them foundered in their passage home.Shirley was, I believe, sincerely glad of being relieved fromso burdensome a charge as the conduct of an army must be to a manunacquainted with military business.  I was at the entertainmentgiven by the city of New York to Lord Loudoun, on his taking upon himthe command.  Shirley, tho' thereby superseded, was present also.There was a great company of officers, citizens, and strangers, and,some chairs having been borrowed in the neighborhood, there was one amongthem very low, which fell to the lot of Mr. Shirley.  Perceiving itas I sat by him, I said, 'They have given you, sir, too low a seat.''No matter,' says he, 'Mr. 
ESFJ	, I find a low seat the easiest.'While I was, as afore mention'd, detain'd at New York, I receiv'dall the accounts of the provisions, etc., that I had furnish'dto Braddock, some of which accounts could not sooner be obtain'dfrom the different persons I had employ'd to assist in the business.I presented them to Lord Loudoun, desiring to be paid the ballance.He caus'd them to be regularly examined by the proper officer, who,after comparing every article with its voucher, certified themto be right; and the balance due for which his lordship promis'dto give me an order on the paymaster.  This was, however, put offfrom time to time; and, tho' I call'd often for it by appointment,I did not get it.  At length, just before my departure, he told mehe had, on better consideration, concluded not to mix his accountswith those of his predecessors.  'And you,' says he, 'when in England,have only to exhibit your accounts at the treasury, and you will bepaid immediately.'I mention'd, but without effect, the great and unexpected expense Ihad been put to by being detain'd so long at New York, as a reasonfor my desiring to be presently paid; and on my observing that it wasnot right I should be put to any further trouble or delay in obtainingthe money I had advanc'd, as I charged no commission for my service,'O, sir,' says he, 'you must not think of persuading us that you areno gainer; we understand better those affairs, and know that everyone concerned in supplying the army finds means, in the doing it,to fill his own pockets.'  I assur'd him that was not my case,and that I had not pocketed a farthing; but he appear'd clearlynot to believe me; and, indeed, I have since learnt that immensefortunes are often made in such employments.  As to my ballance,I am not paid it to this day, of which more hereafter.Our captain of the paquet had boasted much, before we sailed,of the swiftness of his ship; unfortunately, when we came to sea,she proved the dullest of ninety-six sail, to his no small mortification.After many conjectures respecting the cause, when we were nearanother ship almost as dull as ours, which, however, gain'd upon us,the captain ordered all hands to come aft, and stand as near the ensignstaff as possible.  We were, passengers included, about forty persons.While we stood there, the ship mended her pace, and soon left herneighbour far behind, which prov'd clearly what our captain suspected,that she was loaded too much by the head.  The casks of water,it seems, had been all plac'd forward; these he therefore order'dto be mov'd further aft, on which the ship recover'd her character,and proved the sailer in the fleet.The captain said she had once gone at the rate of thirteen knots,which is accounted thirteen miles per hour.  We had on board,as a passenger, Captain Kennedy, of the Navy, who contended that itwas impossible, and that no ship ever sailed so fast, and thatthere must have been some error in the division of the log-line,or some mistake in heaving the log.  A wager ensu'd between thetwo captains, to be decided when there should be sufficient wind.Kennedy thereupon examin'd rigorously the log-line, and,being satisfi'd with that, he determin'd to throw the log himself.Accordingly some days after, when the wind blew very fair and fresh,and the captain of the paquet, Lutwidge, said he believ'd she thenwent at the rate of thirteen knots, Kennedy made the experiment,and own'd his wager lost.The above fact I give for the sake of the following observation.It has been remark'd, as an imperfection in the art of ship-building,that it can never be known, till she is tried, whether a new ship willor will not be a good sailer; for that the model of a good-sailingship has been exactly follow'd in a new one, which has prov'd, onthe contrary, remarkably dull.  I apprehend that this may partly beoccasion'd by the different opinions of seamen respecting the modesof lading, rigging, and sailing of a ship; each has his system;and the same vessel, laden by the judgment and orders of one captain,shall sail better or worse than when by the orders of another.Besides, it scarce ever happens that a ship is form'd, fitted forthe sea, and sail'd by the same person.  One man builds the hull,another rigs her, a third lades and sails her.  No one of these hasthe advantage of knowing all the ideas and experience of the others,and, therefore, can not draw just conclusions from a combinationof the whole.Even in the simple operation of sailing when at sea, I haveoften observ'd different judgments in the officers who commandedthe successive watches, the wind being the same.  One would havethe sails trimm'd sharper or flatter than another, so that theyseem'd to have no certain rule to govern by.  Yet I think a setof experiments might be instituted, first, to determine the mostproper form of the hull for swift sailing; next, the best dimensionsand properest place for the masts:  then the form and quantityof sails, and their position, as the wind may be; and, lastly,the disposition of the lading.  This is an age of experiments,and I think a set accurately made and combin'd would be of great use.I am persuaded, therefore, that ere long some ingenious philosopherwill undertake it, to whom I wish success.We were several times chas'd in our passage, but outsail'd every thing,and in thirty days had soundings.  We had a good observation,and the captain judg'd himself so near our port, Falmouth, that,if we made a good run in the night, we might be off the mouthof that harbor in the morning, and by running in the night mightescape the notice of the enemy's privateers, who often crus'd nearthe entrance of the channel.  Accordingly, all the sail was setthat we could possibly make, and the wind being very fresh and fair,we went right before it, and made great way.  The captain,after his observation, shap'd his course, as he thought, so as topass wide of the Scilly Isles; but it seems there is sometimesa strong indraught setting up St. George's Channel, which deceivesseamen and caused the loss of Sir Cloudesley Shovel's squadron.This indraught was probably the cause of what happened to us.We had a watchman plac'd in the bow, to whom they often called,'Look well out before there,' and he as often answered, 'Ay ay;' but perhaps had his eyes shut, and was half asleep at the time,they sometimes answering, as is said, mechanically; for he did notsee a light just before us, which had been hid by the studdingsailsfrom the man at the helm, and from the rest of the watch,but by an accidental yaw of the ship was discover'd, and occasion'da great alarm, we being very near it, the light appearingto me as big as a cart-wheel. It was midnight, and our captainfast asleep; but Captain Kennedy, jumping upon deck, and seeingthe danger, ordered the ship to wear round, all sails standing;an operation dangerous to the masts, but it carried us clear,and we escaped shipwreck, for we were running right upon the rockson which the light-house was erected.  This deliverance impressedme strongly with the utility of light-houses, and made me resolveto encourage the building more of them in America, if I should liveto return there.In the morning it was found by the soundings, etc., that we were nearour port, but a thick fog hid the land from our sight.  About nineo'clock the fog began to rise, and seem'd to be lifted up fromthe water like the curtain at a play-house, discovering underneath,the town of Falmouth, the vessels in its harbor, and the fieldsthat surrounded it.  This was a most pleasing spectacle to thosewho had been so long without any other prospects than the uniformview of a vacant ocean, and it gave us the more pleasure as wewere now free from the anxieties which the state of war occasion'd.I set out immediately, with my son, for London, and we only stopta little by the way to view Stonehenge on Salisbury Plain, and LordPembroke's house and gardens, with his very curious antiquitiesat Wilton.  We arrived in London the 27th of July, 1757.<16>     <16> Here terminates the Autobiography, as published by          Wm. Temple 
ESFJ	 and his successors.  What follows          was written in the last year of Dr. 
ESFJ	's life,          and was first printed (in English) in Mr. Bigelow's          edition of 1868.--ED.AS SOON as I was settled in a lodging Mr. Charles had provided for me,I went to visit Dr. Fothergill, to whom I was strongly recommended,and whose counsel respecting my proceedings I was advis'd to obtain.He was against an immediate complaint to government, and thoughtthe proprietaries should first be personally appli'd to, who mightpossibly be induc'd by the interposition and persuasion of someprivate friends, to accommodate matters amicably.  I then waitedon my old friend and correspondent, Mr. Peter Collinson, who toldme that John Hanbury, the great Virginia merchant, had requestedto be informed when I should arrive, that he might carry me to LordGranville's, who was then President of the Council and wished to seeme as soon as possible.  I agreed to go with him the next morning.Accordingly Mr. Hanbury called for me and took me in his carriageto that nobleman's, who receiv'd me with great civility; and aftersome questions respecting the present state of affairs in Americaand discourse thereupon, he said to me:  'You Americans have wrongideas of the nature of your constitution; you contend that the king'sinstructions to his governors are not laws, and think yourselvesat liberty to regard or disregard them at your own discretion.But those instructions are not like the pocket instructions givento a minister going abroad, for regulating his conduct in sometrifling point of ceremony.  They are first drawn up by judgeslearned in the laws; they are then considered, debated, and perhapsamended in Council, after which they are signed by the king.They are then, so far as they relate to you, the law of the land,for the king is the LEGISLATOR OF THE COLONIES.'  I told hislordship this was new doctrine to me.  I had always understoodfrom our charters that our laws were to be made by our Assemblies,to be presented indeed to the king for his royal assent,but that being once given the king could not repeal or alter them.And as the Assemblies could not make permanent laws withouthis assent, so neither could he make a law for them without theirs.He assur'd me I was totally mistaken.  I did not think so, however,and his lordship's conversation having a little alarm'd me as towhat might be the sentiments of the court concerning us, I wroteit down as soon as I return'd to my lodgings.  I recollected thatabout 20 years before, a clause in a bill brought into Parliamentby the ministry had propos'd to make the king's instructions lawsin the colonies, but the clause was thrown out by the Commons,for which we adored them as our friends and friends of liberty,till by their conduct towards us in 1765 it seem'd that they hadrefus'd that point of sovereignty to the king only that they mightreserve it for themselves.After some days, Dr. Fothergill having spoken to the proprietaries,they agreed to a meeting with me at Mr. T. Penn's house in Spring Garden.The conversation at first consisted of mutual declarationsof disposition to reasonable accommodations, but I suppose eachparty had its own ideas of what should be meant by reasonable.We then went into consideration of our several points of complaint,which I enumerated.  The proprietaries justify'd their conductas well as they could, and I the Assembly's. We now appearedvery wide, and so far from each other in our opinions as todiscourage all hope of agreement.  However, it was concludedthat I should give them the heads of our complaints in writing,and they promis'd then to consider them.  I did so soon after,but they put the paper into the hands of their solicitor,Ferdinand John Paris, who managed for them all their law businessin their great suit with the neighbouring proprietary of Maryland,Lord Baltimore, which had subsisted 70 years, and wrote for themall their papers and messages in their dispute with the Assembly.He was a proud, angry man, and as I had occasionally in the answersof the Assembly treated his papers with some severity, they beingreally weak in point of argument and haughty in expression,he had conceived a mortal enmity to me, which discovering itselfwhenever we met, I declin'd the proprietary's proposal that heand I should discuss the heads of complaint between our two selves,and refus'd treating with any one but them.  They then by his adviceput the paper into the hands of the Attorney and Solicitor-Generalfor their opinion and counsel upon it, where it lay unanswereda year wanting eight days, during which time I made frequent demandsof an answer from the proprietaries, but without obtaining any otherthan that they had not yet received the opinion of the Attorneyand Solicitor-General.  What it was when they did receive it Inever learnt, for they did not communicate it to me, but sent a longmessage to the Assembly drawn and signed by Paris, reciting my paper,complaining of its want of formality, as a rudeness on my part,and giving a flimsy justification of their conduct, adding that theyshould be willing to accommodate matters if the Assembly would sendout some person of candour to treat with them for that purpose,intimating thereby that I was not such.The want of formality or rudeness was, probably, my not havingaddress'd the paper to them with their assum'd titles of Trueand Absolute Proprietaries of the Province of Pennsylvania,which I omitted as not thinking it necessary in a paper,the intention of which was only to reduce to a certainty by writing,what in conversation I had delivered viva voce.But during this delay, the Assembly having prevailed with Gov'rDenny to pass an act taxing the proprietary estate in common withthe estates of the people, which was the grand point in dispute,they omitted answering the message.When this act however came over, the proprietaries, counselledby Paris, determined to oppose its receiving the royal assent.Accordingly they petition'd the king in Council, and a hearing wasappointed in which two lawyers were employ'd by them against the act,and two by me in support of it.  They alledg'd that the act wasintended to load the proprietary estate in order to spare thoseof the people, and that if it were suffer'd to continue in force,and the proprietaries who were in odium with the people, left to theirmercy in proportioning the taxes, they would inevitably be ruined.We reply'd that the act had no such intention, and would have nosuch effect.  That the assessors were honest and discreet men underan oath to assess fairly and equitably, and that any advantage eachof them might expect in lessening his own tax by augmenting that ofthe proprietaries was too trifling to induce them to perjure themselves.This is the purport of what I remember as urged by both sides,except that we insisted strongly on the mischievous consequencesthat must attend a repeal, for that the money, L100,000, being printedand given to the king's use, expended in his service, and now spreadamong the people, the repeal would strike it dead in their handsto the ruin of many, and the total discouragement of future grants,and the selfishness of the proprietors in soliciting such ageneral catastrophe, merely from a groundless fear of their estatebeing taxed too highly, was insisted on in the strongest terms.On this, Lord Mansfield, one of the counsel rose, and beckoning metook me into the clerk's chamber, while the lawyers were pleading,and asked me if I was really of opinion that no injury would be donethe proprietary estate in the execution of the act.  I said certainly.'Then,' says he, 'you can have little objection to enter intoan engagement to assure that point.'  I answer'd, 'None at all.'He then call'd in Paris, and after some discourse, his lordship'sproposition was accepted on both sides; a paper to the purpose wasdrawn up by the Clerk of the Council, which I sign'd with Mr. Charles,who was also an Agent of the Province for their ordinary affairs,when Lord Mansfield returned to the Council Chamber, where finallythe law was allowed to pass.  Some changes were however recommendedand we also engaged they should be made by a subsequent law,but the Assembly did not think them necessary; for one year's taxhaving been levied by the act before the order of Council arrived,they appointed a committee to examine the proceedings of the assessors,and on this committee they put several particular friends ofthe proprietaries.  After a full enquiry, they unanimously sign'da report that they found the tax had been assess'd with perfect equity.The Assembly looked into my entering into the first part ofthe engagement, as an essential service to the Province, since itsecured the credit of the paper money then spread over all the country.They gave me their thanks in form when I return'd. But the proprietarieswere enraged at Governor Denny for having pass'd the act, and turn'dhim out with threats of suing him for breach of instructionswhich he had given bond to observe.  He, however, having done itat the instance of the General, and for His Majesty's service,and having some powerful interest at court, despis'd the threatsand they were never put in execution.  . . .
ESTJ	Ernest Miller 
ESTJ	 was born into an afflu-ent family in the Chicago suburb of Oak Park, Illi-nois, on July 21, 1899, the eldest of six children. Hisfather,  Clarence  Edmond,  was  a  physician.  Hismother, the former Grace Hall, kept an attractivehouse at 439 North Oak Park Avenue, her father’sdwelling, into which her husband moved and liveduntil her father’s death in 1905. Grace exposed herson Ernest to the arts by taking him to museums inChicago  and  by  enrolling  him  in  piano  lessons.
ESTJ	, as both son and writer, frequently re-belled against her puritanical values.As  a  student  at  Oak  Park  High  School,  fromwhich 
ESTJ	 graduated in 1917, he contrib-uted to the school newspaper and other publica-tions. Upon graduation, he realized that he wouldsoon be in some way drawn into World War I. Hisfirst job, as a reporter for theKansas City Star, wascut short when, after being rejected for militaryservice because of weak eyesight, he enlisted as anambulance driver for the Red Cross early in 1918and was sent to Italy.On July 8, 1918, 
ESTJ	, who served withsome heroism, was wounded by mortar fire at Fos-salta di Piave. He was hospitalized for an extendedperiod, and when he returned to the United States,the dashing, dark-haired 
ESTJ	 was consid-ered a conquering hero and was in great demandto speak before civic groups about his war experi-ence. He was lionized for his heroism.After recuperating at his family’s summer homein  Michigan,  
ESTJ	  became  a  reporter  fortheToronto StarandStar Weekly, which sent him toEurope as a foreign correspondent in 1921, shortlyafter his marriage to Hadley Richardson. The twosettled in Paris, where they met many of the fore-most contributors to Europe’s avant-garde artisticscene. Among his Parisian associates 
ESTJ	numbered  Sherwood  Anderson,  Ford  MadoxFord, James Joyce, Ezra Pound, and, perhaps mostsignificant, Gertrude Stein. It was from Stein thathe learned the elements of literary style that werelater to affect his writing most directly.
ESTJ	 began to write short stories and, in1923, publishedThree Stories and Ten Poemsin Paris,followed the next year byIn Our Time, a collectionof short stories, which was republished in 1925 inthe United States. By then, 
ESTJ	 was begin-ning  to  move  away  from  reporting  and  full-timeinto his career.In 1926, he publishedThe Torrents of Springandhis  renowned  novel  of  the  so-called  lost  genera-tion,The Sun Also Rises, with Charles Scribner’s Sonsin  New  York,  which  remained  his  publisher  forall but one of his later books.The Sun Also Riseses-tablished 
ESTJ	’s early reputation, althoughreal commercial success evaded him for anothertwo years untilA Farewell to Armsappeared in 1929.Both books showcase his strength: writing aboutmen who responded to adversity in a way that he1068© The Nobel Foundationdefined as courageous. For 
ESTJ	, couragewas showing grace under pressure.Men Without Womenappeared in 1927, the yearin which 
ESTJ	 divorced Hadley and marriedPauline Pfeiffer. In 1928, 
ESTJ	 decided toreturn to the United States. He and Pauline usedtheir house in Key West, Florida, as their base until1939, although their stays there were interruptedby frequent travel, particularly from 1936 to 1938,when 
ESTJ	 went to Spain to cover the Span-ish Civil War for the North American NewspaperAlliance.The  Key  West  years  were  productive  ones  for
ESTJ	. He was happy there and began his ex-tensive adventures as a sport fisherman in the Gulfof Mexico. These were much more elaborate ex-cursions than his cherished childhood fishing andhunting trips with his father in northern Michigan.At about this time, 
ESTJ	, who had experi-enced the running of the bulls at Pamplona, beganto develop his lifelong interest in bullfighting. Hisbook  on  the  subject,Death  in  the  Afternoon,  ap-peared  in  1932,  his  first  to  depart  from  the  wartheme that had come for many to define his writ-ing.  His  major  concern  therein,  however,  is  stillgrace under pressure.Ever seeking new adventures, 
ESTJ	 tookhis first African safari in 1933-1934; during thesetravels he also revisited Spain and France. HisGreenHills of Africa, published in 1935, resulted from this,his first of many African ventures. Back in Key Westafter the Spanish Civil War ended in 1938, Heming-way was restless, and in 1939, he bought a house,called  Finca  Vigia,  outside  Havana,  Cuba,  andmoved there.
ESTJ	’s obsession with adventure and withproving  his  masculinity—clear  motivations  formany of his more daring adventures—made himdifficult to live with; in 1940, Pauline divorced him.In the same year,For Whom the Bell Tollswas pub-lished, and 
ESTJ	 married newswoman Mar-tha Gellhorn, several years his senior, whom he re-garded  subconsciously  as  a  mother  figure,  as  hemay have done all his wives. His resentment of hisown mother is often said to have manifested itselfin his marriages, directed against the women hechose to marry.With the entry of the United States into WorldWar II, 
ESTJ	 again went to Europe as a warcorrespondent. He participated in the Allied Nor-mandy invasion, hatched a personal scheme to lib-erate Paris, and attached himself to the Fourth In-fantry  Division,  somewhat  against  the  will  of  itsofficers. When 
ESTJ	 returned to Cuba dur-ing the war, he became a self-appointed antisubma-rine operative, sailing into the ocean on his yachtto spot enemy submarines and disable any he en-countered.The U.S. government was embarrassed by Hem-ingway’s unsolicited help. His literary productiondeclined during this period, and his drinking wasout of control. When Martha Gellhorn divorcedhim in 1944, he quickly married Mary Welsh, whowould remain his wife until 
ESTJ	, seekingthe same solution to his problems that his fatherhad earlier, committed suicide in 1961.
ESTJ	’s artistic end seemed imminent in1950 when his novelAcross the River and into the Treeswas poorly received by critics and the public alike;however, he rallied from that defeat and, in 1952,published one of his most popular works, the no-vellaThe Old Man and the Sea. About a year after thebook was published, 
ESTJ	 survived two air-plane crashes in Africa. Reported dead, he eventu-ally charged out of the bush with a bottle of whiskeyin his hand. In 1954, he was awarded the NobelPrize  in  Literature  but,  because  of  his  injuries,could not attend the awards ceremony. His Nobelcitation, even though the prize is for the full bodyof his literary work, specifically citedThe Old Manand the Seaas exemplifying that which the awardseeks to honor in literature.When Cuba fell to Fidel Castro in 1959, Hem-ingway  bought  his  final  residence,  a  house  inKetchum,  Idaho.  He  moved  there  in  1959,  thesame year in which he began treatments for depres-sion and various physical ills at the Mayo Clinic inRochester, Minnesota. His despondence over hisdeclining health and over his inability to write aswell as he once had led him to end his life on July 2,1961, by putting a twelve-gauge shotgun into hismouth and pulling the trigger.AnalysisDuring 
ESTJ	’s formative years, his mothertried to civilize her son. His father, when he couldtake time away from his medical practice to be withhis family at its summer home near Petosky, Michi-gan, exposed 
ESTJ	 to such sporting activi-ties as hunting, fishing, and living in the woods.Ernest 
ESTJ	1069
ESTJ	, never a large man, endured an adoles-cence of viewing the world from the perspective ofsomeone five feet, four inches tall. This early per-spective eventually made itself felt in his work.Beginning to write long before the graphic artshad coined the term “minimalist,” 
ESTJ	 wasan early minimalist in his writing. He learned partof the minimalist lesson during his years as a news-paper reporter. He learned, also, during that pe-riod the importance of close, accurate observation.As anyone who has studied journalism knows, jour-nalistic writing is direct, unencumbered, and ac-cessible. Journalists write short sentences that theyincorporate into short paragraphs. Their vocabu-lary is simple, their syntax not obscure.During his apprenticeship as a writer, Heming-way was a journalist—but not merely a journalist.He was a journalist living in post-World War I Paris,certainly the preferred gathering place of avant-garde artists and intellectuals of that age. Besidesliving  at  the  geographical  center  of  European—and therefore, worldwide—intellectual and artisticferment, 
ESTJ	 was a part of an inner circleof challenging artists.Ezra  Pound,  newly  emerged  from  his  Imagistand vorticist stages in poetry, was working on hisCantos,  which  he  began  to  publish  in  1930  andpublished periodically for the following ten years.Pound was also encouraging and guiding the youngT. S. Eliot, who dwelt just across the English Chan-nel in London, as he wroteThe Waste Land(1922),the poem that came to define modernism in po-etry. Ford Madox Ford was turning his efforts to re-cording in novels and short stories much of whathe had experienced in the war. Sherwood Ander-son,  goaded  by  Gertrude  Stein,  was  discoveringmetaphors for the whole of human existence in hisclose  examination  of  lives  of  the  people  whosehouses  fronted  on  the  main  street  of  his  nativeWinesburg, Ohio.Around Stein grew a circle of artists bent on re-defining art as it was then known. Pablo Picassohad passed from expressionism to impressionismand was emerging as a cubist, accomplishing withpaint  what  others  would  come  to  work  towardachieving with words. Henri Matisse was rediscov-ering color and using it in ways and in forms thatalarmed the public and set an aesthetic revolutiongoing in the minds of artists. Fortunately for Hem-ingway, he soon became a favored guest at 27 ruedes Fleures, where the redoubtable Stein lived withAlice B. Toklas, her companion, who talked withthe wives while Stein picked the brains of their cre-ative husbands. Such was the intellectual milieu inwhich  
ESTJ	  found  himself  as  a  youth  notquite twenty-five. He was a reporter, and the pres-sure of that job assured his fluency in writing. Thewriting he did on his own was less voluminous thanthe writing he was paid to do.
ESTJ	 set for himself the task of writingabout a thousand words a day, or about three typedpages. He did not consider his work done, however,until he had revised that thousand words down toabout  three  hundred.  His  sentences  were  short.His words were simple. His constructions were un-complicated, his prose electrified. He assured him-self of its electricity by reading what he wrote eachday to his wife. When she got goose bumps fromwhat he read her, he knew that he was on target.
ESTJ	 was a consciously masculine writer.His  protagonists,  with  the  possible  exception  ofJake  Barnes  inThe  Sun  Also  Rises,  were  men  en-gaged  in  extreme  external  conflicts.  The  formsthese took included the solitary conflict of Santi-ago inThe Old Man and the Seaas he tried to beachhis fish after a three-day struggle; that of the bull-fighter inDeath in the Afternoon; the adventurers inThe Green Hills of Africa; his autobiographical char-acter, Frederic Henry, inA Farewell to Arms; or Rob-ert Jordan, who fought along with the Spanish loy-alists inFor Whom the Bell Tolls.In nearly everything he wrote, 
ESTJ	 de-picted courage as he defined the word: grace un-der pressure. He was fearful lest he not be consid-ered  courageous  himself,  and  he  rankled  whenWilliam Faulkner, who was awarded the Nobel Prizein Literature four years before 
ESTJ	 receivedit in 1954, was quoted in an interview as suggestingthat 
ESTJ	 was lacking in courage—an astuteobservation on Faulkner’s part.
ESTJ	 learned much about literary style,especially about depicting human speech authenti-cally,  from  Stein.  He,  in  turn,  became  a  stylisticmodel for such modern writers as James Jones, Nel-son Algren, and Norman Mailer. Perhaps no othertwentieth century American author has been thespiritual progenitor to as many notable literary off-spring.Whereas Faulkner examined his native Missis-sippi  microscopically  in  his  work,  
ESTJ	Ernest 
ESTJ	1070bolted  from  the  environment  in  which  he  hadgrown  up.  His  major  work  explores  foreign  cul-tures in one way or another. If his cast of charac-ters is American, as it often is, these characters liveout their roles in foreign, usually hostile, environ-ments. Moving people away from all that is most fa-miliar to them heightens the pressure under whichthey  must  perform,  and  that  is  clearly  a  part  of
ESTJ	’s technique. Even Santiago inThe OldMan and the Sea, although he is adrift in his fishingskiff in the waters off his native land, finds himselfalone in a huge, hostile environment.The Old Man and the Seais, however, differentfrom most of the others. In it, 
ESTJ	 is moremellow than in any of his earlier work. He is stilltough, but the old man survives, and although thesharks that close in on his boat strip the flesh fromhis prized catch, he has the satisfaction of havingprevailed in the struggle. It is this book that tippedthe balance in favor of 
ESTJ	’s winning theNobel Prize. His earlier work had not been affir-mative enough to reflect the Nobel Foundation’sguidelines.The  Old  Man  and  the  Sea,  although  itdoes not retreat from 
ESTJ	’s basic themes,ends on a note of subdued triumph.
ISTJ	I DECIDE TO PLAY HOOKEYA steak-and-kidney pie, influenza, and a cablegram. There is thetriple alliance that is responsible for the whole thing. Though theremight have been a bit of homesickness and a desire for applause mixedup in the cycle of circumstances that started me off to Europe for avacation.For seven years I had been basking in California's perpetual sunlight,a sunlight artificially enhanced by the studio Cooper-Hewitts. Forseven years I had been working and thinking along in a single channeland I wanted to get away. Away from Hollywood, the cinema colony, awayfrom scenarios, away from the celluloid smell of the studios, awayfrom contracts, press notices, cutting rooms, crowds, bathingbeauties, custard pies, big shoes, and little moustaches. I was in theatmosphere of achievement, but an achievement which, to me, wasrapidly verging on stagnation.I wanted an emotional holiday. Perhaps I am projecting at the start adifficult condition for conception, but I assure you that even theclown has his rational moments and I needed a few.The triple alliance listed above came about rather simultaneously. Ihad finished the picture of 'The Kid' and 'The Idle Class' and wasabout to embark on another. The company had been engaged. Script andsettings were ready. We had worked on the picture one day.I was feeling very tired, weak, and depressed. I had just recoveredfrom an attack of influenza. I was in one of those 'what's the use'moods. I wanted something and didn't know what it was.And then Montague Glass invited me to dinner at his home in Pasadena.There were many other invitations, but this one carried with it theassurance that there would be a steak-and-kidney pie. A weakness ofmine. I was on hand ahead of time. The pie was a symphony. So was theevening. Monty Glass, his charming wife, their little daughter, LuciusHitchcock, the illustrator, and his wife--just a homey little familyparty devoid of red lights and jazz orchestras. It awoke within me achord of something reminiscent. I couldn't quite tell what.After the final onslaught on the pie, into the parlour before an openfire. Conversation, not studio patois nor idle chatter. An exchange ofideas--ideas founded on ideas. I discovered that Montague Glass wasmuch more than the author of _Potash and Perlmutter_. He thought. Hewas an accomplished musician.He played the piano. I sang. Not as an exponent of entertainment, butas part of the group having a pleasant, homey evening. We playedcharades. The evening was over too soon. It left me wishing. Here washome in its true sense. Here was a man artistically and commerciallysuccessful who still managed to lock the doors and put out the cat atnight.I drove back to Los Angeles. I was restless. There was a cablegramwaiting for me from London. It called attention to the fact that mylatest picture, 'The Kid,' was about to make its appearance in London,and, as it had been acclaimed my best, this was the time for me tomake the trip back to my native land. A trip that I had been promisingmyself for years.What would Europe look like after the war?I thought it over. I had never been present at the first showing ofone of my pictures. Their debut to me had been in Los Angelesprojection rooms. I had been missing something vital and stimulating.I had success, but it was stored away somewhere. I had never openedthe package and tasted it. I sort of wanted to be patted on the back.And I rather relished the pats coming in and from England. They hadhinted that I could, so I wanted to turn London upside down. Whowouldn't want to do that? And all the time there was the spectre ofnervous breakdown from overwork threatening and the results ofinfluenza apparent, to say nothing of the steak-and-kidney pie.Sensation of the pleasantest sort beckoned me, at the same time restwas promised. I wanted to grab it while it was good. Perhaps 'The Kid'might be my last picture. Maybe there would never be another chancefor me to bask in the spotlight. And I wanted to see Europe--England,France, Germany, and Russia. Europe was new.It was too much. I stopped preparations on the picture we were taking.Decided to leave the next night for Europe. And did it despite theprotests and the impossibility howlers. Tickets were taken. We packed;everyone was shocked. I was glad of it. I wanted to shock everyone.The next night I believe that most of Hollywood was at the train inLos Angeles to see me off. And so were their sisters and their cousinsand their aunts. Why was I going? A secret mission, I told them. Itwas an effective answer. I was immediately under contract to dopictures in Europe in the minds of most of them. But then, would theyhave believed or understood if I had told them I wanted an emotionalholiday? I don't believe so.There was the usual station demonstration at the train. The crowdrather surprised me. It was but a foretaste. I do not try to rememberthe shouted messages of cheer that were flung at me. They were of theusual sort, I imagine. One, however, sticks. My brother Syd at thelast moment rushed up to one of my party.'For God's sake, don't let him get married!' he shouted.It gave the crowd a laugh and me a scare.The train pulled out and I settled down to three days of relaxationand train routine. I ate sometimes in the dining car, sometimes in ourdrawing-room. I slept atrociously. I always do. I hate travelling. Thefaces left on the platform at Los Angeles began to look kinder andmore attractive. They did not seem the sort to drive one away. Butthey had, or maybe it was optical illusion on my part, illusionfostered by mental unrest.For two thousand miles we did the same thing over many times, thenrepeated it. Perhaps there were many interesting people on the train.I did not find out. The percentage of interesting ones on trains istoo small to hazard. Most of the time we played solitaire. You canplay it many times in two thousand miles.Then we reached Chicago. I like Chicago, I have never been there forany great length of time, but my glimpses of it have disclosedtremendous activity. Its record speaks achievement.But to me, personally, Chicago suggested Carl Sandburg, whose poetry Iappreciate highly and whom I had met in Los Angeles. I must see dearold Carl and also call at the office of the _Daily News_. They wererunning an enormous scenario contest. I am one of the judges, and ithappens that Carl Sandburg is on the same paper.Our party went to the Blackstone Hotel, where a suite had been placedat our disposal. The hotel management overwhelmed us with courtesies.Then came the reporters. You can't describe them unless you label themwith the hackneyed interrogation point.'Mr. Chaplin, why are you going to Europe?''Just for a vacation.''Are you going to make pictures while you are there?''No.''What do you do with your old moustaches?''Throw them away.''What do you do with your old canes?''Throw them away.''What do you do with your old shoes?''Throw them away.'That lad did well. He got in all those questions before he wasshouldered aside and two black eyes boring through lenses surroundedby tortoise-shell frames claimed an innings. I restored the 'propgrin' which I had decided was effective for interviews.'Mr. Chaplin, have you your cane and shoes with you?''No.''Why not?''I don't think I'll need them.''Are you going to get married while you are in Europe?''No.'  [Illustration: THE CALIFORNIAN SEA LION   THE ORIGIN OF THE FAMOUS BOOTS REVEALED AT LAST.   (_One of my favourite cartoons._)]The bespectacled one passed with the tide. As he passed I letthe grin slip away, but only for a moment. Hastily I recalled it as acharming young lady caught me by the arm.'Mr. Chaplin, do you ever expect to get married?''Yes.''To whom?''I don't know.''Do you want to play 'Hamlet'?''Why, I don't know. I haven't thought much about it, but if you thinkthere are any reasons why----'But she was gone. Another district attorney had the floor.'Mr. Chaplin, are you a Bolshevik?''No.''Then why are you going to Europe?''For a holiday.''What holiday?''Pardon me, folks, but I did not sleep well on the train and I must goto bed.'Like a football player picking a hole in the line, I had seen thebedroom door open and a friendly hand beckon. I made for it. Within Ihad every opportunity to anticipate the terror that awaited me on myholiday. Not the crowds. I love them. They are friendly andinstantaneous. But interviewers! Then we went to the _News_ office,and the trip was accomplished without casualty. There we metphotographers. I didn't relish facing them. I hate still pictures.But it had to be done. I was the judge in the contest and they musthave pictures of the judge.Now I had always pictured a judge as being a rather dignifiedpersonage, but I learned about judges from them. Their idea of the wayto photograph a judge was to have him standing on his head or with oneleg pointing east. They suggested a moustache, a Derby hat, and acane.It was inevitable.I couldn't get away from Chaplin.And I did so want a holiday.But I met Carl Sandburg. There was an oasis amid the misery. Good oldCarl! We recalled the days in Los Angeles. It was a most pleasantchat.Back to the hotel.Reporters. More reporters. Lady reporters.A publicity barrage.'Mr. Chaplin--'But I escaped. What a handy bedroom! There must be something inpractice. I felt that I negotiated it much better on the secondattempt. I rather wanted to try out my theory to see if I had becomean adept in dodging into the bedroom. I would try it. I went out tobrave the reporters. But they were gone. And when I ducked back intothe bedroom, as a sort of rehearsal, it fell flat. The effect was lostwithout the cause.A bit of food, some packing, and then to the train again. This timefor New York. Crowds again. I liked them. Cameras. I did not mindthem this time, as I was not asked to pose.Carl was there to see me off.I must do or say something extra nice to him. Something he couldappreciate. I couldn't think. I talked inanities and I felt that heknew I was being inane. I tried to think of a passage of his poetry torecite. I couldn't. Then it came--the inspiration.'Where can I buy your book of poems, Carl?' I almost blurted it out.It was gone. Too late to be recalled.'At any bookstore.'His reply may have been casual. To me it was damning.Ye gods, what a silly imbecile I was! I needed rest. My brain wasgone. I couldn't think of a thing to say in reprieve. Thank God, thetrain pulled out then. I hope Carl will understand and forgive when hereads this, if he ever does.A wretched sleep _en train_, more solitaire, meals at schedule times,and then we hit New York.Crowds. Reporters. Photographers. And Douglas Fairbanks. Good oldDoug. He did his best, but Doug has never had a picture yet where hehad to buck news photographers. They snapped me in every postureanatomically possible. Two of them battled with my carcass in argumentover my facing east or west.Neither won. But I lost. My body couldn't be split. But my clothescould--and were.But Doug put in a good lick and got me into an automobile. Panting, Ilay back against the cushions.To the Ritz went Doug and 
ISTJ	To the Ritz went the crowd.Or at least I thought so, for there was a crowd there and it lookedlike the same one. I almost imagined I saw familiar faces. Certainly Isaw cameras. But this time our charge was most successful. With aguard of porters as shock troops, we negotiated the distance betweenthe curb and the lobby without the loss of a single button.I felt rather smart and relieved. But, as usual, I was too previous.We ascended to the suite. There they were. The gentlemen of the press.And one lady of the press.'Mr. Chaplin, why are you going to Europe?''For a vacation.''What do you do with your old moustaches?''Throw them away.''Do you ever expect to get married?''Yes.''What's her name?''I don't know.''Are you a Bolshevik?''I am an artist. I am interested in life. Bolshevism is a new phase oflife. I must be interested in it.''Do you want to play 'Hamlet'?''Why, I don't know--'Again Lady Luck flew to my side. I was called to the telephone. Ianswered the one in my bedroom, and closed the door, and kept itclosed. The Press departed. I felt like a wrung dish-rag. I lookedinto the mirror. I saw a Cheshire cat grinning back at me. I was stillcarrying the 'prop' grin that I had invented for interviews. Iwondered if it would be easier to hold it all the time rather thanchase it into play at the sight of reporters. But some one mightaccuse me of imitating Doug. So I let the old face slip back tonormal.Doug came. Mary was better. She was with him. It was good to see her.The three of us went to the roof to be photographed. We were, in everyconceivable pose until some one suggested that Doug should hang overthe edge of the roof, holding Mary in one hand and me in the other.Pretty little thought. But that's as far as it got. I beat Doug to therefusal by a hair.It's great to have friends like Doug and Mary. They understood meperfectly. They knew what the seven years' grind had meant to mynerves. They knew just how badly I needed this vacation, how I neededto get away from studios and pictures, how I needed to get away frommyself.Doug had thought it all out and had planned that while I was in NewYork my vacation should be perfect. He would see that things were keptpleasant for me.So he insisted that I should go and see his new picture, 'The ThreeMusketeers.'I was nettled. I didn't want to see pictures. But I was polite. I didnot refuse, though I did try to evade.It was useless. Very seriously he wanted me to see the picture andgive my honest opinion. He wanted my criticism, my suggestions.I had to do it. I always do. I saw the picture in jerks.Reporters were there. Their attendance was no secret.The picture over, I suggested a few changes and several cuts which Ithought would improve it.I always do.They listened politely and then let the picture ride the way it was.They always do.Fortunately, the changes I suggested were not made, and the picture isa tremendous success.But I still have status as a critic. I am invited to a showing ofMary's picture, 'Little Lord Fauntleroy,' and asked for suggestions.They know that I'll criticise. I always do and they are afraid of me.Though when they look at my pictures they are always kind andsympathetic and never criticise.I told Mary her picture was too long. I told her where to cut it.Which, of course, she doesn't do. She never does.She and Doug listen politely and the picture stands. It always does.Newspaper men are at the hotel. I go through the same barrage ofquestions. My 'prop' grin does duty for fifteen minutes. I escape.Douglas 'phones me. He wants to be nice to me. I am on my vacation andhe wants it to be a very pleasant one. So he invites me to see 'TheThree Musketeers' again. This time at its first showing before thepublic.Before the opening of Doug's picture we were to have dinner together,Mary and Doug, Mrs. Conde Nast and 
ISTJ	I felt very embarrassed at meeting Mrs. Nast again. Somewhere therelurks in my memory a broken dinner engagement. It worried me, as I hadnot even written. It was so foolish not to write. I would be metprobably with an 'all-is-forgiven' look.I decide that my best defence is to act vague and not speak of it. Ido so and get away with it.And she has the good taste not to mention it, so a pleasant time ishad by all.We went to the theatre in Mrs. Nast's beautiful limousine. The crowdswere gathered for several blocks on every side of the theatre.I felt proud that I was in the movies. Though on this night, withDouglas and Mary, I felt that I was trailing in their glory. It wastheir night.There are cheers--for Mary, for Doug, for me. Again I feel proud thatI am in the movies. I try to look dignified. I coax up the 'prop'smile and put into it real pleasure. It is a real smile. It feels goodand natural.We get out of the car and crowds swarm. Most of the 'all-American'selections are there. Doug takes Mary under his wing and ploughsthrough as though he were doing a scene and the crowd were extras.I took my cue from him. I took Mrs. Nast's arm. At least I tried totake it, but she seemed to sort of drift away from me down towardsEighth Avenue, while I, for no apparent reason, backed towardBroadway. The tide changed. I was swept back toward the entrance ofthe theatre. I was not feeling so proud as I had been. I was stillsmiling at the dear public, but it had gone back to the 'prop' smile.I realised this and tried to put real pleasure into the smile again.As the grin broadened it opened new space and a policeman parked hisfist in it.I don't like the taste of policemen's fists. I told him so. He glaredat me and pushed me for a 'first down.' My hat flew toward theheavens. It has never returned to me.I felt a draught. I heard machinery. I looked down. A woman with apair of scissors was snipping a piece from the seat of my trousers.Another grabbed my tie and almost put an end to my suffering throughstrangulation. My collar was next. But they only got half of that.My shirt was pulled out. The buttons torn from my vest. My feettrampled on. My face scratched. But I still retained the smile, 'prop'one though it was. Whenever I could think of it I tried to raise itabove the level of a 'prop' smile and was always rewarded with apoliceman's fist. I kept insisting that I was Charlie Chaplin and thatI belonged inside. It was absolutely necessary that I should see 'TheThree Musketeers.'Insistence won. As though on a prearranged signal I felt myself liftedfrom my feet, my body inverted until my head pointed toward the centreof the lobby and my feet pointed toward an electric sign advertisingthe Ziegfeld Roof. Then there was a surge, and I moved forward rightover the heads of the crowd through the lobby.As I went through the door, not knowing into what, I saw a friend.With the 'prop' smile still waving, I flung back, 'See you later,'and, head first, I entered the theatre and came to in a heap at thefoot of a bediamonded dowager. I looked up, still carrying the 'prop'smile, but my effort fell flat. There was no applause in the look shegave me.Crestfallen, I gathered myself together, and with what dignity therewas left I strode to the box that had been set aside for our party.There was Mary, as sweet and beautiful as ever; Mrs. Nast, calm andcomposed: Doug serene and dapper.'Late again,' they looked.And Mary, steely polite, enumerated my sartorial shortcomings. But Iknew one of them, at least better than she did, and I hastened to themen's room for repairs. Soap and water and a brush did wonders, but Icould find no trousers, collar, or tie, and I returned clean butragged to the box, where disapproval was being registered unanimously.I tried to make the 'prop' grin more radiant, even though I was mosttired after my journey, but it didn't go with Doug and Mary.But I refused to let them spoil my pleasure and I saw 'The ThreeMusketeers.'It was a thrilling success for Doug. I felt good for him, though I wasa bit envious. I wondered if the showing of 'The Kid' could have meantas big a night for me.'Twas quite a night, this opening of the Fairbanks masterpiece, and,considering all the circumstances, I think I behaved admirably.Somehow, though, I think there is a vote of three to one against me.I
ISTJ	OFF TO EUROPENext morning there was work to do. My lawyer, Nathan Burkan, had to beseen. There were contracts and other things. Almost as much a nuisanceas interviews. But I dare say they are necessary.Poor old Nath! I love him, but am afraid of him. His pockets alwaysbulge contracts. We could be such good friends if he were not alawyer. And I am sure that there must be times when he is delightfulcompany. I might fire him and then get acquainted.A very dull day with him. Interrupted by 'phones, invitations,parties, theatre tickets sent to me, people asking for jobs. Hundredsof letters camouflaged with good wishes and invariably asking favours.But I like them.Calls from many old friends who depress me and many new ones whothrill me. I wanted some buckwheat cakes. I had to go three blocks toa Childs' restaurant to get them.That night I went to see 'Liliom,' the best play in New York at thetime and one which in moments rises to true greatness. It impressed metremendously and made me dissatisfied with myself. I don't like beingwithout work. I want to go on the stage. Wonder if I could play thatpart?I went back behind the scenes and met young Skildkraut. I was amazedat his beauty and youth. Truly an artist, sincere and simple. And EvaLe Gallienne, I recall no one else on the stage just like her. She isa charming artist. We renewed our acquaintance made in Los Angeles.The next morning provided a delightful treat. Breakfast for me,luncheon for the others, at the Coffee House Club, a most interestinglittle place where artists and artizans belong--writers, actors,musicians, sculptors, painters--all of them interesting people. I gothere often whenever I am in New York. It was a brilliant party,Heywood Broun, Frank Crowninshield, Harrison Rhodes, Edward Knoblock,Conde Nast, Alexander Woolcott--but I can't remember all the names. Iwish all meals were as pleasant.I received an invitation to dine with Ambassador Gerard and then gofor a ride in the country. The motor broke down, as they usually do onsuch occasions, and I had to 'phone and disappoint. I was sorry,because I was to meet some brilliant people.I had luncheon next day with Max Eastman, one of my best friends. Heis a radical and a poet and editor of _The Liberator_, a charming andsympathetic fellow who thinks. All of his doctrines I do not subscribeto, but that makes no difference in our friendship. We get together,argue a bit, and then agree to disagree and let it go at that andremain friends.He told me of a party that he was giving at his home that evening andI hastened to accept his invitation to attend. His home is alwaysinteresting. His friends likewise.What a night it was for me! I got out of myself. My emotions went thegamut of tears to laughter without artificiality. It was what I hadleft Los Angeles for, and that night Charlie Chaplin seemed very faraway, and I felt or wanted to feel myself just a simple soul amongother souls.I was introduced to George, an ex-
ISTJ	 W. W. secretary. I suppose he hasa last name, but I didn't know it and it didn't seem to matter whenone met George. Here was a real personality. He had a light in hiseyes that I have never seen before, a light that must have shone fromhis soul. He had the look of one who believes he is right and has thecourage of his convictions. It is a scarce article.I learned that he had been sentenced by Judge Landis to serve twentyyear in the penitentiary, that he had served two years and was outbecause of ill-health. I did not learn the offence. It did not seem tomatter.A dreamer and a poet, he became wistfully gay on this hectic nightamong kindred spirits. In a mixed crowd of intellectuals he stood out.He was going back to serve his eighteen years in the penitentiary andwas remaining jovial. What an ordeal! But ordeal signifies what itwould have been for me. I don't believe it bothered him. I hardlybelieve he was there. He was somewhere else in the place from whichthat look in his eyes emanated. A man whose ideas are ideals.I pass no opinion, but with such charm one must sympathise.It was an amusing evening. We played charades and I watched Georgeact. It was all sorts of fun. We danced a bit.Then George came in imitating Woodrow. It was screamingly funny, andhe threw himself into the character, or caricature, making Wilson seemabsurdly ridiculous. We were convulsed with laughter.But all the time I couldn't help thinking that he must go back to thepenitentiary for eighteen years.What a party!It didn't break up until two in the morning, though clock or calendardidn't get a thought from me.We all played, danced, and acted. No one asked me to walk funny, noone asked me to twirl a cane. If I wanted to do a tragic bit, I did,and so did everyone else. You were a creature of the present, not aproduction of the past, not a promise of the future. You were acceptedas is, _sans_ 'Who's Who' labels and income-tax records.George asks me about my trip, but he does not interview. He gives meletters to friends.In my puny way, sounding hollow and unconvincing, I try to tell Georgehow foolish he is. He tries to explain that he can't help it. Like alltrail blazers, he is a martyr. He does not rant. He blames no one. Hedoes not rail at fate.If he believes himself persecuted, his belief is unspoken. He isalmost Christlike as he explains to me. His viewpoint is beautiful,kind, and tender.I can't imagine what he has done to be sentenced to twenty years. Mythought must speak. He believes he is spoiling my party through makingme serious. He doesn't want that.He stops talking about himself. Suddenly he runs, grabs a woman's hat,and says, 'Look, Charlie, I'm Sarah Bernhardt!' and goes into a mostridiculous travesty.I laugh. Everyone laughs. George laughs.And he is going back to the penitentiary to spend eighteen of the mostwonderful years of his life!I can't stand it. I go out in the garden and gaze up at the stars. Itis a wonderful night and a glorious moon is shining down. I wish therewas something I could do for George. I wonder if he is right or wrong.Before long George joins me. He is sad and reflective, with a sadnessof beauty, not of regret. He looks at the moon, the stars. Heconfides, how stupid is the party, any party, compared with theloveliness of the night. The silence that is a universal gift--how fewof us enjoy it. Perhaps because it cannot be bought. Rich men buynoise. Souls revel in nature's silences. They cannot be denied thosewho seek them.We talk of George's future. Not of his past nor of his offence. Can'the escape? I try to make him think logically toward regaining hisfreedom. I want to pledge my help. He doesn't understand, or pretendsnot to. He has not lost anything. Bars cannot imprison his spirit.I beg him to give himself and his life a better chance.He smiles.'Don't bother about me, Charlie. You have your work. Go on making theworld laugh. Yours is a great task and a splendid one. Don't botherabout me.'We are silent. I am choked up. I feel a sort of pent-up helplessness.I want relief. It comes.The tears roll down my cheeks and George embraces me.There are tears in both our eyes.'Good-bye, Charlie.''Good-bye, George.'What a party! Its noise disgusts me now. I call my car. I go back tothe Ritz.George goes back to the 'pen.'Chuck Reisner, who played the big bully in 'The Kid,' called the nextday. He wants to go to Europe. Why? He doesn't know. He is emotionaland sensational. He is a pugilist and a song writer. A civil soldierof fortune. He doesn't like New York and thinks he wants to get backto California at once.We have breakfast together. It is a delightful meal because it is sodifferent from my usual lonely breakfast. Chuck goes on at a greatrate and succeeds in working up his own emotions until there are tearsin his eyes.I promise him all sorts of things to get rid of him. He knows it andtells me so. We understand each other very well. I promise him anengagement. Tell him he can always get a job with me if he doesn'twant too much money.He is indignant at some press notices that have appeared about me andwants to go down to newspaper row and kill a few reporters. Hefathers, mothers me in his rough way.We talk about everybody's ingratitude for what he and I have done forpeople. We have a mutual-admiration convention. Why aren't weappreciated more? We are both sour on the world and its hypocrisies.It's a great little game panning the world so long as you don't letyour sessions get too long or too serious.I had a luncheon engagement at the Coffee House Club with FrankCrowninshield, and we talked over the arrangements of a dinner which Iam giving to a few intimate friends. Frank is my social mentor, thoughI care little about society in the general acceptance of the term. Wearranged for a table at the Elysee Cafe and it was to be a mixedparty.Among the guests were Max Eastman, Harrison Rhodes, Edward Knoblock,Mme. Maeterlinck, Alexander Woolcott, Douglas Fairbanks and Mary,Heywood Broun, Rita Weiman, and Neysa McMein, a most charming girl forwhom I am posing.Frank Harris and Waldo Frank were invited, but were unable to attend.Perhaps there were others, but I can't remember, and I am sure theywill forgive me if I have neglected to mention them. I am alwaysconfused about parties and arrangements.The last minute sets me wild. I am a very bad organiser. I am alwaysleaving everything until the last minute, and as a rule no one showsup.This was the exception. For on this occasion everybody did turn up.And it started off like most parties; everybody was stiff and formal;I felt a terrible failure as a host. But in spite of Mr. Volsteadthere was a bit of 'golden water' to be had, and it saved the day.What a blessing at times!I had been worried since sending the invitations. I wondered how MaxEastman would mix with the others, but I was soon put at my ease,because Max is clever and is just as desirous of having a good time asanyone, in spite of intellectual differences. That night he seemed thenecessary ingredient to make the party.The fizz water must have something of the sort of thing that old Poncede Leon sought. Certainly it made us feel very young. Back tochildren we leaped for the night. There were games, music, dancing.And no wallflowers. Everyone participated.We began playing charades, and Doug and Mary showed us some cleveracting. They both got on top of a table and made believe he was theconductor of a trolley car and she was a passenger. After an orgy ofcalling out stations _en route_ the conductor came along to thepassenger and collected her fare. Then they both began dancing aroundthe floor, explaining that they were a couple of fairies dancing alongthe side of a brook, picking flowers. Soon Mary fell in and Douglasplunged in after her and pulled her up on the banks of the brook.That was their problem, and, guess though we would, we could not solveit.They gave the answer finally. It was 'Fairbanks.'Then we sang, and in Italian--at least it passed for that. I actedwith Mme. Maeterlinck. We played a burlesque on the great dying sceneof 'Camille.' But we gave it a touch that Dumas overlooked.When she coughed, I got the disease immediately, and was soon takenwith convulsions and died instead of Camille.We sang some more, we danced, we got up and made impromptu speeches onany given subject. None were about the party, but on subjects like'political economy,' 'the fur trade,' 'feminism.'Each one would try to talk intelligently and seriously on a givensubject for one minute. My subject was the 'fur trade.'I prefaced my talk by references to cats, rabbits, etc., and finishedup by diagnosing the political situation in Russia.For me the party was a great success. I succeeded in forgetting myselffor a while. I hope the rest of them managed to do the same thing.From the cafe the party went over to a little girl's house--she was afriend of Mr. Woolcott--and again we burst forth in music and dancing.We made a complete evening of it and I went to bed tired and exhaustedabout five in the morning.I want a long sleep, but am awakened by my lawyer at nine. He haspackages of legal documents and papers for me to sign, my orders aboutcertain personal things of great importance. I have a splittingheadache. My boat is sailing at noon, and altogether, with a lawyerfor a companion, it is a hideous day.All through the morning the telephone bell is ringing. Reporters. Ilisten several times, but it never varies.'Mr. Chaplin, why are you going to Europe?''To get rid of interviews,' I finally shout, and hang up the 'phone.Somehow, with invaluable assistance, we get away from the hotel andare on our way to the dock. My lawyer meets me there. He has come tosee me off. I tremble, though, for fear he has more business with me.I am criticised by my lawyer for talking so sharply the first thing inthe morning. That's just it. He always sees me the first thing in themorning. That's what makes me short.But it is too big a moment. Something is stirring within me. I amanxious and reluctant about leaving. My emotions are all mixed.It is a beautiful morning. New York looks much finer and nicer becauseI am leaving it. I am terribly troubled about passports and the usualprocedure about declaring income tax, but my lawyer reassures me thathe has fixed everything O.K. and that my name will work a lot ofinfluence with the American officials; but I am very dubious about itwhen I am met by the American officials at the port.I am terrified by American officials. I am extra nice to theofficials, and to my amazement they are extra nice to me. Everythingpasses off very easily.As usual, my lawyer was right. He had fixed everything. He is a goodlawyer.We could be such intimate friends if he wasn't.But I am too thrilled to give much time to pitying lawyers.I am going to Europe.The crowds of reporters, photographers, all sorts of traffic, pushing,shoving, opening passports, vises O.K.'d, stamped, in perfect, almostclocklike precision, I am shoved aboard.The newspaper battery pictorial and reportorial. There is no originalnote.'Mr. Chaplin, why are you going to Europe?'I feel that in this last moment I should be a bit more tolerant andpleasant, no matter how difficult. I bring forth the 'prop' smileagain.'For a vacation,' I answer.Then they go through the standard interview form and I try to beobliging.Mrs. John Carpenter is on the boat--was also invited to my party, butcouldn't attend--with her charming daughter, who has the face of anangel, also Mr. Edward Knoblock. We are all photographed. Doug andMary are there. Lots of people to see me off. Somehow I don't seeminterested in them very much. My mind is pretty well occupied. I amtrying to make conversation, but am more interested in the people andthe boat and those who are going to travel with me.Many of the passengers on the boat are bringing their children that Imay be introduced. I don't mind children.'I have seen you so many times in the pictures.'I find myself smiling at them graciously and pleasantly, especiallythe children.I doubt if I am really sincere in this, as it is too early in themorning. Despite the fact that I love children, I find them difficultto meet. I feel rather inferior to them. Most of them have assurance,have not yet been cursed with self-consciousness.And one has to be very much on his best behaviour with childrenbecause they detect our insincerity. I find there are quite a lot ofchildren on board.Everyone is so pleasant, especially those left behind. Handkerchiefsare waving. The boat is off. We start to move, the waters arechurning. Am feeling very sad, rather regretful--think what a nice manmy lawyer is.We turn around the bend and get into the channel. The crowds are butlittle flies now. In this fleeting dramatic moment there comes thefeeling of leaving something very dear behind.The camera man and many of his brothers are aboard. I discover him asI turn around. I did not want to discover anyone just then. I wantedto be alone with sky and water. But I am still Charlie Chaplin. I mustbe photographed--and am.We are passing the Statue of Liberty. He asks me to wave and throwkisses, which rather annoys me.The thing is too obvious. It offends my sense of sincerity.The Statue of Liberty is thrilling, dramatic, a glorious symbol. Iwould feel self-conscious and cheap in deliberately waving andthrowing kisses at it. I will be myself.I refuse.The incident of the photographic seeker before the Statue of Libertyupset me. I felt that he was trying to capitalise the statue. Hisrequest was deliberate, insincere. It offended me. It would have beenlike calling an audience to witness the placing of flowers upon agrave. Patriotism is too deep a feeling to depict in the posing for aphotograph. Why are attempts made to parade such emotions? I feel gladthat I have the courage to refuse.As I turn from the photographer I feel a sense of relief. I am to havea reprieve from such annoyances. Reporters for the while are leftbehind. It is a delicious sense of security.I am ready for the new adjustment. I am in a new world, a little cityof its own, where there are new people--people who may be eitherpleasant or unpleasant, and mine is the interesting job of placingthem in their proper category. I want to explore new lands and I feelthat I shall have ample opportunity on such an immense ship. The_Olympic_ is enormous and I conjure up all sorts of pleasure to be hadin its different rooms--Turkish baths, gymnasium, music rooms--itsRitz-Carlton restaurant, where everything is elaborate and of ornatesplendour. I find myself looking forward to my evening meal.We go to the Ritz grill to dine. Everyone is pleasant. I seem to sensethe feel of England immediately. Foreign food--a change of system--thedifferent bill of fare, with money in terms of pounds, shillings, andpence. And the dishes--pheasant, grouse, and wild duck. For the firsttime I feel the elegant gentleman, the man of means.I ask questions and discover that there are really some veryinteresting people aboard. But I resent anyone telling me about them.I want to discover them myself. I almost shout when someone tries toread me a passenger list. This is my desert island--I am going toexplore it myself. The prospect is intriguing. I am three thousandmiles from Hollywood and three thousand miles from Europe. For themoment I belong to neither.God be praised, I am myself.It is my little moment of happiness, the glorious 'to-day' that issandwiched in between the exhausting 'yesterday' of Los Angeles andthe portentous 'to-morrow' of Europe.For the moment I am content.II
ISTJ	DAYS ON SHIPBOARDI notice a thoughtful-looking, studious sort of man seated across fromus. He is reading a book, a different sort of book, if covers meananything. It looks formidable, a sort of intellectual fodder. I wonderwho he is. I weave all sorts of romance about him. I place him in allsorts of intellectual undertakings, though he may be a collegeprofessor. I would love to know him. I feel that he is interested inus. I mention it to Knoblock. He keeps looking at us. Knoblock tellsme he is Gillette, the safety-razor man. I feel like romancing abouthim more than ever. I wonder what he is reading? I would love to knowhim. It is our loss, I believe. And I never learned what the book wasthat he was reading.There are very few pretty girls aboard. I never have any luck thatway. And it is a weakness of mine. I feel that it would be awfullypleasant to cross the ocean with a number of nice girls who werepretty and who would take me as I am. We listened to the music andretired early, this because of a promise to myself that I would dolots of reading aboard. I have a copy of Max Eastman's poems, coloursof life, a volume of treasures. I try to read them, but am toonervous. The type passes in parade, but I assimilate nothing, so Iprepare to sleep and be in good shape for the morning. But that isalso impossible.I am beyond sleep to-night now. I am in something new, somethingpregnant with expectation. The immediate future is too alluring forsleep.How shall I be received in England? What sort of a trip shall I have?Whom shall I meet on board? The thoughts chased one another round mybrain and back again, all running into one another in their rambling.I get up at one o'clock. Decide to read again. This time H. G. Wells's_Outline of History_. Impossible! It doesn't register. I try to forceit by reading aloud. It can't be done. The tongue can't cheat thebrain, and right now reading is out of the question.I get up and go to see if Knoblock is in. He sleeps audibly andconvincingly. He is not making his debut.I go back to my room. I rather feel sorry for myself. If only theTurkish baths were open I could while a few hours of time away untilmorning. Thus I mediate. The last thing I remember it is four o'clockin the morning and the next thing eleven-thirty. I can hear a greatbit of excitement going on outside my cabin door. There are a lot oflittle children there with autograph books. I tell them that I willsign them later and have them leave the books with my secretary, TomHarrington.There is a composite squeal of pleasure at this and a sickening fearcomes over me. I call Tom. He enters amid a raft of autograph books. Istart to sign, then postpone it until after breakfast.Knoblock comes in all refreshed and with that radiant sort ofcheerfulness that I resent in the morning. Am I going to get up forlunch or will I have it in my cabin? There is a pleading lethargy thatsays, 'Take it in bed,' but I cannot overcome the desire to exploreand the feeling of expectancy of something about to happen--I was tosee somebody or meet somebody--so I decide to have luncheon in thedining-room. I am giving myself the emotional stimulus. Nothing comesoff. We meet nobody.After lunch a bit of exercise. We run around the deck for a couple ofmiles. It brings back thoughts of the days when I ran in Marathonraces. I feel rather self-conscious, however, as I am being pointedout by passengers. With each lap it gets worse. If there was only aplace where I could run with nobody looking. We finally stop and leanagainst the rail.All the stewards are curious. They are trying to pick me out. I noticeit and pretend not to notice it. I go up into the gymnasium and lookaround. There is every contrivance to give joy to healthy bodies. Andbest of all, nobody else is there. Wonderful!I try the weights, the rowing machine, the travelling rings, punch thebag a bit, swing some Indian clubs, and leap to the trapeze. Suddenlythe place is packed. News travels quickly aboard ship. Some come forthe purpose of exercising, like myself; others out of curiosity towatch me perform. I grow careless. I don't care to go through with it.I put on my coat and hat and go to my room, finding that the oldonce-discarded 'prop' smile is useful as I make my way through thecrowd.At four o'clock we have tea. I decide that the people are interesting.I love to meet so many. Perhaps they are the same ones I hated to seecome into the gym, but I feel no sense of being paradoxical. Thegymnasium belongs to individuals. The tea-room suggests and invitessocial intercourse. Somehow there are barriers and conventionalitiesthat one cannot break, for all the vaunted 'freedom of shipboard.' Ifeel it's a sort of awkward situation. How is it possible to meetpeople on the same footing? I hear of it, I read of it, but somehow Icannot meet people myself and stay myself.I immediately shift any blame from myself and decide that thefirst-class passengers are all snobs. I resolve to try thesecond-class or the third-class. Somehow I can't meet these people. Iget irritable and decide deliberately to seek the other classes ofpassengers and the boat crew.Another walk around the deck. The salt air makes me feel good inspite of my mental bothers. I look over the rail and see otherpassengers, second or third class, and in one large group the ship'sfiremen and stokers. They are the night force come on deck for abreath of air between working their shifts in the hellish heat below.They see and recognise me. To their coal-blackened faces come smiles.They shout 'Hooray!' 'Hello, Charlie!' Ah, I am discovered. But Itingle all over with pleasure. As those leathery faces crack intolines through the dust I sense sincerity. There is a friendly feeling.I warm to them.There is a game of cricket going on. That's intriguing. I lovecricket. Wish I could try my hand at it. Wish there was enoughspontaneity about first-cabin passengers to start a game. I wish Iwasn't so darn self-conscious. They must have read my thoughts. I aminvited timidly, then vociferously, to play a game. Their invitationcheers me. I feel one of them. A spirit of adventure beckons. I leapover the rail and right into the midst of it.I carry with me into the steerage just a bit ofself-consciousness--there are so many trying to play upon me. I amlooked upon as a celebrity, not a cricket player. But I do my part andtry and we get into the game. Suddenly a motion-picture camera manbobs up from somewhere. What leeches! He snaps a picture. This getssickening.One of the crew has hurriedly made himself up as 'Charlie Chaplin.' Hecauses great excitement. This also impresses me. I find myself actinga part, looking surprised and interested. I am conscious of the factthat this thing has been done many times before. Then on secondthought I realise it is all new to them and that they mean well, so Itry to enter into the spirit of the thing. There comes a pause in thecricket game. Nobody is very much interested in it.I find that I have been resurrected again in character and am thecentre of attraction. There are calls, 'What have you done with yourmoustache?' I look up with a grin and ready to answer anything theyask, these chaps who labour hard and must play the same way. But I seethat hundreds of first-class passengers are looking down over the railas though at a side show. This affects my pride, though I dare say Iam supersensitive. I have an idea that they think I am 'Charlie'performing for them. This irritates me. I throw up my hands and say,'See you to-morrow.'One of the bystanders presents himself. 'Charlie, don't you rememberme?' I have a vague recollection of his face, but cannot place him.Now I have it, of course; we worked in some show together. Yes, I canactually place him. He has a negative personality. I remember that heplayed a small part, a chorus man or something of the sort. Thisbrings back all sorts of reminiscences, some depressing and othersinteresting. I wonder what his life has been. I remember him now veryplainly. He was a bad actor, poor chap. I never knew him very welleven when we worked in the same company. And now he is stoking in thehold of a ship. I think I know what his emotions are and understandthe reasons. I wonder whether he understands mine.I try to be nice, even though I discover the incident is not overinteresting. But I try to make it so--try harder just because he nevermeant a great deal before. But now it seems to take on a greatersignificance, the meeting with this chap, and I find myself beingextra nice to him, or at least trying to be.Darn it all, the first-class passengers are looking on again, and Iwill not perform for them. They arouse pride, indignation. I havedecided to become very exclusive on board. That's the way to treatthem.It is five o'clock. I decide to take a Turkish bath. Ah, what adifference travelling first class after the experience in thesteerage!There is nothing like money. It does make life so easy. These thoughtscome easily in the luxury of a warm bath. I feel a little more kindlydisposed toward the first-cabin passengers. After all, I am anemotional cuss.Discover that there are some very nice people on board. I get intoconversation with two or three. They have the same ideas about lots ofthings that I have. This discovery gives me a fit of introspectionand I discover that I am, indeed, a narrow-minded little pinhead.What peculiar sights one sees in a Turkish bath. The two extremes, fatand thin, and so seldom a perfect physique. I am a discoveredman--even in my nakedness. One man will insist upon showing me how todo a hand balance in the hot room. Also a somersault and a back flip.It challenges my nimbleness. Can I do them? Good heavens--no! I'm notan acrobat, I'm an actor. I am indignant.Then he points out the value of regular exercise, outlining for mybenefit a daily course for me to do aboard. I don't want any dailycourse and I tell him so.'But,' says he, 'if you keep this up for a week you may be able to dothe stunts I do.'But I can't see it even with that prospect ahead, because to save mylife I can't think of any use I would have for the hand balance,somersault, or the back flip.I meet another man who has manoeuvred until he has me pinned in acorner. He shows a vital interest in Theda Bara. Do I know her? Whatsort of a person is she? Does she 'vamp' in real life? Do I knowLouise Glaum? He sort of runs to the vampish ladies. Do I know any ofthe old-timers? So his conversation goes depressingly on, with meanswering mostly in the negative.  [Illustration: A scene from 'Sunnyside,' one of my favourite photo   plays.]They must think I am very dull. Why, anyone should know the answers tothe questions they figure. There are grave doubts as to whetherI am Charlie Chaplin or not. I wish they would decide that I am not. Iconfess that I have never met Theda Bara. They return to motionpictures of my own. How do I think up my funny stunts? It is too much.Considerably against my wishes I have to retreat from the hot room. Iwant to get away from this terrible, strenuous experience. But retreatis not so easy.A little rotund individual, smiling, lets me know that he has seen anumber of my pictures. He says:'I have seen you so much in 'reel' life that I wanted to talk to youin 'real' life.' He laughs at this bright little sally of his and Idare say he thinks it original. The first time I heard it I choked onmy milk bottle.But I grinned. I always do. He asked what I was taking a Turkish bathfor, and I told him I was afraid of acquiring a bit of a stomach. Iwas speaking his language. He knew the last word in taking downstomachs. He went through all the stomach-reducing routine. He rolled,he slapped, he stretched across a couch on his stomach while hebreathed deeply and counted a hundred. He had several other stunts butI stopped him. He had given me enough ideas for a beginning. He got uppanting, and I noticed that the most prominent thing about him was hisstomach and that he had the largest stomach in the room. But headmitted that the exercise had fixed him O.K.Eventually he glanced down at my feet. 'Good heavens! I always thoughtyou had big feet. Have you got them insured?' I can stand it nolonger. I burst through the door into the cooling room and on to theslab.At last I am where I can relax. The masseur is an Englishman and hasseen most of my pictures. He talks about 'Shoulder Arms.' He mentionsthings in my pictures that I never remembered putting there. He hadalways thought I was a pretty muscular guy, but was sadlydisappointed.'How do you do your funny falls?' He is surprised that I am notcovered with bruises. 'Do I know Clara Kimball Young? Are most of thepeople in pictures immoral?'I make pretences. I am asleep. I am very tired. An audience hasdrifted in and I hear a remark about my feet.I am manhandled and punched and then handed on into another room.At last I can relax. I am about to fall asleep when one of thepassengers asks if I would mind signing my autograph for him. But Iconquer them. Patience wins and I fall asleep to be awakened at seveno'clock and told to get out of the bath.I dress for dinner. We go into the smoking-room. I meet the demoncamera man. I do not know him, as he is dressed up like a regularperson. We get into conversation. Well, hardly conversation. He talks.'Listen, Charlie, I am very sorry, but I've been assigned tophotograph you on this trip. Now we might as well get to know eachother and make it easy for both of us, so the best thing to do is tolet's do it fully and get it over with. Now, let's see, I'll taketo-morrow and part of the next day. I want to photograph you with thethird-class passengers, then the second-class, and have you shownplaying games on deck. If you have your make-up and your moustache,hat, shoes, and cane, it will be all the better.'I call for help. He will have to see my personal representative, Mr.Robinson.He says, 'I won't take 'No' for an answer.'And I let him know that the only thing he isn't going to do on thetrip is to photograph me. I explain that it would be a violation ofcontract with the First National exhibitors.'I have been assigned to photograph you and I'm going to photographyou,' he says. And then he told me of his other camera conquests, ofhis various experiences with politicians who did not want to bephotographed.'I had to break through the palace walls to photograph the King ofEngland, but I got him. Also had quite a time with Foch, but I havehis face in celluloid now.' And he smiled as he deprecatingly lookedup and down my somewhat small and slight figure.This is the last straw. I defy him to photograph me. For from now on Ihave made up my mind that I am going to lock myself in my cabin--I'llfool him.But my whole evening is spoiled. I go to bed cursing themotion-picture industry, the makers of film, and those responsible forcamera men. Why did I take the trip? What is it all for? It has gottenbeyond me already and it is my trip, my vacation.It is early, and I decide to read a bit. I pick up a booklet of poemsby Claude McKay, a young negro poet who is writing splendid verse ofthe inspired sort. Reading a few of his gems, my own annoyances seempuny and almost childish.I read:The Tropics of New York.     Bananas ripe and green, and ginger root,       Cocoa in pods and alligator pears,     And tangerines and mangos and grapefruit,       Fit for the highest prize at parish fairs.     See in the windows, bringing memories       Of fruit trees laden, by low-singing rills,     And dewy dawns and mystical blue skies.       In benediction over nunlike hills.     Mine eyes grow dim and I could no more gaze.       A wave of longing through my body swept,     And a hunger for the old, familiar ways;       I turned aside and bowed my head and wept.I read again:     Lovely, dainty Spanish Needle,       With your yellow flower and white;     Dew-decked and softly sleeping;       Do you think of me to-night?     Shadowed by the spreading mango       Nodding o'er the rippling stream,     Tell me, dear plant of my childhood,       Do you of the exile dream?     Do you see me by the brook's side,       Catching grayfish 'neath the stone,     As you did the day you whispered:       'Leave the harmless dears alone?'     Do you see me in the meadow,       Coming from the woodland spring,     With a bamboo on my shoulder       And a pail slung from a string?     Do you see me, all expectant,       Lying in an orange grove,     While the swee-swees sing above me,       Waiting for my elf-eyed love?     Lovely, dainty Spanish Needle;       Source to me of sweet delight,     In your far-off sunny Southland       Do you dream of me to-night?I am passing this along because I don't believe it is published inthis country, and I feel as though I am extending a rare treat. Theybrought me better rest that night--a splendid sleep.Next morning there were more autograph books and several wirelessmessages from intimate friends wishing me _bon voyage_. They are allvery interesting.Also there are about two hundred ship postcards. Would I mind signingthem for the stewards? I am feeling very good-natured and I enjoysigning anything this morning. I pass the forenoon till lunch time.I really feel as though I haven't met anybody. They say that barriersare lowered aboard ship, but not for me.Ed. Knoblock and I keep very much to ourselves. But all the time Ihave been sort of wondering what became of the beautiful opera singerwho came aboard and was photographed with me. I wonder if beingphotographed together constitutes an introduction? I have not seen hersince the picture.We get seats in deck chairs. Knoblock and myself. Ed. is busy reading_Economic Democracy_ by some one important. I have splendid intentionsof reading Wells's _Outline of History_. My intentions falter after afew paragraphs. I look at the sea, at people passing all around theship. Every once in a while I glance at Knoblock hoping that he isovercome by his book and that he will look up, but Knoblock apparentlyhas no such intention.Suddenly I notice, about twenty chairs away, the beautiful singer. Idon't know why I always have this peculiar embarrassment that grips menow. I am trying to make up my mind to go over and make myself known.No, such an ordeal would be too terrific. The business of makingoneself known is a problem. Here she is within almost speakingdistance and I am not sure whether I shall meet her or not. I glanceaway again. She is looking in my direction. I pretend not to see herand quickly turn my head and get into conversation with Knoblock, whothinks I have suddenly gone insane.'Isn't that lady the opera singer?' I ask.'Yes.'That about expresses his interest.'Shouldn't we go over and make ourselves known?' I suggest.'By all means, if you wish it.' And he is up and off almost before Ican catch my breath.We get up and walk around the deck. I just do not know how to meetpeople. At last the moment comes in the smoking-room, where they arehaving 'log auction.' She is with two gentlemen. We meet. Sheintroduces one as her husband, the other as a friend.She reprimands me for not speaking to her sooner. I try to pretendthat I had not seen her. This amuses her mightily and she becomescharming. We become fast friends. Both she and her husband join us atdinner the following night. We recall mutual friends. Discover thatthere are quite a lot of nice people aboard. She is Mme. Namara and inprivate life Mrs. Guy Bolton, wife of the author of 'Sally.' They areon their way to London where he is to witness the English opening of'Sally.' We have a delightful evening at dinner and then later intheir cabin.IV.HELLO, ENGLAND!Everything sails along smoothly and delightfully until the night ofthe concert for the seaman's fund. This entertainment is customary onall liners and usually is held on the last night out. The passengersprovide the entertainment.I am requested to perform. The thought scares me. It is a greattragedy, and, much as I would like to do something, I am too exhaustedand tired. I beg to be excused, I never like making appearances inpublic. I find that they are always disappointing.I give all manner of reasons for not appearing--one that I have noparticular thing to do, nothing arranged for, that it is against myprinciples because it spoils illusion--especially for the children.When they see me minus my hat, cane, and shoes, it is like taking thewhiskers off Santa Claus. And not having my equipment with me, I feelvery conscious of this. I am always self-conscious when meetingchildren without my make-up for that very reason. I must say theofficers were very sympathetic and understood my reasons for notwanting to appear, and I can assure you that the concert was adistinct success without me. There were music and recitations andsinging and dancing, and one passenger did a whistling act, imitatingvarious birds and animals, also the sawing of wood, with thescreeching sound made when the saw strikes a knot. It was veryeffective.I watched and enjoyed the concert immensely until near the end, whenthe entertainment chairman announced that I was there and that if theaudience urged strongly enough I might do something for them. This wasvery disconcerting, and after I had explained that I was physicallyexhausted and had nothing prepared I am sure the audience understood.The chairman, however, announced that it did not matter, as they couldsee Charlie Chaplin at any time for a nickel--and that's that.The next day is to be the last aboard. We are approaching land. I havegot used to the boat and everybody has got used to me. I have ceasedto be a curiosity. They have taken me at my face value--face withoutmoustache and kindred make-up. We have exchanged addresses, cards,invitations; have made new friends, met a lot of charming people,names too numerous to mention.The lighter is coming out. The top deck is black with men. Somebodytells me they are French and British camera men coming to welcome me.I am up on the top deck, saying good-bye to Mme. Namara and herhusband. They are getting off at Cherbourg. We are staying aboard.Suddenly there is an avalanche. All sorts and conditions of men armedwith pads, pencils, motion-picture cameras, still cameras. There is anembarrassing pause. They are looking for Charlie Chaplin. Some haverecognised me. I see them searching among our little group. EventuallyI am pointed out.'Why, here he is!'My friends suddenly become frightened and desert me. I feel very muchalone, the victim. Square-headed gentlemen with mannersdifferent--they are raising their hats.'Do I speak French?' Some are speaking in French to me--it meansnothing, I am bewildered. Others English. They all seem too curious toeven do their own business. I find that they are personallyinterested. Camera men are forgetting to shoot their pictures.But they recover themselves after their curiosity has been gratified.Then the deluge.'Are you visiting in London?''Why did you come over?''Did you bring your make-up?''Are you going to make pictures over here?'Then from Frenchmen:'Will I visit France?''Am I going to Russia?'I try to answer them all.'Will you visit Ireland?''I don't expect to do so.''What do you think of the Irish question?''It requires too much thought.''Are you a Bolshevik?''I am an artist, not a politician.''Why do you want to visit Russia?''Because I am interested in any new idea.''What do you think of Lenin?''I think him a very remarkable man.''Why?''Because he is expressing a new idea.''Do you believe in Bolshevism?''I am not a politician?'Others ask me to give them a message to France. A message to London.What have I to say to the people of Manchester? Will I meet BernardShaw? Will I meet H. G. Wells? Is it true that I am going to beknighted? How would I solve the unemployment problem?In the midst of all this a rather mysterious gentleman pulls me to oneside and tells me that he knew my father intimately and acted as agentfor him in his music-hall engagements. Did I anticipate working? Ifso, he could get me an engagement. Would I give him the firstopportunity? Anyway, he was very pleased to meet me. If I wanted anice quiet rest I could come down to his place and spend a few dayswith my kind of people, the people I liked.I am rescued by my secretaries, who insist that I go to my cabin andlie down. Anything the newspaper men have to ask they will answer forme. I am dragged away bewildered.Is this what I came six thousand miles for? Is this rest? Where isthat vacation that I pictured so vividly?I lie down and nap until dinner time. I have dinner in my cabin. Nowcomes another great problem.Tipping. One has the feeling that if you are looked at you should tip.One thing that I believe in, though--tipping. It gets you goodservice. It is money well spent. But when and how to tip--that is thequestion. It is a great problem on shipboard.There's the bedroom steward, the waiter, the head waiter, the hallboy,the deck steward, boots, bathroom steward, Turkish bath attendants,gymnasium instructor, smoking-room steward, lounge-room steward, pageboys, elevator boys, barber. It is depressing. I am harassed as towhether to tip the doctor and the captain.I am all excited now; full of expectancy. Wonder what's going tohappen. After my first encounter with fifty newspaper men atCherbourg, somehow I do not resent it. Rather like it, in fact. Beinga personage is not so bad. I am prepared for the fray. It is exciting.I am advancing on Europe. One o'clock. I am in my cabin. We are todock in the morning.I look out of the porthole. I hear voices. They are alongside thedock. Am very emotional now. The mystery of it out there in blacknessenvelops me. I revel in it--its promise. We are at Southampton. We arein England.To-morrow! I go to bed thinking of it. To-morrow!I try to sleep, childishly reasoning that in sleeping I will make thetime pass more quickly. My reasoning was sound, perhaps, but somewherein my anatomy there slipped a cog. I could not sleep. I rolled andtossed, counted sheep, closed my eyes and lay perfectly still, but itwas no go. Somewhere within me there stirred a sort of Christmas Evefeeling. To-morrow was too portentous.I look at my watch. It is two o'clock in the morning. I look throughthe porthole. It is pitch dark outside. I try to pierce the darkness,but can't. Off in the distance I hear voices coming out of the night.That and the lapping of the waves against the side of the boat.Then I hear my name mentioned once, twice, three times. I am thrilled.I tingle with expectancy and varying emotions. It is all so peculiarand mysterious. I try to throw off the feeling. I can't.There seems to be no one awake except a couple of men who are pacingthe deck. Longshoremen, probably. Every once in a while I hear themystic 'Charlie Chaplin' mentioned. I peer through the porthole. It isstarting to rain. This adds to the spell. I turn out the lights andget back to bed and try to sleep. I get up again and look out.I call Robinson. 'Can you sleep?' I ask.'No. Let's get up and dress.' It's got him, too.We get up and walk around the top deck. There is a curious mixture offeelings all at once. I am thrilled and depressed. I cannot understandthe depression. We keep walking around the deck, looking over theside. People are looking up, but they don't recognise me in the night.I feel myself speculating, wondering if it is going to be the welcomeI am expecting.Scores of messages have been arriving all day.'Will you accept engagements?' 'Will you dine with us?' 'How about afew days in the country?' I cannot possibly answer them all. Notreceiving replies, they send wireless messages to the captain.'Mr. Lathom, is Mr. Chaplin on board?' 'Has my message beendelivered?'I have never received so many messages. 'Will you appear on Tuesday?''Will you dine here?' 'Will you join a revue?' 'Are you open forengagements?' 'I am the greatest agent in the world.'One of the messages is from the Mayor of Southampton, welcoming me tothat city. Others from heads of the motion-picture industry in Europe.This is a source of great worriment. Welcomed by the mayor. It willprobably mean a speech. I hate speeches, I can't make them. This isthe worst spectre of the night.In my sleeplessness I go back to my cabin and try to write down what Ishall say, trying to anticipate what the mayor will say to me. Ipicture his speech of welcome. A masterpiece of oratory brought forthafter much preparation by those who are always making speeches. It istheir game, this speech-making, and I know I shall appear a hopelessdub with my reply.But I attack it valiantly. I write sentence after sentence and thenpractise before the mirror.'Mr. Mayor and the people of Southampton.' The face that peers back atme from the mirror looks rather silly. I think of Los Angeles andwonder how they would take my speech there. But I persevere. I writemore. I overcome that face in the looking-glass to such an extent thatI want a wider audience.I call Carl Robinson. I make him sit still and listen. I make myspeech several times. He is kind the first time and the second time,but after that he begins to get fidgety. He makes suggestions. I takeout some lines and put in others. I decide that it is prepared andleave it. I am to meet the mayor in the morning at eight o'clock.Eventually I get to bed and asleep, a fitful, tossing sleep. They wakeme in the morning. People are outside my door. Carl comes in.'The mayor is upstairs waiting for you.' I am twenty minutes late.This adds to my inefficiency.I am pushed and tumbled into my clothes, then taken by the arm, as ifI were about to be arrested, and led from my cabin. Good Lord! I'veforgotten my slip--my speech, my answer to the mayor, with itsplatform gestures that I had laboured with during the long night. Ibelieved that I had created some new gestures never before attemptedon platform, or in pulpit, but I was lost without my copy.But there is little time for regrets. It doesn't take long to reachany place when that place is holding something fearful for you. I wasbefore the mayor long before I was ready to see him.This mayor wasn't true to type. He was more like a schoolmaster. Verypleasant and concise, with tortoiseshell rims to his glasses and withnone of the ornaments of chain and plush that I had anticipated aspart of the regalia of his office. This was somewhat of a relief.There are lots of men, women and children gathered about. I amintroduced to the children. I am whirled around into the crowd, andwhen I turn back I can't quite make out who is the mayor. There seemsto be a roomful of mayors. Eventually I am dug from behind. I turn. Iam whirled back by friendly or official assistance. Ah, here is themayor.  [Illustration: I am welcomed by the Mayor of Southampton.]I stand bewildered, twirling my thumbs, quite at a loss as to what isexpected of me.The mayor begins. I have been warned that it is going to be veryformal.'Mr. Chaplin, on behalf of the citizens of Southampton--'Nothing like I had anticipated. I am trying to think. Trying to hearprecisely what he says. I think I have him so far. But it is nothinglike I had anticipated. My speech doesn't seem to fit what he issaying. I can't help it. I will use it anyhow, at least as much as Ican recall.It is over. I mumble some inane appreciation. Nothing like I hadwritten, with nary a gesture so laboriously rehearsed.There comes interruptions of excited mothers with their children.'This is my little girl.'I am shaking hands mechanically with everybody. From all sidesautograph albums are being shoved under my nose. Carl is warding themoff, protecting me as much as possible.I am aware that the mayor is still standing there. I am trying tothink of something more to say. All visions of language seem to haveleft me. I find myself mumbling. 'This is nice of you' and 'I am veryglad to meet you all.'Somebody whispers in my ear, 'Say something about the English cinema.''Say a word of welcome to the English.' I try to and can't utter aword, but the same excitement that had bothered me now comes forwardto my aid.The whole thing is bewildering and thrilling and I find that I ampleased with it all.But now strange faces seem to fade out and familiar ones take theirplaces. There is Tom Geraghty, who used to be Doug Fairbanks'sscenario writer. He wrote 'When the Clouds Roll By' and 'TheMollycoddle.' Tom is a great friend of mine and we have spent many apleasant hour in Doug's home in Los Angeles. There is Donald Crisp,who played Battling Burrows in 'Broken Blossoms,' a clubmate in theLos Angeles Athletic Club.My cousin, Aubrey Chaplin, a rather dignified gentleman, but with allthe earmarks of a Chaplin, greets me.Heavens! I look something like him. I picture myself in another fiveyears. Aubrey has a saloon in quite a respectable part of London. Ifeel that Aubrey is a nice simple soul and quite desirous of taking mein hand.Then Abe Breman, manager of the United Artists' affairs in England.And there is 'Sonny,' a friend in the days when I was on the stage. Ihave not heard from him in ten years. It makes me happy andinterested, the thought of reviving the old friendship.We talk of all sorts of subjects. Sonny is prosperous and doing well.He tells me everything in jerky asides, as we are hustled about amidstthe baggage and bundled into a compartment that somebody has arranged.Somehow the crowds here are not so large as I had anticipated. I am alittle shocked. What if they don't turn up? Every one has tried toimpress upon me the size of the reception I am to get. There is atinge of disappointment, but then I am informed that, the boat beinga day late, the crowd expected had no way of knowing when I wouldarrive.This explanation relieves me tremendously, though it is not so muchfor myself that I feel this, but for my companions and my friends, whoexpect so much. I feel that the whole thing should go off with a bangfor their sake. Yes, I do.But I am in England. There is freshness. There is glow. There isNature in its most benevolent mood. The trains, those little toytrains with the funny little wheels like those on a child's toy. Thereare strange noises. They come from the engine--snorting, explosivesounds, as though it was clamoring for attention.I am in another world. Southampton, though I have been there before,is absolutely strange to me. There is nothing familiar. I feel asthough I am in a foreign country. Crowds, increasing with everyminute. What lovely women, different from American women. How, why, Icannot tell.There is a beautiful girl peering at me, a lovely English type. Shecomes to the carriage and in a beautiful, musical voice says, 'May Ihave your signature, Mr. Chaplin?' This is thrilling. Aren't Englishgirls charming? She is just the type you see in pictures, somethinglike Hall Caine's Gloria in _The Christian_--beautiful auburn hair,about seventeen.Seventeen! What an age! I was that once--and here, in England. Itseems very long ago.Tom Geraghty and the bunch, we are all so excited we don't know justwhat to do or how to act. We cannot collect ourselves. Bursting withpent-up questions of years of gathering, overflowing with importantmessages for one another, we are talking about the most commonplacethings. I find that I am not listening to them, nor they to me. I amjust taking it all in, eyes and ears.An English 'bobby.' Everything is different. Taking the tickets. Thewhole thing is upside down. The locking us in our compartment. I lookat the crowds. The same old 'prop' smile is working. They smile. Theycheer. I wave my hat. I feel silly, but it seems that they like it.Will the train never start? I want to see something outside thestation.I want to see the country. They are all saying things. I do not knowwhat they all think of me, my friends. I wish they were not here. Iwould love to be alone so that I could get it all.We are moving. I sit forward as though to make the train go faster. Iwant a sight of Old England. I want more than a sight.Now I see the English country. New houses going up everywhere. Newtypes for labouring men. More new houses. I have never seen OldEngland in such a frenzy of building. The brush fields are ratherburned up. This is something new for England, for it is always sogreen. It is not as green as it used to be. But it is England, and Iam loving every mile of it.I discover that everything is Los Angeles in my compartment, with theexception of my cousin and Sonny. Here I am in the midst of Hollywood.I have travelled six thousand miles to get away from Hollywood. Motionpictures are universal. You can't run away from them. But I am notbothering much, because I am cannily figuring on shaking the whole lotof them after the usual dinner and getting off by myself.And I am getting new thrills every minute. There are people waitingall along the line, at small stations, waiting for the train to pass.I know they are waiting to see me. It's a wonderful sensation--everybodyso affectionate. Gee! I am wondering what's going to happen in London?Aubrey and the bunch are talking about making a strong-arm squadaround me for protection. I intimately feel that it is not going to benecessary. They say: 'Ah, you don't know, my boy. Wait until you getto London.'Secretly, I am hoping it is true. But I have my doubts. Everybody isnice. They suggest that I should sleep awhile, as I look tired. I feelthat I am being pampered and spoiled. But I like it. And they all seemto understand.My cousin interests me. He warns me what to talk about. At first Ifelt a little conscious in his presence. A little sensitive. Hispersonality--how it mixes with my American friends. I sense that I amshocking him with my American points of view.He has not seen me in ten years. I know that I am altered. I sort ofwant to pose before him a little. I want to shock him; no, not exactlyshock him, but surprise him. I find myself deliberately posing andjust for him. I want to be different, and I want him to know that I ama different person. This is having its effect.Aubrey is bewildered. I am sure that he doesn't know me. I feel that Iam not acting according to his schedule. It encourages me.I become radical in my ideas. Against his conservatism. But I ambeginning not to like this performing for him. One feels so conscious.I am wondering whether he will understand. There are lots of otherpeople I have got to meet. I won't be able to devote all my time tohim. I shall have a long talk with Aubrey later and explaineverything. I doze off for a while.But just for a moment. We are coming to the outskirts of London. Ihear nothing, I see nothing, but I know it is so and I awake. Now I amall expectancy. We are entering the suburbs of the city.V.I ARRIVE IN LONDONLondon! There are familiar buildings. This is thrilling. The samebuildings. They have not altered. I expected that England would bealtered. It isn't. It's the same. The same as I left it, in spite ofthe War. I see no change, not even in the manner of the people.There's Doulton's Potteries! And look, there's the Queen's Headpublic-house that my cousin used to own. I point it out to himdecidedly, but he reminds me that he has a much better place now. Nowwe are coming into the Cut. Can it be true? I can see two or threefamiliar stores. This train is going too fast. I want more time withthese discoveries. I find my emotions almost too much for me. I havemore sentiment about the buildings than I have the people.The recognition of these localities! There is a lump rising in mythroat from somewhere. It is something inexplicable. They are there,thank God!If I could only be alone with it all. With it as it is, and with it asI would people it with ghosts of yesterday. I wish these peopleweren't in the compartment. I am afraid of my emotions.The dear old Cut. We are getting into it now. Here we are. There areall conceivable kinds of noises, whistles, etc. Crowds, throngs linedup on the platforms. Here comes a police sergeant looking for aculprit. He looks straight at me. Good Lord! I am going to bearrested! But no, he smiles.A shout, 'There he is!'Previous to this we had made resolutions. 'Don't forget we are all tolock arms, Knoblock, my cousin, Robinson, Geraghty, and myself.'Immediately I get out of the train, however, we somehow getdisorganised and our campaign manoeuvre is lost. Policemen take meby each arm. There are motion-picture men, still-camera men. I see asign announcing that motion pictures of my trip on board ship will beshown that night at a picture theatre. That dogged photographer of theboat must have gotten something in spite of me.I am walking along quite the centre of things. I feel like royalty. Ifind I am smiling. A regular smile. I distinguish distant faces amongthose who crowd about me. There are voices at the end of the platform.'Here he is. He is there, he is. That's him.' My step is lightninggay. I am enjoying each moment. I am in Waterloo Station, London.The policemen are very excited. It is going to be a terrible ordealfor them. Thousands are outside. This also thrills me. Everything isbeyond my expectations. I revel in it secretly. They all stop toapplaud as I come to the gate. Some of them say:'Well done, Charlie.' I wonder if they mean my present stunt betweenthe bobbies. It is too much for me.What have I done? I feel like a cricketer who has made a hundred andis going to the stand. There is real warm affection. Do I deserve evena part of it?A young girl rushes out, breaks the line, makes one leap, and smothersme with a kiss. Thank God, she is pretty. There seem to be othersready to follow her, and I find myself hesitating a bit on my way. Itis a signal. The barriers are broken.They are coming on all sides. Policemen are elbowing and pushing.Girls are shrieking.'Charlie! Charlie! There he is! Good luck to you. Charlie. God blessyou.' Old men, old women, girls, boys, all in one excited thrill. Myfriends are missing. We are fighting our way through the crowd. I donot mind it at all. I am being carried on the crest of a wave.Everybody is working but me. There seems to be no effort. I amenjoying it--lovely.Eventually we get through to the street. It is worse here. 'Hooray!''Here he is!' 'Good luck, Charlie!' 'Well done, Charlie!' 'God blessyou. God love you!' 'Good luck, Charlie!' Bells are ringing.Handkerchiefs are waving. Some are raising their hats. I have lostmine. I am bewildered, at a loss, wondering where it is all leadingto, but I don't care. I love to stay in it.Suddenly there is a terrific crash. Various currents of the crowd arebattling against one another. I find that now I am concerned about myfriends. Where's Tom? Where's So-and-so? Where's Carl? Where's mycousin? I'm asking it all aloud, on all sides, of anyone who willlisten to me. I am answered with smiles.I am being pushed toward an automobile.'Where's my cousin?' Another push.Policemen on all sides. I am pushed and lifted and almost dumped intothe limousine. My hat is thrown in behind me. There are threepolicemen on each side of the car, standing on the running board. Ican't get out. They are telling the chauffeur to drive on. He seems tobe driving right over the people. Occasionally a head, a smiling face,a hand, a hat flashes by the door of the car. I ask and keep asking,'Where's my cousin?'But I regain myself, straighten my clothes, cool off a bit, and lookround. There is a perfect stranger in the limousine with me. I seem totake him for granted for the moment. He is also cut up and bleeding.Evidently he is somebody. He must be on the schedule to do something.He looks bewildered and confused.I say, 'Well--I have missed my cousin.'He says, 'I beg your pardon, I have not been introduced to you.''Do you know where we are going?' I ask.He says, 'No.''Well, what are you doing--Who are you?' I splutter.'No one in particular,' he answers. 'I have been pushed in hereagainst my will. I think it was the second time you cried for yourcousin. One of the cops picked me, but I don't believe there is anyrelationship.'We laugh. That helps. We pull up and he is politely let off at thecorner. As quickly as possible he is shut out. Crowds are around onboth sides, raising their hats English fashion, as though they weremeeting a lady. The mounted policemen leave us. I am left alone withmy thoughts.If I could only do something--solve the unemployment problem or makesome grand gesture--in answer to all this. I look through the windowin the back of the car. There are a string of taxis following behind.In the lead, seated on top of the cab, is a young and pretty girl alldressed in scarlet. She is waving to me as she chases. What a pictureshe makes! I think what good fun it would be to get on top of the cabwith her and race around through the country.I feel like doing something big. What an opportunity for a politicianto say something and do something big! I never felt such affection. Weare going down York Road. I see placards, 'Charlie Arrives.' Crowdsstanding on the corner, all lined up along my way to the hotel. I ambeginning to wonder what it's all about.Am feeling a bit reflective, after all, thinking over what I havedone; it has not been very much. Nothing to call forth all this.'Shoulder Arms' was pretty good, perhaps, but all this clamour over amoving-picture actor!Now we are passing over Westminster Bridge. There are double-deckedstreet cars. There's one marked 'Kennington.'I want to get out and get on it--I want to go to Kennington. Thebridge is so small; I always thought it was much wider. We are held upby traffic. The driver tells the bobby that Charlie Chaplin is inside.There is a change in the expression of the cop.'On your way.'By this time the policemen have dropped off the side of the car andare on their way back. Once more I am a private citizen. I am just abit sad at this. Being a celebrity has its nice points.There is an auto with a motion-picture camera on top of itphotographing our car. I tell the driver to put down the top. Whydidn't we do this before? I wanted to let the people see. It seemed ashame to hide in this way. I wanted to be seen. There are littlecrowds on the street corners again.Ah yes, and Big Ben. It looks so small now. It was so big before Iwent away. We are turning up the Haymarket. People are looking andwaving from their windows. I wave back. Crowded streets. We arenearing the Ritz, where I am to stop.The crowds are much denser here. I am at a loss. I don't know what todo, what to say. I stand up. I wave and bow at them, smile at them,and go through the motions of shaking hands, using my own hands.Should I say something? Can I say anything? I feel the genuineness ofit all, a real warmth. It is very touching. This is almost too muchfor me. I am afraid I am going to make a scene.I stand up. The crowd comes to a hush. It is attentive. They see I amabout to say something. I am surprised at my own voice. I can hear it.It is quite clear and distinct, saying something about its being agreat moment, etc. But tame and stupid as it is, they like it.There is a 'Hooray!' 'Good boy, Charlie!'Now the problem is how am I going to get out of this? The police arethere, pushing and shoving people aside to make way, but they areout-numbered. There are motion-picture cameras, cameras on the steps.The crowds close in. Then I step out. They close in. I am stillsmiling. I try to think of something useful, learned from myexperience at the New York opening of 'The Three Musketeers.' But I amnot much help to my comrades.Then as we approach, the tide comes in toward the gates of the hotel.They have been kept locked to prevent the crowd from demolishing thebuilding. I can see one intrepid motion-picture camera man at the dooras the crowd starts to swarm. He begins to edge in, and startsgrinding his camera frantically as he is lifted into the whirlpool ofhumanity. But he keeps turning, and his camera and himself aregradually turned up to the sky, and his lens is registering nothingbut clouds as he goes down turning--the most honorable fall a cameraman can have, to go down grinding. I wonder if he really got anypictures.In some way my body has been pushed, carried, lifted, and projectedinto the hotel. I can assure you that through no action of mine wasthis accomplished. I am immediately introduced to some Englishnobleman. The air is electric. I feel now I am free. Everybody issmiling. Everybody is interested. I am shown to a suite of rooms.I like the hotel lobby. It is grand. I am raced to my room. There arebouquets of flowers from two or three English friends whom I hadforgotten. There come cards. I want to welcome them all. Do not mindin the least. Am out for the whole day of it. The crowds are outside.The manager presents himself. Everything has been spread to make mystay as happy as possible.The crowd outside is cheering. What is the thing to do? I had bettergo to the window. I raise my hands again. I pantomime, shake handswith myself, throw them kisses. I see a bouquet of roses in the room.I grab it and start tossing the flowers into the crowd. There is a madscramble for the souvenirs. In a moment the chief of police burstsinto my room.'Please, Mr. Chaplin, it is very fine, but don't throw anything. Youwill cause an accident. They will be crushed and killed. Anything butthat, don't throw anything. If you don't mind, kindly refrain fromthrowing anything.' Excitedly he repeats his message over and overagain.Of course I don't mind; the flowers are all gone, anyway. But I amtheatrically concerned. 'Ah, really I am so sorry. Has anythinghappened?' I feel that everything is all right.The rest of my friends arrive all bruised and cut up. Now that theexcitement has died down, what are we going to do? For no reason atall we order a meal. Nobody is hungry. I want to get out again. Wish Icould.I feel that everybody ought to leave immediately. I want to be alone.I want to get out and escape from all crowds. I want to get overLondon, over to Kennington, all by myself. I want to see some familiarsights. Here baskets of fruit keep pouring in, fresh bouquets,presents, trays full of cards, some of them titles, some well-knownnames--all paying their respects. Now I am muddled. I don't know whatto do first. There is too much waiting. I have too much of a choice.But I must get over to Kennington, and to-day. I am nervous,overstrung, tense. Crowds are still outside. I must go again and bowand wave my hands. I am used to it, am doing it mechanically; it hasno effect. Lunch is ordered for everybody. Newspaper men are outside,visitors are outside. I tell Carl to get them to put it off untilto-morrow. He tells them that I am tired, need a rest, for them tocall to-morrow and they will be given an interview.The bishop of something presents his compliments. He is in the roomwhen I arrive. I can't hear what he is saying. I said 'yes, I shall bedelighted.' We sit down to lunch. What a crowd there is eating withme! I am not quite sure I know them all.Everyone is making plans for me. This irritates me. My cousin, TomGeraghty, Knoblock--would I spend two or three days in the country andget a rest? No. I don't want to rest. Will you see somebody? I don'twant to see anybody. I want to be left entirely alone. I've just gotto have my whim.I make a pretence at lunch. I whisper to Carl, 'You explain everythingto them--tell them that I am going out immediately after lunch.' I ammerely taking the lunch to discipline myself.I look out the window. The crowds are still there. What a problem! Howam I going to get out without being recognised? Shall I openly suggestgoing out, so I can get away? I hate disappointing them. But I must goout.Tom Geraghty, Donald Crisp, and myself suggest taking a walk. I donot tell them my plans, merely suggest taking the walk. We go throughthe back way and escape. I am sure that everything is all right, andthat no one will recognise me. I cannot stand the strain any longer. Itell Donald and Tom--they really must leave me alone. I want to bealone, and want to visit alone. They understand. Tom is a good sortand so is Donald. I do not want to ride, but just for a quicker meansof getting away I call a taxicab.I tell him to drive to Lambeth. He is a good driver, and an old one.He has not recognised me, thank heaven!But he is going too fast. I tell him to drive slower, to take histime. I sit back now. I am passing Westminster Bridge again. I see itbetter. Things are more familiar. On the other side is the new LondonCounty Council building. They have been building it for years. Theystarted it before I left.The Westminster Road has become very dilapidated, but perhaps it isbecause I am riding in an automobile. I used to travel across itanother way. It doesn't seem so long ago, either.My God! Look! Under the bridge! There's the old blind man. I stop thedriver and drive back. We pull up outside the Canterbury.'You wait there, or do you want me to pay you off?' He will wait. Iwalk back.There he is, the same old figure, the same old blind man I used to seeas a child of five, with the same old earmuffs, with his back againstthe wall and the same stream of greasy water trickling down the stonebehind his back.The same old clothes, a bit greener with age, and the irregular bushof whiskers coloured almost in a rainbow array, but with a dirty greypredominant.What a symbol from which to count the years that I had been away. Alittle more green to his clothes! A bit more grey in his matted beard!He has that same stark look in his eyes that used to make me sick as achild. Everything exactly the same, only a bit more dilapidated.No. There is a change. The dirty little mat for the unhealthy-lookingpup with the watering eyes that used to be with him--that is gone. Iwould like to hear the story of the missing pup.Did its passing make much difference to the lonely derelict? Was itsending a tragic one, dramatic, or had it just passed out naturally?The old man is laboriously reading the same chapter from his old,greasy, and bethumbed embossed Bible. His lips move, but silently, ashis fingers travel over the letters. I wonder if he gets comfortthere? Or does he need comfort?To me it is all too horrible. He is the personification of poverty atits worst, sunk in that inertia that comes of lost hope. It is tooterrible.V
ISTJ	THE HAUNTS OF MY CHILDHOODI jump into the automobile again and we drive along past ChristChurch. There's Baxter Hall, where we used to see magic-lantern slidesfor a penny. The forerunner of the movie of to-day. I see significancein everything around me. You could get a cup of coffee and a piece ofcake there and see the Crucifixion of Christ all at the same time.We are passing the police station. A drear place to youth. KenningtonRoad is more intimate. It has grown beautiful in its decay. There issomething fascinating about it.Sleepy people seem to be living in the streets more than they used towhen I played there. Kennington Baths, the reason for many a day'shookey. You could go swimming there, second class, for three pence (ifyou brought your own swimming trunks).Through Brook Street to the upper Bohemian quarter, where third-ratemusic-hall artists appear. All the same, a little more decayed,perhaps. And yet it is not just the same.I am seeing it through other eyes. Age trying to look back through theeyes of youth. A common pursuit, though a futile one.It is bringing home to me that I am a different person. It takes theform of art; it is beautiful. I am very impersonal about it. It isanother world, and yet in it I recognise something, as though in adream.We pass the Kennington 'pub,' Kennington Cross, Chester Street, whereI used to sleep. The same, but, like its brother landmarks, a bit moredilapidated. There is the old tub outside the stables where I used towash. The same old tub, a little more twisted.I tell the driver to pull up again. 'Wait a moment.' I do not knowwhy, but I want to get out and walk. An automobile has no place inthis setting. I have no particular place to go. I just walk along downChester Street. Children are playing, lovely children. I see myselfamong them back there in the past. I wonder if any of them will comeback some day and look around enviously at other children.Somehow they seem different from those children with whom I used toplay. Sweeter, more dainty were these little, begrimed kids with theirarms entwined around one another's waists. Others, little girlsmostly, sitting on the doorsteps, with dolls, with sewing, all playingat that universal game of 'mothers.'For some reason I feel choking up. As I pass they look up. Franklyand without embarrassment they look at the stranger with theirbeautiful, kindly eyes. They smile at me. I smile back. Oh, if I couldonly do something for them. These waifs with scarcely any chance atall.Now a woman passes with a can of beer. With a white skirt hangingdown, trailing at the back. She treads on it. There, she has done itagain. I want to shriek with laughter at the joy of being in this sameold familiar Kennington. I love it.It is all so soft, so musical; there is so much affection in thevoices. They seem to talk from their souls. There are the inflectionsthat carry meanings, even if words were not understood. I think ofAmericans and myself. Our speech is hard, monotonous, except whereexcitement makes it more noisy.There is a barber shop where I used to be the lather boy. I wonder ifthe same old barber is still there? I look. No, he is gone. I see twoor three kiddies playing on the porch. Foolish, I give them something.It creates attention. I am about to be discovered.I leap into the taxi again and ride on. We drive around until I haveescaped from the neighbourhood where suspicion has been planted andcome to the beginning of Lambeth Walk. I get out and walk along amongthe crowds.People are shopping. How lovely the cockneys are! How romantic thefigures, how sad, how fascinating! Their lovely eyes. How patient theyare! Nothing conscious about them. No affectation, just themselves,their beautifully gay selves, serene in their limitations, perfect intheir type.I am the wrong note in this picture that nature has concentrated here.My clothes are a bit conspicuous in this setting, no matter howunobtrusive my thoughts and actions. Dressed as I am, one neverstrolls along Lambeth Walk.I feel the attention I am attracting. I put my handkerchief to myface. People are looking at me, at first slyly, then insistently. Whoam I? For a moment I am caught unawares.A girl comes up--thin, narrow-chested, but with an eagerness in hereyes that lifts her above any physical defects.'Charlie, don't you know me?'Of course I know her. She is all excited, out of breath. I can almostfeel her heart thumping with emotion as her narrow chest heaves withher hurried breathing. Her face is ghastly white, a girl abouttwenty-eight. She has a little girl with her.This girl was a little servant girl who used to wait on us at thecheap lodging-house where I lived. I remembered that she had left indisgrace. There was tragedy in it. But I could detect a certain savagegloriousness in her. She was carrying on with all odds against her.Hers is the supreme battle of our age. May she and all others of herkind meet a kindly fate.With pent-up feelings we talk about the most commonplace things.'Well, how are you, Charlie?''Fine.' I point to the little girl. 'Is she your little girl?'She says, 'Yes.'That's all, but there doesn't seem to be much need of conversation. Wejust look and smile at each other and we both weave the other's storyhurriedly through our own minds by way of the heart. Perhaps in ourweaving we miss a detail or two, but substantially we are right. Thereis warmth in the renewed acquaintance. I feel that in this moment Iknow her better than I ever did in the many months I used to see herin the old days. And right now I feel that she is worth knowing.There's a crowd gathering. It's come. I am discovered, with no chancefor escape. I give the girl some money to buy something for the child,and hurry on my way. She understands and smiles. Crowds are following.I am discovered in Lambeth Walk.But they are so charming about it. I walk along and they keep behindat an almost standard distance. I can feel rather than hear theirshuffling footsteps as they follow along, getting no closer, losing noground. It reminds me of the Pied Piper of Hamelin.All these people just about five yards away, all timid, thrilled,excited at hearing my name, but not having the courage to shout itunder this spell.'There he is.' 'That's 'im.' All in whispers hoarse with excitementand carrying for great distance, but at the same time repressed bythe effort of whispering. What manners these cockneys have! The crowdsaccumulate. I am getting very much concerned. Sooner or later they aregoing to come up, and I am alone, defenceless. What folly this goingout alone, and along Lambeth Walk!Eventually I see a bobby, a sergeant--or, rather, I think him one, helooks so immaculate in his uniform. I go to him for protection.'Do you mind?' I say. 'I find I have been discovered. I am CharlieChaplin. Would you mind seeing me to a taxi?''That's all right, Charlie. These people won't hurt you. They are thebest people in the world. I have been with them for fifteen years.' Hespeaks with a conviction that makes me feel silly and deservedlyrebuked.I say, 'I know it; they are perfectly charming.''That's just it,' he answers. 'They are charming and nice.'They had hesitated to break in upon my solitude, but now, sensing thatI have protection, they speak out.'Hello, Charlie!' 'God bless you, Charlie!' 'Good luck to you, lad!'As each flings his or her greetings they smile and self-consciouslyback away into the group, bringing others to the fore for theirgreeting. All of them have a word--old women, men, children. I amalmost overcome with the sincerity of their welcome.We are moving along and come to a street corner and into KenningtonRoad again. The crowds continue following as though I were theirleader, with nobody daring to approach within a certain radius.The little cockney children circle around me to get a view from allsides.I see myself among them. I, too, had followed celebrities in my timein Kennington. I, too, had pushed, edged, and fought my way to thefront rank of crowds, led by curiosity. They are in rags, the samerags, only more ragged.They are looking into my face and smiling, showing their blackenedteeth. Good God! English children's teeth are terrible! Something canand should be done about it. But their eyes!Soulful eyes with such a wonderful expression. I see a young girlglance slyly at her beau. What a beautiful look she gives him! I findmyself wondering if he is worthy, if he realises the treasure that ishis. What a lovely people!We are waiting. The policeman is busy hailing a taxi. I just standthere self-conscious. Nobody asks any questions. They are content tolook. Their steadfast watching is so impressing. I feel small--like acheat. Their worship does not belong to me. God, if I could only dosomething for all of them!But there are too many--too many. Good impulses so often die beforethis 'too many.'I am in the taxi.'Good-bye, Charlie! God bless you!' I am on my way.The taxi is going up Kennington Road along Kennington Park. KenningtonPark. How depressing Kennington Park is! How depressing to me are allparks! The loneliness of them. One never goes to a park unless one islonesome. And lonesomeness is sad. The symbol of sadness, that's apark.But I am fascinated now with it. I am lonesome and want to be. I wantto commune with myself and the years that are gone. The years thatwere passed in the shadow of this same Kennington Park. I want to siton its benches again in spite of their treacherous bleakness, in spiteof the drabness.But I am in a taxi. And taxis move fast. The park is out of sight. Itsalluring spell is dismissed with its passing. I did not sit on thebench. We are driving toward Kennington Gate.Kennington Gate. That has its memories. Sad, sweet, rapidly recurringmemories.'Twas here, my first appointment with Hetty (Sonny's sister). How Iwas dolled up in my little, tight-fitting frock coat, hat, and cane! Iwas quite the dude as I watched every street car until four o'clockwaiting for Hetty to step off, smiling as she saw me waiting.I get out and stand there for a few moments at Kennington Gate. Mytaxi driver thinks I am mad. But I am forgetting taxi drivers. I amseeing a lad of nineteen, dressed to the pink, with fluttering heart,waiting, waiting for the moment of the day when he and happinesswalked along the road. The road is so alluring now. It beckons foranother walk, and as I hear a street car approaching I turn eagerly,for the moment almost expecting to see the same trim Hetty step off,smiling.The car stops. A couple of men get off. An old woman. Some children.But no Hetty.Hetty is gone. So is the lad with the frock coat and cane.Back into the cab, we drive up Brixton Road. We pass GlenshoreMansions--a more prosperous neighbourhood. Glenshore Mansions, whichmeant a step upward to me, where I had my Turkish carpets and my redlights in the beginning of my prosperity.We pull up at The Horns for a drink. The same Horns. Used to adjointhe saloon bar. It has changed. Its arrangement is different. I do notrecognise the keeper. I feel very much the foreigner now; do not knowwhat to order. I am out of place. There's a barmaid.How strange, this lady with the coiffured hair and neat littleshirtwaist!'What can I do for you, sir?'I am swept off my feet. Impressed. I want to feel very much theforeigner. I find myself acting.'What have you got?'She looks surprised.'Ah, give me ginger beer.' I find myself becoming a little bitaffected. I refuse to understand the money--the shillings and thepence. It is thoroughly explained to me as each piece is countedbefore me. I go over each one separately and then leave it all on thetable.There are two women seated at a near-by table. One is whispering tothe other. I am recognised.'That's 'im; I tell you 'tis.''Ah, get out! And wot would 'e be a-doin' 'ere?'I pretend not to hear, not to notice. But it is too ominous. Suddenlya white funk comes over me and I rush out and into the taxi again.It's closing time for a part of the afternoon. Something different. Iam surprised. It makes me think it is Sunday. Then I learn that it isa new rule in effect since the war.I am driving down Kennington Road again. Passing Kennington Cross.Kennington Cross.It was here that I first discovered music, or where I first learnedits rare beauty, a beauty that has gladdened and haunted me from thatmoment. It all happened one night while I was there, about midnight. Irecall the whole thing so distinctly.I was just a boy, and its beauty was like some sweet mystery. I didnot understand. I only knew I loved it and I became reverent as thesounds carried themselves through my brain _via_ my heart.I suddenly became aware of a harmonica and a clarinet playing a weird,harmonious message. I learned later that it was 'The Honeysuckle andthe Bee.' It was played with such feeling that I became conscious forthe first time of what melody really was. My first awakening to music.I remembered how thrilled I was as the sweet sounds pealed into thenight. I learned the words the next day. How I would love to hear itnow, that same tune, that same way!Conscious of it, yet defiant, I find myself singing the refrain softlyto myself:     You are the honey, honeysuckle. I am the bee;     I'd like to sip the honey, dear, from those red lips. You see     I love you dearie, dearie, and I want you to love me--     You are my honey, honeysuckle. I am your bee.Kennington Cross, where music first entered my soul. Trivial, perhaps,but it was the first time.There are a few stragglers left as I pass on my way along ManchesterBridge at the Prince Road. They are still watching me. I feel thatKennington Road is alive to the fact that I am in it. I am hoping thatthey are feeling that I have come back, not that I am a stranger inthe public eye.I am on my way back. Crossing Westminster Bridge. I enter a new land.I go back to the Haymarket, back to the Ritz to dress for dinner.VI
ISTJ	A JOKE AND STILL ON THE GOIn the evening I dined at the Ritz with Ed. Knoblock, Miss Forrest,and several other friends. The party was a very congenial one and thedinner excellent. It did much to lift me from the depression intowhich the afternoon in Kennington had put me.Following dinner we said 'Good night' to Miss Forrest, and the rest ofus went around to Ed. Knoblock's apartment in the Albany. The Albanyis the most interesting building I have yet visited in London.In a sort of dignified grandeur it stands swathed in an atmosphere oftradition. It breathes the past, and such a past! It has housed menlike Shelley and Edmund Burke and others whose fame is linked closelywith the march of English civilisation.Naturally, the building is very old. Ed.'s apartment commands awonderful view of London. It is beautifully and artisticallyfurnished, its high ceilings, its tapestries, and its old Victorianwindows giving it a quaintness rather startling in this modern age.We had a bit of supper, and about eleven-thirty it began to rain, andlater there was a considerable thunderstorm.Conversation, languishing on general topics, turns to me, the what andwherefore of my coming and going, my impressions, plans, etc. I tellthem as best I can.Knoblock is anxious to get my views on England, on the impression thatLondon has made. We discuss the matter and make comparisons. I feelthat England has acquired a sadness, something that is tragic and atthe same time beautiful.We discuss my arrival. How wonderful it was. The crowds, thereception. Knoblock thinks that it is the apex of my career. I aminclined to agree with him.Whereupon Tom Geraghty comes forward with a startling thought. Tomsuggests that I die immediately. He insists that this is the onlyfitting thing to do, that to live after such a reception and ovationwould be an anti-climax. The artistic thing to do would be to finishoff my career with a spectacular death. Everyone is shocked at hissuggestion. But I agree with Tom that it would be a great climax. Weare all becoming very sentimental; we insist to one another that wemust not think such thoughts, and the like.The lightning is flashing fitfully outside. Knoblock, with aninspiration, gathers all of us, except Tom Geraghty, into a corner andsuggests that on the next flash of lightning, just for a joke, Ipretend to be struck dead, to see what effect it would have on Tom.We make elaborate plans rapidly. Each is assigned to his part in theimpromptu tragedy. We give Tom another drink and start to talkingabout death and kindred things. Then we all comment how the wind isshaking this old building, how its windows rattle and the weird effectthat lightning has on its old tapestries and lonely candlesticks.Surreptitiously, some one has turned out all but one light, but oldTom does not suspect.The atmosphere is perfect for our hoax and several of us who are 'inthe know' feel sort of creepy as we wait for the next flash. I primemyself for the bit of acting.The flash comes, and with it I let forth a horrible shriek, then standup, stiffen, and fall flat on my face. I think I did it rather well,and I am not sure but that others beside Tom were frightened.Tom drops his whisky glass and exclaims: 'My God! It's happened!' andhis voice is sober. But no one pays any attention to him.They all rush to me and I am carried feet first into the bedroom, andthe door closed on poor old Tom, who is trying to follow me in. Tomjust paces the floor, waiting for some one to come from the bedroomand tell him what has happened. He knocks on the door several times,but no one will let him in.  [Illustration: My 'property grin.']Finally, Carl Robinson comes out of the room, looking seriouslyintent, and Tom rushes to him.'For God's sake, Carl, what's wrong?'Carl brushes him aside and makes for the telephone.'Is he--dead?' Tom puts the question huskily and fearfully.Carl pays no attention except: 'Please don't bother me now, Tom. Thisis too serious.' Then he calls on the telephone for the coroner. Thishas such an effect on Geraghty that Knoblock comes forth from thebedroom to pacify him.'I am sure it will be all right,' Knoblock says to Tom, at the sametime looking as though he were trying to keep something secret.Everything is staged perfectly and poor old Tom just stands and looksbewildered, and every few moments tries to break into the bedroom, butis told to stay out, that he is in no condition to be mixing up inanything so serious.The chief of police is called, doctors are urged to rush there in allhaste with motors, and with each call Tom's suffering increases. Wekeep up the joke until it has reached the point of artistry, and thenI enter from the bedroom in a flowing sheet for a gown and a pillowslip on each arm to represent wings, and I proceed to be an angel fora moment.But the effect has been too great on Tom, and even the travesty at thefinish does not get a laugh from him.We laughed and talked about the stunt for a while and Tom was askedwhat he would have done if it had been true and I had been hit by thelightning.Tom made me feel very cheap and sorry that I had played the trick onhim when he said that he would have jumped out of the window himself,as he would have no desire to live if I were dead.But we soon got away from serious things and ended the party merrilyand went home about five in the morning. Which meant that we wouldsleep very late that day.Three o'clock in the afternoon found me awakened by the news thatthere was a delegation of reporters waiting to see me. They were allushered in and the whole thirty-five of them started firing questionsat me in a bunch. And I answered them all, for by this time I wasquite proficient with reporters, and as they all asked the samequestions that I had answered before it was not hard.In fact, we all had luncheon or tea together, though for me it wasbreakfast, and I enjoyed them immensely. They are real, sincere, andintelligent and not hero worshippers.Along about five o'clock Ed. Knoblock came in with the suggestion thatwe go out for a ride together and call around to see Bernard Shaw.This did sound like a real treat. Knoblock knows Shaw very well and hefelt sure that Shaw and I would like each other.First, though, I propose that we take a ride about London, and Ed.leads the way to some very interesting spots, the spots that thetourist rarely sees as he races his way through the buildings listedin guide books.He takes me to the back of the Strand Theatre, where there arebeautiful gardens and courts suggesting palaces and armour and thedays when knights were bold. These houses were the homes of privatepeople during the reign of King Charles and even farther back. Theyabound in secret passages and tunnels leading up to the royal palace.There is an air about them that is aped and copied, but it is not hardto distinguish the real from the imitation. History is written onevery stone; not the history of the battlefield that is laid bare forthe historians, but that more intimate history, that of thedrawing-room, where, after all, the real ashes of empires are sifted.Now we are in Adelphi Terrace, where Bernard Shaw and Sir James Barrielive. What a lovely place the terrace is! And its arches underneathleading to the river. And at this hour, six-thirty, there comes thefirst fall of evening and London with its soft light is at its best.I can quite understand why Whistler was so crazy about it. Itslighting is perfect--so beautiful and soft. Perhaps there are thosewho complain that it is poorly lighted and who would install manymodern torches of electricity to remedy the defect, but give me Londonas it is. Do not paint the lily.We make for Shaw's house, which overlooks the Thames Embankment. As weapproach I feel that this is a momentous occasion. I am to meet Shaw.We reach the house. I notice on the door a little brass name platewith the inscription, 'Bernard Shaw.' I wonder if there is anythingsignificant about Shaw's name being engraved in brass. The thoughtpleases me. But we are here, and Knoblock is about to lift theknocker.And then I seem to remember reading somewhere about dozens of movieactors going abroad, and how they invariably visited Shaw. Good Lord!the man must be weary of them. And why should he be singled out andimposed upon? And I do not desire to ape others. And I want to beindividual and different. And I want Bernard Shaw to like me. And Idon't want to force myself upon him.And all this is occurring very rapidly, and I am getting fussed, andwe are almost before him, and I say to Knoblock, 'No, I don't want tomeet him.'Ed. is annoyed and surprised and thinks I am crazy and everything. Heasks why, and I suddenly become embarrassed and shy. 'Some othertime,' I beg. 'We won't call to-day.' I don't know why, but suddenly Ifeel self-conscious and silly--Would I care to see Barrie? He lives just across the road.'No, I don't want to see any of them to-day.' I am too tired. I findthat it would be too much effort.So I go home, after drinking in all the beauties of the evening, thetwilight, and the loveliness of Adelphi Terrace. This requires noeffort. I can just drift along on my own, let thoughts come and go asthey will, and never have to think about being polite and wondering ifI am holding my own in intelligent discussion that is sure to arisewhen one meets great minds. I wasted the evening just then. Some othertime, I know, I am going to want Shaw and Barrie.I drift along with the sight and am carried back a hundred years, twohundred, a thousand. I seem to see the ghosts of King Charles andothers of Old England with the tombstones epitaphed in Old English anddating back even to the eleventh century.It is all fragrant and too fleeting. We must get back to the hotel todress for dinner.Then Knoblock, Sonny, Geraghty, and a few others dine with me at theEmbassy Club, but Knoblock, who is tired, leaves after dinner. Alongabout ten o'clock Sonny, Geraghty, Donald Crist, Carl Robinson, andmyself decide to take a ride. We make toward Lambeth. I want to showthem Lambeth. I feel as if it is mine--a choice discovery andpossession that I wish to display.I recall an old photographer's shop in the Westminster Bridge Roadjust before you come to the bridge. I want to see it again. We get outthere. I remember having seen a picture framed in that window when Iwas a boy--a picture of Dan Leno, who was an idol of mine in thosedays.The picture was still there, so is the photographer--the name 'Sharp'is still on the shop. I tell my friends that I had my picture takenhere about fifteen years ago, and we went inside to see if we couldget one of the photos.'My name is Chaplin,' I told the person behind the counter. 'Youphotographed me fifteen years ago. I want to buy some copies.''Oh, we destroyed the negative long ago,' the person behind thecounter thus dismisses me.'Have you destroyed Mr. Leno's negative?' I ask him.'No,' was the reply, 'but Mr. Leno is a famous comedian.'Such is fame. Here I had been patting myself on the back, thinking Iwas some pumpkins as a comedian, and my negative destroyed. However,there is balm in Gilead. I tell him I am Charlie Chaplin and he wantsto turn the place upside down to get some new pictures of me; but wehaven't the time, and, besides, I want to get out, because I amhearing suppressed snickers from my friends, before whom I was goingto show off.VII
ISTJ	A MEMORABLE NIGHT IN LONDONSo we wandered along through South London by Kennington Cross andKennington Gate, Newington Butts, Lambeth Walk, and the Clapham Road,and all through the neighbourhood. Almost every step brought backmemories, most of them of a tender sort. I was right here in the midstof my youth, but somehow I seemed apart from it. I felt as though Iwas viewing it under a glass. It could be seen all too plainly, butwhen I reached to touch it it was not there--only the glass could befelt, this glass that had been glazed by the years since I left.If I could only get through the glass and touch the real live thingthat had called me back to London. But I couldn't.A man cannot go back. He thinks he can, but other things have happenedto his life. He has new ideas, new friends, new attachments. Hedoesn't belong to his past, except that the past has, perhaps, mademarks on him.My friends and I continue our stroll--a stroll so pregnant withinterest to me at times that I forget that I have company and wanderalong alone.Who is that old derelict there against the cart? Another landmark. Ilook at him closely. He is the same--only more so. Well do I rememberhim, the old tomato man. I was about twelve when I first saw him, andhe is still here in the same old spot, plying the same old trade,while I--I can picture him as he first appeared to me standing beside his roundcart heaped with tomatoes, his greasy clothes shiny in theirunkemptness, the rather glassy single eye that had looked from oneside of his face staring at nothing in particular, but giving you thefeeling that it was seeing all, the bottled nose with the network ofveins spelling dissipation.I remember how I used to stand around and wait for him to shout hiswares. His method never varied. There was a sudden twitchingconvulsion, and he leaned to one side, trying to straighten out theother as he did so, and then, taking into his one good lung all theair it would stand, he would let forth a clattering, gargling,asthmatic, high-pitched wheeze, a series of sounds which defiedinterpretation.Somewhere in the explosion there could be detected 'ripe tomatoes.'Any other part of his message was lost.And he was still here. Through summer suns and winter snows he hadstood and was standing. Only a bit more decrepit, a bit older, moredyspeptic, his clothes greasier, his shoulder rounder, his one eyerather filmy and not so all-seeing as it once was. And I waited. Buthe did not shout his wares any more. Even the good lung was failing.He just stood there inert in his ageing. And somehow the tomatoes didnot look so good as they once were.We get into a cab and drive back towards Brixton to the Elephant andCastle, where we pull up at a coffee store. The same old London coffeestore, with its bad coffee and tea.There are a few pink-cheeked roues around and a couple of oldderelicts. Then there are a lot of painted ladies, many of them withyoung men and the rest of them looking for young men. Some of theyoung fellows are minus arms and many of them carry various ribbons ofmilitary honour. They are living and eloquent evidence of the War andits effects. There are a number of stragglers. The whole scene to meis depressing. What a sad London this is! People with tired, wornfaces after four years of War!Someone suggests that we go up and see George Fitzmaurice, who livesin Park Lane. There we can get a drink and then go to bed. We jump ina cab and are soon there. What a difference! Park Lane is anotherworld after the Elephant and Castle. Here are the homes of themillionaires and the prosperous.Fitzmaurice is quite a successful moving-picture director. We find alot of friends at his house, and over whiskies-and-sodas we discussour trip. Our trip through Kennington suggests Limehouse, andconversation turns toward that district and Thomas Burke.I get their impressions of Limehouse. It is not as tough as it hasbeen pictured. I rather lost my temper through the discussion.One of those in the party, an actor, spoke very sneeringly of thatromantic district and its people.'Talk about Limehouse nights. I thought they were tough down there.Why, they are like a lot of larks!' said this big-muscled leading man.And then he tells of a visit to the Limehouse district--a visit madesolely for the purpose of finding trouble. How he had read of thetough characters there and how he had decided to go down to find outhow tough they were.'I went right down there into their joints,' he said, 'and told themthat I was looking for somebody that was tough, the tougher thebetter, and I went up to a big mandarin wearing a feather and said:'Give me the toughest you've got. You fellows are supposed to be toughdown here, so let's see how tough you are.' And I couldn't get a riseout of any of them,' he concluded.This was enough for me. It annoyed.I told him that it was very fine for well-fed, over-paid actorsflaunting toughness at these deprived people, who are gentle and niceand, if ever tough, only so because of environment. I asked him justhow tough he would be if he were living the life that some of theseunfortunate families must live. How easy for him, with five meals aday beneath that thrust-out chest with his muscles trained andperfect, trying to start something with these people. Of course theywere not tough, but when it comes to four years of War, when it comesto losing an arm or a leg, then they are tough. But they are not goingaround looking for fights unless there is a reason.It rather broke up the party, but I was feeling so disgusted that Idid not care.We meander along, walking from Park Lane to the Ritz.On our way we are stopped by two or three young girls. They arestamped plainly and there is no subtlety about their 'Hello boys! Youare not going home so early?' They salute us. We wait a moment. Theypause and then wave their hands to us and we beckon them.'How is it you are up so late?' They are plainly embarrassed at thisquestion. Perhaps it has been a long time since they were given thebenefit of the doubt. They are not sure just what to say. We aredifferent. Their usual method of attack or caress does not seem inorder, so they just giggle.Here is life in its elemental rawness. I feel very kindly disposedtoward them, particularly after my bout with the well-fed actor whogot his entertainment from the frailties of others. But it is ratherhard for us to mix. There is a rather awkward silence.Then one of the girls asks if we have a cigarette. Robinson gives thema package, which they share between the three of them. This breaks theice. They feel easier. The meeting is beginning to run along theparliamentary rules that they know.Do we know where they can get a drink?'No.' This is a temporary setback, but they ask if we mind theirwalking along a bit with us. We don't, and we walk along towards theRitz. They are giggling, and before long I am recognised. They areembarrassed.They look down at their shabby little feet where ill-fitting shoes runover at the heels. Their cheap little cotton suits class them even lowin their profession, though their youth is a big factor toward theirpotential rise when they have become hardened and their mentalfaculties have become sharpened in their eternal battles with men.Then men will come to them.Knowing my identity, they are on their good behaviour. No longer arewe prospects. We are true adventure for them this night. Theirintimacy has left them and in its place there appears a reserve whichis attractive even in its awkwardness.The conversation becomes somewhat formal. And we are nearing thehotel, where we must leave them. They are very nice and charming now,and are as timid and reserved as though they had just left a convent.They talk haltingly of the pictures they have seen, shyly telling howthey loved me in 'Shoulder Arms,' while one of them told how she weptwhen she saw 'The Kid' and how she had that night sent some money hometo a little kid brother who was in school and staying there throughher efforts in London.The difference in them seems so marked when they call me Mr. Chaplinand I recall how they had hailed us as 'Hello, boys.' Somehow I ratherresent the change. I wish they would be more intimate in theirconversation. I would like to get their viewpoint. I want to talk tothem freely. They are so much more interesting than most of the peopleI meet.But there is a barrier. Their reserve stays. I told them that I wassure they were tired and gave them cab fare.One of their number speaks for the trio.'Thanks, Mr. Chaplin, very much. I could do with this, really. I wasbroke, honest. Really, this comes in very handy.'They could not quite understand our being nice and sympathetic.They were used to being treated in the jocular way of streetcomradery. Finer qualities came forward under the respectful attentionwe gave them, something rather nice that had been buried beneath theveneer of their trade.Their thanks are profuse, yet awkward. They are not used to givingthanks. They usually pay, and pay dearly, for anything handed them. Webid them 'good night.' They smile and walk away.We watch them for a bit as they go on their way. At first they arestrolling along, chattering about their adventure. Then, as if on asignal, they straighten up as though bracing themselves, and withquickened steps they move toward Piccadilly, where a haze of light isreflected against the murky sky.It is the beacon light from their battleground, and as we follow themwith our eyes these butterflies of the night make for the lights wherethere is laughter and gaiety.As we go along to the Ritz we are all sobered by the encounter withthe three little girls. I think blessed is the ignorance that enablesthem to go on without the mental torture that would come from knowingthe inevitable that awaits them.As we go up the steps of the hotel we see a number of derelictshuddled asleep against the outside of the building, sitting under thearches and doors, men and women, old and young, underfed, deprived,helpless, so much so that the imprint of helplessness is woven intotheir brain and brings on an unconsciousness that is a blessing.We wake them up and hand them each money. 'Here, get yourself a bed.'They are too numbed. They thank us mechanically, accepting what wegive them, but their reaction and thanks are more physical thanmental.There was one old woman about seventy. I gave her something. She wokeup, or stirred in her sleep, took the money without a word ofthanks--took it as though it was her ration from the bread line and nothanks were expected, huddled herself up in a tighter knot thanbefore, and continued her slumber. The inertia of poverty had longsince claimed her.We rang the night bell at the Ritz, for they are not like our Americanhotels, where guests are in the habit of coming in at all hours of thenight. The Ritz closes its doors at midnight, and after that hour youmust ring them.But the night was not quite over. As we were ringing the bell wenoticed a waggon a little way off in the street, with the horseslipping and the driver out behind the waggon with his shoulder to thewheel and urging the horse along with cheery words.We walked to the waggon and found it was loaded with apples and on itsway to the market. The streets were so slippery that the horse couldnot negotiate the hill. I could not help but think how different fromthe usual driver this man was.He did not belay the tired animal with a whip and curse and swear athim in his helplessness. He saw that the animal was up against it, andinstead of beating him he got out and put his shoulder to the wheel,never for the moment doubting that the horse was doing his best.We all went out into the street and put our shoulders against thewaggon along with the driver. He thanked us, and as we finally got themomentum necessary to carry it over the hill he said:'These darn roads are so slippery that the darned horse even can'tpull it.'It was a source of wonder to him that he should come upon somethingtoo much for his horse. And the horse was so well fed and well kept. Icould not help but notice how much better the animal looked than hismaster. The evening was over. I don't know but that the incident ofthe apple waggon was a fitting finale.The next morning for the first time I am made to give my attention tothe mail that has been arriving. We have been obliged to have anotherroom added to our suite in order to have some place in which to keepthe numerous sacks that are being brought to us at all hours.The pile is becoming so mountainous that we are compelled to engagehalf a dozen stenographers just for the purpose of reading andclassifying them.We found that there were 73,000 letters or cards addressed to meduring the first three days in London, and of this number more than28,000 were begging letters--letters begging anywhere from L1 toL100,000.Countless and varied were the reasons set forth. Some were ridiculous.Some were amusing. Some were pathetic. Some were insulting. All ofthem in earnest.I discovered from the mail that there are 671 relatives of mine inEngland that I knew nothing about.The greater part of these were cousins, and they gave very detailedfamily-tree tracings in support of their claims. All of them wished tobe set up in business or to get into the movies.But the cousins did not have a monopoly on the relationships. Therewere brothers and sisters and aunts and uncles, and there were nineclaiming to be my mother, telling wondrous adventure stories about mybeing stolen by gipsies when a baby or being left on doorsteps, untilI began to think my youth had been a very hectic affair. But I did notworry much about these last, as I had left a perfectly good motherback in California, and so far I have been pretty much satisfied withher.There were letters addressed just to Charles Chaplin, some to KingCharles, some to the 'King of Mirth'; on some there was drawn thepicture of a battered derby; some carried a reproduction of my shoesand cane; and in some there was stuck a white feather with thequestion as to what I was doing during the war?Would I visit such and such institutions? Would I appear for such andsuch charity? Would I kick off the football season or attend someparticular Soccer game? Then there were letters of welcome and oneenclosing an iron cross inscribed, 'For your services in the GreatWar,' and 'Where were you when England was fighting?'Then there were others thanking me for happiness given the senders.These came by the thousand. One young soldier sent me four medals hehad gotten during the big war. He said that he was sending thembecause I had never been properly recognised. His part was so smalland mine so big, he said, that he wanted me to have his _Croix deGuerre_, his regimental and other medals.Some of the letters were most interesting. Here are a few samples:     DEAR MR. CHAPLIN,--You are a leader in your line and I am a     leader in mine. Your speciality is moving pictures and custard     pies. My speciality is windmills.     I know more about windmills than any man in the world. I have     studied the winds all over the world and am now in a position     to invent a windmill that will be the standard mill of the     world, and it will be made so it can be adapted to the winds of     the tropics and the winds of the arctic regions.     I am going to let you in on this in an advantageous way. You     have only to furnish the money. I have the brains, and in a few     years I will make you rich and famous. You had better 'phone me     for quick action.     DEAR MR. CHAPLIN,--Won't you please let me have enough money to     send little Oscar to college? Little Oscar is twelve, and the     neighbours all say that he is the brightest little boy they     have ever seen. And he can imitate you so well that we don't     have to go to the movies any more. [This is dangerous. Oscar is     a real competitor, ruining my business.] And so, if you can't     send the little fellow to college, won't you take him in the     movies with you like you did Jackie Coogan?     DEAR MR. CHAPLIN,--My brother is a sailor, and he is the only     man in the world who knows where Capt. Kidd's gold is buried.     He has charts and maps and everything necessary, including a     pick and shovel. But he cannot pay for the boat.     Will you pay for the boat, and half the gold is yours? All you     need do is to say 'yes' to me in a letter, and I will go out     and look for John as he is off somewhere on a bust, being what     you might call a drinking man when ashore. But I am sure that I     can find him, as he and I drink in the same places. Your     shipmate.     DEAR CHARLIE,--Have you ever thought of the money to be made in     peanuts? I know the peanut industry, but I am not telling any     of my business in a letter. If you are interested in becoming a     peanut king, then I'm your man. Just address me as Snapper     Dodge, above address.     DEAR MR. CHAPLIN,--My daughter has been helping me about my     boarding-house now for several years, and I may say that she     understands the art of catering to the public as wishes to stay     in quarters. But she has such high-toned ideas, like as putting     up curtains in the bathroom and such that at times I think she     is too good for the boarding-house business and should be     having her own hotel to run.     If you could see your way to buy a hotel in London or New York     for Drusilla, I am sure that before long your name and     Drusilla's would be linked together all over the world because     of what Drusilla would do to the hotel business. And she would     save money because she could make all the beds and cook     herself, and at nights could invent the touches like what I     have mentioned. Drusilla is waiting for you to call her.     DEAR MR. CHAPLIN,--I am enclosing pawn tickets for Grandma's     false teeth and our silver water pitcher, also a rent bill     showing that our rent was due yesterday. Of course, we would     rather have you pay our rent first, but if you could spare it,     grandma's teeth would be acceptable, and we can't hold our     heads up among the neighbours since father sneaked our silver     pitcher to get some beer.IX.I MEET THE IMMORTALSHere are extracts from a number of letters selected at random from themountain of mail awaiting me at the hotel:'---- wishes Mr. Chaplin a hearty welcome and begs him to give him thehonour of shaving him on Sunday, Sept. 11, any time which he thinkssuitable.'A West End moneylender has forwarded his business card, which states:'Should you require temporary cash accommodation, I am prepared toadvance you L50 to L10,000 on note of hand alone, without fees ordelay. All communications strictly private and confidential.'A man living in Golden Square, W., writes: 'My son, in the endeavourto get a flower thrown by you from the Ritz Hotel, lost his hat, thebill for which I enclose, seven shillings and sixpence.'A Liverpool scalp specialist gathers that Mr. Chaplin is muchconcerned regarding the appearance of grey hairs in his head. 'I claimto be,' he adds, 'the only man in Great Britain who can and doesrestore the colour of grey hair. You may visit Liverpool, and if youwill call I shall be pleased to examine your scalp and give you acandid opinion. If nothing can be done I will state so frankly.''Is there any chance,' writes a woman of Brixton, 'of you requiringfor your films the services of twin small boys nearly four years oldand nearly indistinguishable? An American agent has recently been inthis neighbourhood and secured a contract with two such small girls(twins), which points to at least a demand for such on Americanfilms.'A widow of sixty-two writes: 'I have a half-dozen china teaset of thelate Queen Victoria's diamond jubilee, and it occurred to me that youmight like to possess it. If you would call or allow me to take itanywhere for you to see, I would gladly do so. I have had ittwenty-four years, and would like to raise money on it.'A South London picture dealer writes: 'If ever you should be passingthis way when you are taking your quiet strolls around London, I wouldlike you to drop in and see a picture that I think might interest you.It is the Strand by night, painted by Arthur Grimshaw in 1887. I hopeyou won't think I have taken too much of a liberty--but I knew yourmother when I was in Kate Paradise's troupe, and I think she wouldremember me if ever you were to mention Clara Symonds of that troupe.It is a little link with the past.''DEAR OLD FRIEND,--Some months ago I wrote to you, and no doubt youwill remember me. I was in 'Casey's Court,' and, as you know, we hadMr. Murray for our boss. You have indeed got on well. I myself haveonly this month come home from being in Turkey for eight years. Dearold boy, I should like to see you when you come to London--that is, ifyou do not mind mixing with one of the Casey's Court urchins.'A Sussex mother writes: 'Would you grant a few moments' interview to alittle girl of nine (small for her years) whom I am anxious to starton the films? She has much in her favour, being not only bright andclever, but unusually attractive in appearance, receiving unlimitedattention wherever she goes, as she is really quite out of theordinary.'A disengaged actress writes: 'If you should take a film in England itwould be a great kindness to employ some of the hundreds of actressesout of work now and with no prospects of getting any. A walk-on wouldbe a very welcome change to many of us, to say nothing of a part.'A Somerset man writes: 'A friend of mine has a very old-time spotright here in Somerset, with the peacocks wandering across thewell-kept grounds and three lovely trout ponds, where last night Ibrought home five very fine rainbow trout each weighing aboutone-and-a-half pounds. You will be tired of the crowds. Slip away downto me and I will give you ten days or more of the best time you canget. There will be no side or style, and your oldest clothes will bethe thing.'Another correspondent says: 'My husband and I should consider it anhonour if during your visit to South London you would call and take ahomely cup of tea with us. I read in the paper of your intention tostay at an old-fashioned inn, and should like to recommend the WhiteHorse Inn at Sheen, which, I believe, is the oldest in Surrey. Itcertainly corresponds with your ideal. Welcome to your home town.'This from the seaside: 'When you are really tired of the rush ofLondon there is a very nice little place called Seaford, not very farfrom London, just a small place where you can have a real rest. Nodressing up, etc., and then fishing, golf, and tennis if you care forthe same. You could put up at an hotel or here. There will be no oneto worry you. Don't forget to drop us a line.'A London clubman, in offering hospitality, says: 'I do not know you.You do not know me, and probably don't want to. But just think it overand come and have a bit of lunch with me one day. This betweenourselves--no publicity.''Saint Pancras Municipal Officers' Swimming Club would be greatlyhonoured by your presiding at our annual swimming gala to be held atthe St. Pancras Public Baths.'Dorothy, writing from Poplar, asks: 'Dear Mr. Charlie Chaplin, if youhave a pair of old boots at home will you throw them at me for luck?'An aspirant for the position of secretary writes: 'I am a musicalcomedy artist by profession, but am at present out of work. I am sixfeet two inches in height and 27 years of age. If there is anycapacity in which you can use my services I shall be very thankful.Hoping you will have an enjoyable stay in your home country.'A Barnes man writes: 'If you have time we should be very proud if youcould spare an afternoon to come to tea. We should love to give you areal old-fashioned Scotch tea, if you would care to come. We know youwill be feted, and everyone will want you, but if you feel tired andwant a wee rest come out quietly to us. If it wasn't for your dearfunny ways on the screen during the war we would all have gone under.''Dear Charles,' writes an eleven-year-old, 'I'd like to meet you very,very much. I'd like to meet you just to say thank you for all thetimes you've cheered me up when I've felt down and miserable. I'venever met you and I don't suppose I ever will, but you will always bemy friend and helper. I'd love your photograph signed by you! Are youlikely to come to Harrogate? I wish you would. Perhaps you could comeand see me. Couldn't you try?'I wish I could read them all, for in every one there is human feeling,and I wish it were possible that I could accept some of theinvitations, especially those inviting me to quietness and solitude.But there are thousands too many. Most of them will have to beanswered by my secretaries, but all of them will be answered, and weare taking trunkfuls of the letters back to California in order thatas many of the requests as possible shall receive attention.During the afternoon there came Donald Crisp, Tom Geraghty and thebunch, and before long my apartment in the London Ritz might just aswell be home in Los Angeles. I realise that I am getting nowhere,meeting nobody and still playing in Hollywood.I have travelled 6,000 miles and find I have not shaken the dust ofHollywood from my shoes. I resent this. I tell Knoblock I must meetother people besides Geraghty and the Hollywood bunch. I have seen asmuch as I want to see of it. Now I want to meet people.Knoblock smiles, but he is too kind to remind me of my retreat beforethe name plate of Bernard Shaw. He and I go shopping and I am measuredfor some clothes; then to lunch with E. V. Lucas.Lucas is a very charming man, sympathetic and sincere. He has writtena number of very good books. It is arranged to give me a party thatnight at the Garrick Club.After luncheon we visit Stoll's Theatre, where 'Shoulder Arms' andMary Pickford's picture 'Suds,' are being shown. This is my firstexperience in an English cinema. The opera house is one that was builtby Steinhouse and then turned into a movie theatre.It is strange and odd to see the English audience drinking tea andeating pastry while watching the performance. I find very littledifference in their appreciation of the picture. All the pointstell just the same as in America. I get out without being recognisedand am very thankful for that.  [Illustration: Another scene from 'Sunnyside,' one of my favourite   photo plays.]Back to the hotel and rest for the evening before my dinner at theGarrick Club.The thought of dining at the Garrick Club brought up before me themental picture that I have always carried of that famous old meetingplace in London, where Art is most dignified. And the club itselfrealised my picture to the fullest.Tradition and custom are so deep-rooted there that I believe itsroutine would go on through sheer mechanics of spirit, even if itsvarious employees should forget to show up some day. The corners seemalmost peopled with the ghosts of Henry Irving and his comrades. Therein one end of the gloomy old room is a chair in which David Garrickhimself sat.All those at the dinner were well known in art circles--E. V. Lucas,Walter Hackett, George Frampton, J. M. Barrie, Herbert Hammil, EdwardKnoblock, Harry Graham, N. Nicholas, Nicholas D. Davies, SquireBancroft, and a number of others whose names I do not remember.What an interesting character is Squire Bancroft. I am told that he isEngland's oldest living actor, and he is now retired. He does not lookas though he should retire.I am late and that adds to an embarrassment which started as soon as Iknew I was to meet Barrie and so many other famous people.There is Barrie. He is pointed out to me just about the time Irecognise him myself. This is my primary reason for coming. To meetBarrie. He is a small man, with a dark moustache and a deeply marked,sad face, with heavily shadowed eyes; but I detect lines of humourlurking around his mouth. Cynical? Not exactly.I catch his eye and make motions for us to sit together, and then findthat the party had been planned that way anyhow. There is theinevitable hush for introductions. How I hate it. Names are the baneof my existence. Personalities, that's the thing.But everyone seems jovial except Barrie. His eyes look sad and tired.But he brightens as though all along there had been that hidden smilebehind the mask. I wonder if they are all friendly toward me, or if Iam just the curiosity of the moment.There is an embarrassing pause, after we have filed into thedining-room, which E. V. Lucas breaks.'Gentlemen, be seated.'I felt almost like a minstrel man and the guests took their seats assimultaneously as though rehearsed for it.I feel very uncomfortable mentally. I cough. What shall I say toBarrie? Why hadn't I given it some thought? I am aware that SquireBancroft is seated at my other side. I feel as though I am in a vicewith its jaws closing as the clock ticks. Why did I come? Theatmosphere is so heavy, yet I am sure they feel most hospitable towardme.I steal a glance at Squire Bancroft. He looks every bit the eminentold-school actor. The dignity and tradition of the English stage iswritten into every line in his face. I remember Nicholson having saidthat the squire would not go to a 'movie,' that he regarded his standas a principle. Then why is he here? He is going to be difficult, Ifear.He breaks the ice with the announcement that he had been to a moviethat day! Coming from him it was almost a shock.'Mr. Chaplin, the reading of the letter in 'Shoulder Arms' was thehigh spot of the picture.' This serious consideration from the man whowould not go to the movies.I wanted to hug him. Then I learn that he had told everyone not to sayanything about his not having been to a movie for fear that it wouldoffend me. He leans over and whispers his age and tells me he is theoldest member of the club. He doesn't look within ten years of hisage. I find myself muttering inanities in answering him.Then Barrie tells me that he is looking for some one to play Peter Panand says he wants me to play it. He bowls me over completely. To thinkthat I was avoiding and afraid to meet such a man! But I am afraid todiscuss it with him seriously, am on my guard because he may decidethat I know nothing about it and change his mind.Just imagine, Barrie has asked me to play Peter Pan! It is too big andgrand to risk spoiling it by some chance witless observation, so Ichange the subject and let this golden opportunity pass. I have failedcompletely in my first skirmish with Barrie.There are laboured jokes going the rounds of the table and everyoneseems to feel conscious of some duty that is resting on his shouldersungracefully.One ruddy gentleman whose occupation is a most serious one, I am told,that of building a giant memorial in Whitehall to the dead of the lateWar, is reacting to the situation most flippantly. His conversation,which has risen to a pitch of almost hysterical volume, is mostridiculously comic. He is a delightful buffoon.Everyone is laughing at his chatter, but nothing seems to bepenetrating my stupidity, though I am carrying with me a widemechanical grin, which I broaden and narrow with the nuances of thetable laughing. I feel utterly out of the picture, that I don'tbelong, that there must be something significant in the badinage thatis bandied about the board.Barrie is speaking again about moving pictures. I must understand. Isummon all of my scattered faculties to bear upon what he is saying.What a peculiarly shaped head he has.He is speaking of 'The Kid,' and I feel that he is trying to flatterme. But how he does it! He is criticising the picture.He is very severe. He declares that the 'heaven' scene was entirelyunnecessary, and why did I give it so much attention? And why so muchof the mother in the picture, and why the meeting of the mother andthe father? All of these things he is discussing analytically andprofoundly, so much so that I find that my feeling of self-consciousnessis rapidly leaving me.I find myself giving my side of the argument without hesitation,because I am not so sure that Barrie is right, and I had reasons, goodreasons, for wanting all those things in the picture. But I amthrilled at his interest and appreciation and it is borne in upon methat by discussing dramatic construction with me he is paying a verygracious and subtle compliment. It is sweet of him. It relieves me ofthe last vestige of my embarrassment.'But, Sir James,' I am saying, 'I cannot agree with you--' Imagine themetamorphosis. And our discussion continues easily and pleasantly. Iam aware of his age as he talks and I get more of his spirit ofwhimsicality.The food is being served and I find that E. V. Lucas has provided atreacle pudding, a particular weakness of mine, to which I do justice.I am wondering if Barrie resents age, he who is so youthful in spirit.There seems to be lots of fun in the general buffoonery that is goingon around the table, but despite all efforts to the contrary I amserving a diet of silence. I feel very colourless, that the wholeconversation that is being shouted is colourless.I am a good audience. I laugh at anything and dare not speak. Whycan't I be witty? Are they trying to draw me out? Maybe I am wrong andthere is a purpose behind this buffoonery. But I hardly know whetherto retaliate in kind, or just grin.I am dying for something to happen. Lucas is rising. We all feel thetension. Why are parties like that? It ends.Barrie is whispering, 'Let's go to my apartment for a drink and aquiet talk,' and I begin to feel that things are most worth while.Knoblock and I walk with him to Adelphi Terrace, where his apartmentoverlooks the Thames Embankment.Somehow this apartment seems just like him, but I cannot convey theresemblance in a description of it. The first thing you see is awriting desk in a huge room beautifully furnished, and with dark-woodpanelling. Simplicity and comfort are written everywhere. There is alarge Dutch fireplace in the right side of the room, but theoutstanding piece of furniture is a tiny kitchen stove in one corner.It is polished to such a point that it takes the aspect of theornamental rather than the useful. He explains that on this he makeshis tea when servants are away. Such a touch, perhaps, just the touchto suggest Barrie.Our talk drifts to the movies and Barrie tells me of the plans forfilming 'Peter Pan.' We are on very friendly ground in this discussionand I find myself giving Barrie ideas for plays while he is giving meideas for movies, many of them suggestions that I can use in comedies.There is a knock at the door. Gerald du Maurier is calling. He is oneof England's greatest actors and the son of the man who wrote'Trilby.' Our party lasts far into the night, until about three in themorning. I notice that Barrie looks rather tired and worn, so weleave, walking with Du Maurier up the Strand. He tells us that Barrieis not himself since his nephew was drowned, that he has agedconsiderably.We walk slowly back to the hotel and to bed.Next day there is a card from Bruce Bairnsfather, England's famouscartoonist, whose work during the war brought him internationalsuccess, inviting me to tea. He carries me out into the country, whereI have a lovely time. His wife tells me that he is just a bundle ofnerves and that he never knows when to stop working. I ask what H. G.Wells is like and Bruce tells me that he is like 'Wells' and no oneelse.When I get back to the hotel there is a letter from Wells.'Do come over. I've just discovered that you are in town. Do you wantto meet Shaw? He is really very charming out of the limelight. Isuppose you are overwhelmed with invitations, but if there is a chanceto get hold of you for a talk, I will be charmed. How about a week-endwith me at Easton, free from publicity and with harmless, humanpeople. No 'phones in the house.'I lost no time in accepting such an invitation.There is a big luncheon party on among my friends and I am told that aparty has been arranged to go through the Limehouse district withThomas Burke, who wrote 'Limehouse Nights.' I resent it exceedinglyand refuse to go with a crowd to meet Burke. I revolt against theconstant crowding. I hate crowds.London and its experiences are telling on me and I am nervous andunstrung. I must see Burke and go with him alone. He is the one manwho sees London through the same kind of glasses as myself.I am told that Burke will be disappointing because he is so silent,but I do not believe that I will be disappointed in him.Robinson tells the crowd of my feelings and how much I have planned onthis night alone with Burke, and the party is called off. We 'phoneBurke and I make an engagement to meet him at his home that evening atten o'clock. We are to spend the night together in Limehouse. What aprospect!That night I was at Thomas Burke's ahead of time. The prospect of anight spent in the Limehouse district with the author of 'LimehouseNights' was as alluring as Christmas morning to a child.Burke is so different from what I expected. 'Limehouse Nights' had ledme to look for some one physically, as well as mentally, big, though Ihad always pictured him as mild-mannered and tremendously human andsympathetic.I notice even as we are introduced that Burke looks tired and it ishard to think that this little man with the thin, peaked face andsensitive features is the same one who has blazed into literature suchelemental lusts, passions and emotions as characterise his shortstories.I am told that he doesn't give out much. I wonder just who he is like.He is very curious. Doesn't seem to be noticing anything that goes onabout him. He just sits with his arm to his face, leaning on his handand gazing into the fire. As he sits there, apparently unperturbed andindifferent, I am warming up to him considerably. I feel a sort ofmaster of the situation. It's a comfortable feeling. Is the reticencereal or is this some wonderful trick of his, this making his guestfeel superior?His tired-looking, sensitive eyes at first seem rather severe andserious, but suddenly I am aware of something keen, quick andtwinkling in them. His wife has arrived. A very young lady of greatcharm, who makes you feel instantly her artistic capabilities even inordinary conversation.Shortly after his wife comes in Burke and I leave, I feeling very muchthe tourist in the hands of the super city guide.'What, where--anything particular that I want to see?'This rather scares me, but I take it as a challenge and make up mymind that I will know him. He is difficult, and, somehow, I don'tbelieve that he cares for movie actors. Maybe I am only possible'copy' to him?He seems to be doing me a kindness and I find myself feeling ratherstiff and on my best behaviour, but I resolve that before the eveningis through I will make him open up and like me, for I am sure that hisinterest is well worth while.I have nothing to suggest except that we ramble along with nothingdeliberate in view. I feel that this pleases him, for a light ofinterest comes into his eyes, chasing one of responsibility. We arejust going to stroll along.X.I MEET THOMAS BURKE AND H. G. WELLSAs Burke and I ramble along toward no place in particular, I talkabout his book. I have read 'Limehouse Nights' as he wrote it. Thereis nothing I could see half so effective. We discuss the fact thatrealities such as he has kept alive seldom happen in a stroll, but Iam satisfied. I don't want to see. It could not be more beautiful thanthe book. There is no reaction to my flattery. I must watch goodtaste. I feel that he is very intelligent, and I am silent for quite awhile as we stroll toward Stepney. There is a greenish mist hangingabout everything and we seem to be in a labyrinth of narrow alleyways,now turning into streets and then merging into squares. He is silentand we merely walk.And then I awaken. I see his purpose. I can do my own story--he ismerely lending me the tools, and what tools they are! I feel that Ihave served an ample apprenticeship in their use, through merelyreading his stories. I am fortified.It is so easy now. He has given me the stories before. Now he istelling them over in pictures. The very shadows take on life andromance. The skulking, strutting, mincing, hurrying forms that pass usand fade out into the night are now becoming characters. The curtainhas risen on 'Limehouse Nights,' dramatised with the original cast.There is a tang of the east in the air and I am tinglingly aware ofsomething vital, living, moving, in this murky atmosphere that is moreintense even for the occasional dim light that peers out into the softgloom from attic windows and storerooms, or municipal lights thatgleam on the street corners.Here is a little slice of God's fashioning, where love runs hand inhand with death, where poetry sings in withered Mongolian hearts, evenas knives are buried in snow-white breasts and swarthy necks. Herehearts are broken casually, but at the same time there comes just asoften to this lotus land the pity, terror, and wonder of first love,and who shall say which is predominant?Behind each of those tiny garret windows lurks life--life in its mostelemental costume. There is no time, thought, or preparation foranything but the elemental passions, and songs of joy, hope, andlaughter are written into each existence, even as the killings go on,surely, swiftly.There must be a magic wand forever doing a pendulum swing over thisland, for the point of view often changes from the beastly to thebeautiful, and in one short moment the innocent frequently gather thesophistication of the aged. These creatures of life's game runblithely along their course ignorant of the past, joyful in thepresent, and careless of the future, while their tiny lightenedwindows seem to wink deliberately as they make pinpricks of lightthrough the shuttered gloom.On the other side of the street there is stepping a little lady whosecheap cotton clothes are cut with Parisian cunning, and as we crossand pass her we discern beauty, enhanced manyfold by youth andvitality, but hardened with premature knowledge. I can't help butthink of little Gracie Goodnight, the little lady who resented thetouch of a 'Chink,' so much so that she filled the fire extinguishersin his place with oil, and when he was trapped in the blazingbuilding, calmly, and with a baby smile upon her face, poured thecontents of the extinguisher over him and his furniture.There is the Queen's Theatre, bringing forward a mental picture oflittle Gina of Chinatown, who stopped a panic in the fire-frightenedaudience of the playhouse as her debut offering on the stage. LittleGina, who brought the whole neighbourhood to her feet in her joyousdancing delight. Little Gina, who at fourteen had lived, laughed, andloved, and who met death with a smile, carrying the secret of him withher.Every once in a while Burke merely lifts his stick and points. Hisgesture needs no comment. He has located and made clear withoutlanguage the only one object he could possibly mean, and, strangely,it is always something particularly interesting to me. He is mostunusual.What a guide he is! He is not showing me Main Street, not the obvious,not even the sightseer's landmarks, but in this rambling I am gettingthe heart, the soul, the feeling. I feel that he has gauged mequickly--that he knows I love feelings rather than details, that he isunconsciously flattering to my subtlety, after two miles throughblack, though lovely, shadows.Now he is picking the spots where lights are shining from the fishshops. He knows their locations, knows their lights because he hasstudied them well. There are forms slinking gracefully, as though onlocation and with rehearsed movement. What an effect for a camera!This is rugged. Here are the robust of the slums. People act morequickly here than in Lambeth. And suddenly we are back where westarted. In a car we go to the old Britannia, Hoxton, ratherreluctantly.There is a glaring moving-picture palace. What a pity! I resent itsobtrusion. We go along toward the East India Docks--to Shadwell. And Iam feeling creepy with the horror of his stories of Shadwell. I couldhear a child screaming behind a shuttered window and I wondered andimagined, but we did not stop anywhere.We meandered along with just an occasional gesture from him, all thatwas necessary to make his point. To Stanhope Road, Bethnal Green,Spitalfields, Ratcliffe, Soho, Notting Dale, and Camden Town.And through it all I have the feeling that things trivial, portentous,beautiful, sordid, cringing, glorious, simple, epochal, hateful,lovable are happening behind closed doors. I people all those shackswith girls, boys, murders, shrieks, life, beauty.As we go back we talk of life in the world outside this adventurousUtopia. He tells me that he has never been outside of London, not evento Paris. This is very curious to me, but it doesn't seem so as hesays it. He tells me of another book that he has ready and of a playthat he is working on for early production. We talked until three inthe morning and I went back to my hotel with the same sort of feelingsthat I had at twelve when I sat up all night reading Stevenson's'Treasure Island.'The next day I did some shopping, and was measured for boots. Howdifferent is shopping here! A graceful ceremony that is pleasing evento a man. The sole advertisement I see in the shop is 'Patronised byHis Majesty.' It is all said in that one phrase.And the same methods have been in vogue at this bootmaker's forcenturies. My foot is placed on a piece of paper and the outlinedrawn. Then measurements are taken of the instep, ankle, and calf, asI want riding boots. Old-fashioned they will probably continue untilthe end of time, yet somehow I sort of felt that if that old shop hada tongue to put in its cheek, there it would be parked, becausetradition, as an aid to the cash register, is no novelty.In the evening I dined at the Embassy Club with Sonny, and was made anhonorary member of the club.It is amazing how much Europe is aping America, particularly with itsdance music. In cafes you hear all the popular airs that are beingplayed on Broadway. The American influence has been felt to such anextent that King Jazz is a universal potentate. Sonny and I go to thetheatre and see a part of the 'League of Notions,' but we leave earlyand I run to say hello to Constance Collier, who is playing in London.The next day is exciting. Through the invitation of a third party I amto meet H. G. Wells at Stoll's office to view the first showing ofWells's picture, 'Kipps.'In the morning the telephone rings and I hear some one in the parloursay that the Prince of Wales is calling. I get in a blue funk, as doeseveryone else in the apartment, and I hear them rush toward the'phone. But Ed. Knoblock claiming to be versed in the proper method ofhandling such a situation, convinces everyone that he is the one to dothe talking and I relapse back into bed, but wider awake than I everwas in my life.Knoblock on the 'phone:'Are you there? ... Yes ... Oh, yes ... to-night ... Thank you.'Knoblock turning from the 'phone announces, very formally, 'The Princeof Wales wishes Charlie to dine with him to-night,' and he startstoward my bedroom door. (Through all of this I have been in thebedroom, and the others are in the parlour confident, with theconfidence of custom, that I am still asleep.)As Knoblock starts for my bedroom door my very American secretary, inthe very routine voice he has trained for such occurrences, says:'Don't wake him. Tell him to call later. Not before two o'clock.'Knoblock: 'Good God man! This is the Prince of Wales,' and he launchesinto a monologue regarding the traditions of England and the customsof Court and what a momentous occasion this is, contemptuouslyobserving that I am in bed and my secretary wants him to tell thePrince to call later! He cannot get the American viewpoint.Knoblock's sincere indignation wins, and the secretary backs away fromthe bedroom as I plunge under the covers and feign sleep. Knoblockcomes in very dignified and, trying to keep his voice in the mostcasual tone, announces, 'Keep to-night open to dine with the Prince ofWales.'I try to enter into it properly, but I feel rather stiff so early inthe morning. I try to remonstrate with him for having made theengagement. I have another engagement with H. G. Wells, but I amthrilled at the thought of dining with the Prince in BuckinghamPalace. I can't do it. What must I do?Knoblock takes me in hand. He repeats the message. I think some one isspoofing and tell him so. I am very suspicious, and the thrill leavesme as I remember that the Prince is in Scotland, shooting. How couldhe get back?But Knoblock is practical. This must go through. And I think he is abit sore at me for my lack of appreciation. He would go to the palacehimself and find out everything. He goes to the palace to verify.I can't tell his part of it--he was very vague--but I gathered thatwhen he reached there he found all the furniture under covers, and Ican hear that butler now saying:'His Royal Highness the Prince will not be back for several days,sir.'Poor Ed.! It was quite a blow for him, and, on the level, I was a bitdisappointed myself.But I lost no time mooning over my lost chance to dine with royalty,for that afternoon I was going to meet Wells. Going to Stoll's; I waseagerly looking forward to a quiet little party where I could get offsomewhere with Wells and have a long talk.  [Illustration: I meet H. G. Wells.]As I drew near the office, however, I noticed crowds, the same sort ofcrowds that I had been dodging since my exit from Los Angeles. It wasa dense mass of humanity packed around the entire front of thebuilding, waiting for something that had been promised them. And thenI knew that it was an arranged affair and that, so far as a chat wasconcerned, Wells and I were just among those present, even though wewere the guests of honour.I remember keenly the crush in the elevator, a tiny little affairbuilt for about six people and carrying nearer sixty. I get theviewpoint of a sardine quite easily. Upstairs it is not so bad, and Iam swept into a room where there are only a few people and the door isthen closed. I look all around, trying to spot Wells. There he is.I notice his beautiful, dark-blue eyes first. Keen and kindly theyare, twinkling just now as though he were inwardly smiling, perhaps atmy very apparent embarrassment.Before we can get together, however, there comes forward the camerabrigade with its flashlight ammunition. Would we pose together? Wellslooks hopeless. I must show that before cameras I am very much of aperson, and I take the initiative with the lens peepers.We are photoed sitting, standing, hats on and off, and in every otherstereotyped position known to camera men.We sign a number of photos, I in my large, sweeping, sprawling hand--Iremember handling the pen in a dashing, swashbuckling manner--thenWells, in his small, hardly discernible style. I am very conscious ofthis difference, and I feel as though I had started to sing aloudbefore a group of grand-opera stars.Then there is a quick-sketch artist for whom we pose. He does his workrapidly, however, and while he is drawing Wells leans over andwhispers in my ear.'We are the goats,' he tells me. 'I was invited here to meet you andyou were probably invited here to meet me.'He had called the turn perfectly, and when we had both accepted theinvitation our double acceptance had been used to make the showing animportant event. I don't think that Wells liked it.Wells and I go into the dark projection room and I sit with Wells. Ifeel on my mettle almost immediately, sitting at his side, and I feelrather glad that we are spending our first moments in an atmospherewhere I am at home. In his presence I feel critical and analytical andI decide to tell the truth about the picture at all costs. I feel thatWells would do the same thing about one of mine.As the picture is reeling off I whisper to him my likes and dislikes,principally the faulty photography, though occasionally I detect baddirection. Wells remains perfectly silent and I begin to feel that Iam not breaking the ice. It is impossible to get acquainted underthese conditions. Thank God, I can keep silent, because there is thepicture to watch and that saves the day.Then Wells whispers, 'Don't you think the boy is good?'The boy in question is right here on the other side of me, watchinghis first picture. I look at him. Just starting out on a new career,vibrant with ambition, eager to make good, and his first attempt beingshown before such an audience. As I watch he is almost in tears,nervous and anxious.The picture ends. There is a mob clustering about. Directors andofficials look at me. They want my opinion of the picture. I shall betruthful. Shall I criticise? Wells nudges me and whispers, 'Saysomething nice about the boy.' And I look at the boy and see whatWells has already seen and then I say the nice things about him.Wells's kindness and consideration mean so much more than a merepicture.Wells is leaving and we are to meet for dinner, and I am left alone towork my way through the crush to the taxi and back to the hotel, whereI snatch a bit of a nap. I want to be in form for Wells.There comes a little message from him:     Don't forget the dinner. You can wrap up in a cloak if you deem     it advisable, and slip in about 7.30 and we can dine in peace.                                                        H. G. WELLS.                                        Whitehall Court, Entrance 4.We talk of Russia and I find no embarrassment in airing my views, butI soon find myself merely the questioner. Wells talks; and, though hesees with the vision of a dreamer, he brings to his views thepractical. As he talks he appears very much like an American. He seemsvery young and full of 'pep.'There is the general feeling that conditions will right themselves insome way. Organisation is needed, he says, and is just as important asdisarmament. Education is the only salvation, not only of Russia, butof the rest of the world. Socialism of the right sort will comethrough proper education. We discuss my prospects of getting intoRussia. I want to see it. Wells tells me that I am at the wrong timeof the year, that the cold weather coming on would make the trip mostinadvisable.I talk about going to Spain, and he seems surprised to hear that Iwant to see a bull fight. He asks, 'Why?'I don't know, except that there is something so nakedly elementalabout it. There is a picturesque technique about it that must appealto any artist. Perhaps Frank Harris's 'Matador' gave me the impulse,together with my perpetual quest for a new experience. He says it istoo cruel to the horses.I relax as the evening goes on and I find that I am liking him evenmore than I expected. About midnight we go out on a balcony just offhis library, and in the light of a full moon we get a gorgeous view ofLondon. Lying before us in the soft, mellow rays of the moon, Londonlooks as though human, and I feel that we are rather in the PeepingTom _role_.I exclaim, 'The indecent moon.'He picks me up. 'That's good. Where did you get that?'I have to admit that it is not original--that it belongs to Knoblock.Wells comments on my dapperness as he helps me on with my coat. 'I seeyou have a cane with you.' I was also wearing a silk hat. I wonderwhat Los Angeles and Hollywood would say if I paraded there in thiscostume?Wells tries on my hat, then takes my cane and twirls it. The effect isridiculous, especially as just at the moment I notice the two volumesof the 'Outline of History' on his table.Strutting stagily, he chants, 'You're quite the fellow doncher know.'We both laugh. Another virtue for Wells. He's human.I try to explain my dress. Tell him that it is my other self, areaction from the everyday Chaplin. I have always desired to looknatty and I have spurts of primness. Everything about me and my workis so sensational that I must get reaction. My dress is a part of it.I feel that it is a poor explanation of the paradox, but Wells thinksotherwise.He says I notice things. That I am an observer and an analyst. I ampleased. I tell him that the only way I notice things is on the run.Whatever keenness of perception I have is momentary, fleeting. Iobserve all in ten minutes or not at all.What a pleasant evening it is! But as I walk along toward the hotel Ifeel that I have not met Wells yet.And I am going to have another opportunity. I am going to have aweek-end with him at his home in Easton, a week-end with Wells athome, with just his family. That alone is worth the entire trip fromLos Angeles to Europe.X
ISTJ	OFF TO FRANCEThe hotel next day is teeming with activity.My secretaries are immersed in mail and, despite the assistance of sixgirls whom they have added temporarily to our forces, the mail bagsare piling up and keeping ahead of us.In a fit of generosity or ennui or something I pitch in and help. Itseems to be the most interesting thing I have attempted on the trip.Why didn't I think of it sooner? Here is drama. Here is life inabundance. Each letter I read brings forth new settings, newcharacters, new problems. I find myself picking out many lettersasking for charity. I lay these aside.I have made up my mind to go to France immediately.I call Carl Robinson. I tell him that we are going to France, toParis, at once. Carl is not surprised. He has been with me for a longtime. We decide that we tell nobody and perhaps we can escapeceremonies. We will keep the apartment at the Ritz and keep thestenographers working, so that callers will think that we are hidingabout London somewhere.We are going to leave on Sunday and our plans are perfected inrapid-fire order. We plunge about in a terrible rush as we try toarrange everything at the last minute without giving the appearance ofarranging anything.And in spite of everything, there is a mob at the station to see usoff and autograph books are thrown at me from all sides. I sign for asmany as I can and upon the others I bestow my 'prop' grin. Wonder if Ilook like Doug when I do this?We meet the skipper. What does one ask skippers? Oh yes, how does itlook to-day for crossing? As I ask, I cast my weather eye out into theChannel and it looks decidedly rough for me.But the skipper's 'just a bit choppy' disarms me.I am eager to get on the boat, and the first person I meet is BaronLong, owner of a hotel in San Diego. Good heavens! Can't I ever getaway from Hollywood? I am glad to see him, but not now. He is veryclever, however. He senses the situation, smiles quick 'hellos,' andthen makes himself scarce. In fact, I think he wanted to get awayhimself. Maybe he was as anxious for a holiday as 
ISTJ	I am approached on the boat by two very charming girls. They want myautograph. Ah, this is nice! I never enjoyed writing my name more.How I wish that I had learned French. I feel hopelessly sunk, becauseafter about three sentences in French I am a total loss so far asconversation is concerned. One girl promises to give me a Frenchlesson. This promises to be a pleasant trip.I am told that in France they call me Charlot. We are by this timestrolling about the boat and bowing every other minute. It is gettingrough and I find myself saying I rather like it that way. Liar.She is speaking. I smile. She smiles. She is talking in French. I amgetting about every eighth word. I cannot seem to concentrate, Frenchis so difficult. Maybe it's the boat.I am dying rapidly. I feel like a dead weight on her arm. I can almostfeel myself get pale as I try to say something, anything. I am weakand perspiring. I blurt out, 'I beg pardon,' and then I rush off to mycabin and lie down. Oh, why did I leave England? Something smellshorrible. I look up. My head is near a new pigskin bag. Yes, that'sit, that awful leathery smell. But I have company. Robinson is in thecabin with me and we are matching ailments.Thus we spent the trip from Dover to Calais and I was as glad to getto the French coast as the Kaiser would have been had he kept thatdinner engagement in Paris.Nearing France, I am almost forgetting my sickness. There is somethingin the atmosphere. Something vibrant. The tempo of life is faster. Thesprings in its mechanism are wound taut. I feel as if I would like totake it apart and look at those springs.I am met by the chief of police, which surprised me, because I wasconfident that I had been canny enough to make a getaway this time.But no. The boat enters the quay and I see the dock crowded withpeople. Some treachery. Hats are waving, kisses are being thrown, andthere are cheers. Cheers that I can only get through the expression,because they are in French and I am notoriously deficient in thatlanguage.'_Vive le Charlot!_' 'Bravo, Charlot!'I am 'Charloted' all over the place. Strange, this foreign tongue.Wonder why a universal language isn't practicable? They are crowdingabout me, asking for autographs. Or at least I think they are, becausethey are pushing books in my face, though for the life of me I can'tmake out a word of their chatter. But I smile. God bless that old'prop' grin, because they seem to like it.Twice I was kissed. I was afraid to look around to see who did it,because I knew I was in France. And you've got to give me the benefitof the doubt. I am hoping that both kisses came from pretty girls,though I do think that at least one of those girls should shave.They examine my signature closely. They seem puzzled. I look. It isspelled right. Oh, I see! They expected 'Charlot.' And I write somemore with 'Charlot.'I am being bundled along to a funny little French train. It seems likea toy. But I am enjoying the difference. Everything is all changed.The new money, the new language, the new faces, the newarchitecture--it's a grown-up three-ring circus to me. The crowd givesa concerted cheer as the train pulls out and a few intrepid ones runalongside until distanced by steam and steel.We go into the dining-room and here is a fresh surprise. The dinner is_table d'hote_ and three waiters are serving it. Everyone is served atonce, and as one man is taking up the soup plates another is servingthe next course. Here is French economy--economy that seems verysensible as they have perfected it. It seems so different fromAmerica, where waiters always seem to be falling over one another indining-rooms. And wines with the meal! And the check; it did notresemble in size the national debt, as dinner checks usually do inAmerica.It has started to rain as we arrive in Paris, which adds to my stateof excitement, and a reportorial avalanche falls upon me. I am aboutovercome. How did reporters know I was coming? The crowd outside thestation is almost as large as the one in London.I am still feeling the effects of my sea-sickness. I am not equal tospeaking nor answering questions. We go to the Customs house and onejournalist, finding us, suggests and points another way out. I amsick. I must disappoint the crowd, and I leap into a taxi and amdriven to Claridge's Hotel.'Out of the frying pan.' Here are more reporters. And they speaknothing but French. The hubbub is awful. We talk to one another. Weshout at one another. We talk slowly. We spell. We do everything tomake Frenchmen understand English, and Englishmen understand French,but it is no use. One of them manages to ask me what I think of Paris.I answer that I never saw so many Frenchmen in my life. I am lookingforward eagerly to meeting Cami, the famous French cartoonist. We havebeen corresponding for several years, he sending me many drawings andI sending him still photos from pictures. We had built up quite afriendship and I have been looking forward to a meeting. I see him.He is coming to me and we are both smiling broadly as we open our armsto each other.'Cami!''Charlot!'Our greeting is most effusive. And then something goes wrong. He istalking in French, a blue streak, with the rapidity of a machine-gun.I can feel my smile fading into blankness. Then I get an inspiration.I start talking in English just as rapidly. Then we both talk at once.It's the old story of the irresistible force and the immovable body.We get nowhere.Then I try talking slowly, extremely slow.'Do--you--understand?'It means nothing. We both realise at the same time what a hopelessthing our interview is. We are sad a bit, then we smile at theabsurdity of it.He is still Cami and I am still Charlot, so we grin and have a goodtime, anyhow.He stays to dinner, which is a hectic meal, for through it all I amtasting this Paris, this Paris that is waiting for me. We go out andto the Folies Bergere. Paris does not seem as light as I expected itto be.And the Folies Bergere seems shabbier. I remember having played hereonce myself with a pantomime act. How grand it looked then. Ratherantiquated now. Somehow it saddened me, this bit of memory that waschased up before me.Next day there is a luncheon with Dudley Field Malone and Waldo Frank.It is a brisk and vivacious meal except when it is broken up by avisit from the American newspaper correspondents.'Mr. Chaplin, why did you come to Europe?''Are you going to Russia?''Did you call on Shaw?'They must have cabled over a set of questions. I went all over thecatechism for them and managed to keep the 'prop' grin at work. Iwouldn't let them spoil Paris for me.We escape after a bit, and back at the hotel I notice an air offormality creeping into the atmosphere as I hear voices in the parlourof my suite. Then my secretary comes in and announces that a veryimportant personage is calling and would speak with me.He enters, an attractive-looking gentleman, and he speaks English.'Mr. Chaplin, that I am to you talk of greetings from the heart of thepeople with France, that you make laugh. Cannot you forego to makeshowing of yourself with charity sometime for devastated France? Onits behalf, I say to you----'I tell him that I will take it up later.He smiles, 'Ah, you are boozy.''Oh, no. I haven't had a drink for several days,' I hasten to informhim. 'I am busy and want to get to bed early to-night.'But Malone butts in with, 'Oh yes, he's very boozy.'And I get a bit indignant until Malone tells me that the Frenchmanmeans 'busy.'Then I am told that there is one young journalist still waiting whohas been here all day, refusing to go until I have seen him.I tell them to bring him in. He comes in smiling in triumph.And he can't speak English.After his hours of waiting we cannot talk.I feel rather sorry for him and we do our best. Finally, with the aidof about everyone in the hotel he manages to ask:--'Do you like France?''Yes,' I answer.He is satisfied.  [Illustration: In Paris with Sir Philip Sassoon and Georges   Carpentier.]Waldo Frank and I sit on a bench in the Champs Elysees and watch thewagons going to market in the early morning. Paris seems mostbeautiful to me just at this time.What a city! What is the force that has made it what it is? Couldanyone conceive such a creation, such a land of continuous gaiety? Itis a masterpiece among cities, the last word in pleasure. Yet I feelthat something has happened to it, something that they are trying tocover by heightened plunges into song and laughter.We stroll along the boulevard and it is growing light. I am recognisedand we are being followed. We are passing a church. There is an oldwoman asleep on the steps, but she does not seem worn and haggard.There is almost a smile on her face as she sleeps. She typifies Paristo me. Hides her poverty behind a smile.Sir Philip Sassoon, who is the confidential secretary to Lloyd George,calls the next day with Georges Carpentier, the pugilistic idol ofFrance, and we are photographed many times, the three of us together,and separately.I am quite surprised that Sir Philip is such a young man. I hadpictured the secretary of Lloyd George as rather a dignified and agedperson. He makes an appointment for me to dine with Lord and LadyRocksavage the next day. Lady Rocksavage is his sister.I also lunch with them the next day, and then to a very fashionablemodiste's for some shopping. This is my first offence of this sort. Imeet Lady Astor, who is shopping there also.It was quite a treat for me, watching the models in this huge,elaborate institution that was really a palace in appointments. Infact, it greatly resembled the palace at Versailles.I felt very meek when tall, suave creatures strolled out and sweptpast me, some imperious, some contemptuous. It was a studied air, butthey did it well. I wonder what effect it has on the girl's mind asshe parades herself before the high-born ladies and gentlemen.But I catch the imperfection in their schooling. It is very amusing towatch them strut about until their display is made, and then, theirstunt done, slouch back into the dressing-rooms _sans_ carriage andmanner.And then, too, I am discovered. This also causes a break in the spellof their queenly stroll. They are laughing and at the same time tryingto maintain the dignity due to the gowns they are wearing. They becomeself-conscious and the effect is ludicrous.I am demoralising the institution, so we get away. I would like totalk to some of the models, but it can't be done very well.From there we go to a candy store, where I lay in a supply ofchocolates and preserved fruits for my trip into Germany the next day.I am invited by Sir Philip to visit him at his country home in Lympne,Kent, on my return from Germany.That evening I go with a party of Dudley Field Malone's to the PalaisRoyale in the Montmartre district. This is a novelty. Different. Seemsseveral steps ahead of America. And it has atmosphere, somethingentirely its own, that you feel so much more than you do the tangiblethings about you.There is a woman wearing a monocle. A simple touch, but how itchanges! The fashions here proclaim themselves even without comparisonand expert opinion.The music is simple, exotic, neurotic. Its simplicity demandsattention. It reaches inside you instead of affecting your feet.They are dancing a tango. It is entertainment just to watch them. Thepauses in the music, its dreamy cadences, its insinuation, itssuggestiveness, its whining, almost monotonous swing. It is tropicalyet, this Paris. And I realise that Paris is at a high pitch. Parishas not yet had relief from the cloddy numbness brought on with theWar. I wonder will relief come easily or will there be aconflagration.I meet Doughie, the correspondent. We recall our first meeting in thekitchen of Christine's in Greenwich Village.It is soon noised about that I am here and our table takes on theatmosphere of a reception. What a medley!Strangely garbed artists, long-haired poets, news-sheet and flowervendors, sightseers, students, children, and cocottes. Presently camea friend whom it was good to see again and we fix up a bit of a partyand get into Dudley's petrol wagon, and as we bowl along we singsongs, ancient songs of the music-halls. 'After the Ball,' 'The ManThat Broke the Bank of Monte Carlo,' and many another which I had notthought of in years.Presently the wagon becomes balky and will not continue. So we allpile out and into a tavern near by, where we call for wine.And Dudley played upon the tin-pan-sounding piano. There came one, atall, strange, pale youth, who asked if we would like to go to thehaunt of the Agile Rabbit. Thence uphill and into a cavernous place.When the patron came the youth ordered wine for us. Somehow I think hesensed the fact that I wanted to remain incognito.The patron was such a perfect host. Ancient and white bearded, heserved us with a finesse that was pure artistry. Then at his commandone named Rene Chedecal, with a sad, haunted face, played upon theviolin.That little house sheltered music that night. He played as if from hissoul, a message--yearning, passionate, sad, gay, and we werespeechless before the emotional beauty and mystery of it.I was overcome. I wanted to express my appreciation, but could do nomore than grasp his hand. Genius breeds in strange places and humble.And then the bearded one sang a song that he said the followers ofLafayette had sung before they left France for America. And all of usjoined in the chorus, singing lustily.Then a young chap did two songs from Verlaine, and a poet withconsiderable skill recited from his own poems. How effective for thecreator of a thought to interpret it. And afterward the violin playergave us another selection of great beauty, one of his owncompositions.Then the old patron asked me to put my name in his ledger, whichcontained many names of both humble and famous. I drew a picture of myhat, cane, and boots, which is my favourite autograph. I wrote, 'Iwould sooner be a gipsy than a movie man,' and signed my name.Home in the petrol wagon, which by this time had become manageableagain. An evening of rareness. Beauty, excitement, sadness and contactwith human, lovable personalities.Waldo Frank called the next day, bringing with him Jacques Copeau, oneof the foremost dramatists and actors in France, who manages anddirects in his own theatre. We go to the circus together and I neversaw so many sad-faced clowns. We dine together, and late that night Ihave supper with Copeau's company in a cafe in the Latin Quarter. Itis a gay night, lasting until about three in the morning.Frank and I set out to walk home together, but the section is toofascinating. Along about four o'clock we drift into another cafe,dimly lit but well attended. We sit there for some time, studying thevarious occupants.Over in one corner a young girl has just leaned over and kissed hersailor companion. No one seems to notice. All the girls here seemyoung, but their actions stamp their vocations. Music, stimulating,exotic, and for the dance, is being played. The girls are very muchalive. They are putting their hats on the men's heads.There are three peasant farmer boys, in all probability. They seemvery much embarrassed as three tiny girls, bright-eyed and red-lipped,join them for a drink. I can see fire smouldering in their dull facesin spite of their awkwardness in welcoming the girls.An interesting figure, Corsican, I should say, is very conspicuous. Agentleman by his bearing, debonair and graceful, he looks the verypicture of an impecunious count. He is visiting all the tables in thecafe. At most of them he calls the girls by their first names.He is taking up a collection for the musicians. Everyone iscontributing liberally. With each tinkle of a coin in the hat theCorsican bows elaborately and extends thanks.He finishes the collection.'On with the dance,' he shouts. 'Don't let the music stop,' as herattles the money. Then he puts his hand in his pocket and draws fortha single centime piece. It is very small, but his manner is that of aphilanthropist.'I give something, no matter how small; you notice, ladies andgentlemen, that I give something,' and he drops his coin in the hatand bows.The party progresses rapidly. They have started singing and have hadjust enough drink to make them maudlin. We leave.XI
ISTJ	MY VISIT TO GERMANYThe train to Germany left so late in the evening that it wasimpossible for me to see devastated France even though we passedthrough a considerable portion of it. Our compartment on the train isvery stuffy and smelly and the train service is atrocious, food andsanitary conditions being intolerable after American train service.Again there is a crowd at the station to see me off, but I am ratherenjoying it. A beautiful French girl presents me with a bouquet offlowers with a cute little speech, or at least I suppose it was,because she looked very cute delivering it, and the pouts that thelanguage gave to her red lips were most provocative. She tells me indelicious broken English that I look tired and sad, and I find myselfyielding without a struggle to her suggestion.We arrive at Joumont near the Belgian frontier along about midnight,and, like a message from home, there is a gang of American soldierboys at the station to greet me. And they are not alone, for French,Belgian, and British troops are also waving and cheering. I wanted totalk to the Belgians, and we tried it, but it was no use. What a pity!But one of them had a happy inspiration and saved the day.'Glass of beer, Charlot?'I nod, smiling. And to my surprise they bring me beer, which I lift tomy lips for politeness, and then drink it to the last drop in purepleasure. It is very good beer.There is a group of charming little Belgian girls. They are smiling atme shyly and I so want to say something to them. But I can't. Ah, thebouquet! Each little girl gets a rose and they are delighted.'_Merci, merci_, monsieur.' And they keep 'merciing' and bowing untilthe train pulls out of the station, which emboldens them to join thesoldiers in a cheer.Through an opening between the railroad structures I see a brilliantlighting display. It is universal, this sign. Here is a movie in thistiny village. What a wonderful medium, to reach such an obscure town.On the train I am being told that my pictures have not played inGermany, hence I am practically unknown there. This rather pleases mebecause I feel that I can relax and be away from crowds.Everyone on the train is nice and there is no trouble. Conductorsstruggle with English for my benefit, and the Customs officers makebut little trouble. In fact, we cross the border at three in themorning and I am asleep.Next morning I find a note from the Customs man saying; 'Good luck,Charlie. You were sleeping so soundly that I did not have the heartto wake you for inspection.'Germany is beautiful. Germany belies the war. There are peoplecrowding the fields, tilling the soil, working feverishly all the timeas our train rushes through. Men, women, and children are all at work.They are facing their problem and rebuilding. A great people,perverted for and by a few.The different style of architecture here is interesting. Factories arebeing built everywhere. Surely this isn't conquered territory. I donot see much live stock in the fields. This seems strange.A dining-car has been put on the train and the waiter comes to ourcompartment to let us know that we may eat. Here is a novelty. Aseven-course dinner, with wine, soup, meat, vegetables, salad,dessert, coffee, and bread for twenty-eight cents. This is madepossible by the low rate of exchange.We go to the Adlon Hotel in Berlin and find that hostelry jammed,owing to the auto races which are being run off at this time. Adifferent atmosphere here. It seems hard for me to relax and get thenormal reaction to meeting people. They don't know me here. I havenever been heard of. It interests me and I believe I resent it just abit.I notice how abrupt the Germans are to foreigners, and I detect atinge of bitterness, too. I am wondering about my pictures makingtheir debut here. I question the power of my personality without itsbackground of reputation.I am feeling more restful under this disinterested treatment, butsomehow I wish that my pictures had been shown here. The people at thehotel are very courteous. They have been told that I am the'white-headed boy and quite the guy in my home town.' Their reactionsare amusing. I am not very impressive-looking and they are finding ithard to believe.There is quite a crowd in the lobby and a number of Americans andEnglish. They are not long in finding me, and a number of English,French, and American reporters start making a fuss over me. TheGermans just stand and look on, bewildered.Carl von Weigand comes forward with the offer of the use of his officewhile I am here. The Germans are impressed with all this, but theyshow no enthusiasm. I am accepted in an offhand way as some one ofimportance and they let it go at that.The Scala Theatre, where I spent the evening, is most interesting,though I think a bit antiquated when compared with English andAmerican theatrical progress along the same lines. It seats about fivethousand, mostly on one floor, with a very small balcony. It is of thevariety-music-hall type, showing mostly 'dumb' acts. Acts that do nottalk or sing, like comic jugglers, acrobats, and dancers.I am amused by a German comedian singing a song of about twentyverses, but the audience is enthused and voices its approval at everyverse. During the intermission we have frankfurters and beer, whichare served in the theatre. I notice the crowds. They go to the theatrethere as a family. It is just that type of an affair.I notice the different types of beauty, though beauty is not very muchin evidence here. Here and there are a few pretty girls, but not many.It is interesting to watch the people strolling during theintermission, drinking lager and eating all sorts of food.Leaving the theatre, we visit the Scala Cafe, a sort ofimpressionistic casino. The Scala is one of the largest cafes inBerlin, where the modernist style in architecture has been carried outfully.The walls are deep mottled sea green, shading into light verdigris andemerald, leaning outward at an angle, thereby producing an effect ofcollapse and forward motion. The junction of the walls and the ceilingis broken into irregular slabs of stone, like the strata of a cave.Behind these the lights are hidden, the whole system of illuminationbeing based on reflection.The immense dislocation of the planes and angles of the vault-likeceiling is focused on the central point, the huge silver star orcrystal bursting like an exploding bomb through the roof. The wholeeffect is weird, almost ominous. The shape of the room in its groundplan is itself irregular--the impression is that of a frozencatastrophe. Yet this feeling seems to be in accord with the mood ofrevellers in Germany to-day.From there to the Palais Heinroth, the most expensive place in Berlinand the high spot of night life. It is conspicuous in its brilliance,because Berlin as a city is so badly lighted. At night the streets aredark and gloomy, and it is then that one gets the effect of war anddefeat.At the Heinroth everybody was in evening dress. We weren't. Myappearance did not cause any excitement. We check our hats and coatsand ask for a table. The manager shrugs his shoulders. There is one inthe back, a most obscure part of the room. This brings home forciblythe absence of my reputation. It nettled me. Well, I wanted rest. Thiswas it.We are about to accept humbly the isolated table, when I hear a shriekand I am slapped on the back and there's a yell:'Charlie!'It is Al Kaufman of the Lasky Corporation and manager of the FamousPlayers studio in Berlin.'Come over to our table. Pola Negri wants to meet you.'Again I come into my own. The Germans look on, wondering. I havecreated attention at last. I discover that there is an American jazzband in the place. In the middle of a number they stop playing andshout:'Hooray for Charlie Chaplin!'The proprietor shrugs his shoulders and the band resumes playing. Ilearn that the musicians are former American doughboys. I feel ratherpleased that I have impressed the Germans in the place.In our party were Rita Kaufman, wife of Al, Pola Negri, Carl Robinson,and myself.Pola Negri is really beautiful. She is Polish and really true to thetype. Beautiful jet-black hair, white, even teeth and wonderfulcoloring. I think it such a pity that such coloring does not registeron the screen.She is the centre of attraction here. I am introduced. What a voiceshe has! Her mouth speaks so prettily the German language. Her voicehas a soft, mellow quality, with charming inflections. Offered adrink, she clinks my glass and offers her only English words, 'Jazzboy Charlie.'Language again stumps me. What a pity! But with the aid of a thirdparty we get along famously. Kaufman whispers: 'Charlie, you've made ahit. She just told me that you are charming.''You tell her that she's the loveliest thing I've seen in Europe.'These compliments keep up for some time, and then I ask Kaufman how tosay, 'I think you are divine' in German. He tells me something inGerman and I repeat it to her.She's startled and looks up and slaps my hand.'Naughty boy,' she says.The table roars. I sense that I have been double-crossed by Kaufman.What have I said? But Pola joins in the joke, and there is nocasualty. I learn later that I have said, 'I think you are terrible.'I decided to go home and learn German.As I am going out the proprietor approaches and very formallyaddresses me: 'I beg pardon, sir. I understand that you are a greatman in the United States. Accept my apologies for not knowing, and thegates here are always open to you.' I accept them formally, thoughthrough it all I feel very comic opera. I didn't like the proprietor.I want to go through the German slums. I mention such a trip to aGerman newspaper man. I am told that I am just like every Londoner andNew-Yorker who comes to Berlin for the first time; that I want theWhitechapel district, the Bowery of Berlin, and that there is no suchdistrict. Once upon a time there were hovels in Berlin, but they havelong since disappeared.This to me is a real step toward civilisation.My newspaper friend tells me that he will give me the next best thingto the slums, and we go to Krogel. What a picture could be made here!I am fascinated as I wander through houses mounted on shaky stilts andcourts ancient but cleanly.Then we drove to Acker Street and gazed into courts and basements. Ina cafe we talked to men and women and drank beer. I almost launched anew war when, wishing to pay a charge of one hundred and eighty marks,I pulled from my pocket a roll of fifty one-thousand-mark notes.My friend paid the check quickly with small change and hustled me out,telling me of the hard faces and criminal types who were watching.He's probably right, but I love those poor, humble people.We drove to the arbor colonies in the northern part of the city,stopping at some of the arbors to talk to the people. I feel that Iwould like to eat dinner here among these people, but I haven'tsufficient courage to persuade my companion, who wouldn't think of it.Passing through the northern part of Berlin, I found many beautieswhich, my friend let me know, were not considered beautiful at all.He even suggested that he show me something in contrast with all I hadseen. I told him no, that it would spoil my whole viewpoint.It has been rather a restful experience, going through the whole townwithout being recognised, but even as I am thinking it a fashionablelady and her young daughter pass, and by their smiles I know that I amagain discovered.And then we meet Fritz Kreisler and his wife, who are just leaving forMunich. We have quite a chat and then make tentative engagements to becarried out in Los Angeles on his next trip there.I notice that the Germans seem to be scrupulously honest, or maybethis was all the more noticeable to me because of genial andunsuspicious treatment by a taxi driver. We left the cab many timesand were gone as long as half an hour at a time, and out of sight, yethe always waited and never suggested that he be paid beforehand.In the business section we pass many cripples with embittered, sullenlooks on their faces. They look as though they had paid for somethingwhich they hadn't received.We are approached by a legless soldier beggar in a faded Germanuniform. Here was the War's mark. These sights you will find on everyside in Berlin.I am presented with a police card to the Berliner Club, which isevidently a technicality by which the law is circumvented. Berlin isfull of such night-life clubs. They are somewhat like the gatheringsthat Prohibition has brought to America.There are no signs, however, from the outside of any activity, and youare compelled to go up dark passages and suddenly come upon gaily litrooms very similar to Parisian cafes.Dancing and popping corks are the first impression as I enter. We aretaken in hand by two girls and they order drinks for us. The girls arevery nervous. In fact, the whole night-life of this town seems to benervous, neurotic, over-done.The girls dance, but very badly. They do not seem to enjoy it andtreat it as part of the job. They are very much interested in myfriend, who seems to have the money for the party. On these occasionsmy secretary always carries the family roll, and they are paying muchattention to him.I sit here rather moody and quiet, though one of the girls works hardto cheer me up. I hear her asking Robinson what is the matter with me.I smile and become courteous. But, her duty done, she turns again toRobinson.I am piqued. Where is that personality of mine? I have been told manytimes that I have it. But here it is convincingly shown thatpersonality has no chance against 'pursenality.'But I am beginning to get so much attention from my friends that oneof the girls is noticing me. She senses that I am some one important,but she can't quite make it out.'Who is this guy, an English diplomat?' she whispers to Robinson. Hewhispers back that I am a man of considerable importance in thediplomatic service. I smile benevolently and they become moreinterested.I am treating her rather paternally and am feeling philosophical. Iask about her life. What is she doing with it? What ambitions? She isa great reader, she tells me, and likes Schopenhauer and Nietzsche.But she shrugs her shoulders in an indifferent and tragic manner andsays, 'What does it matter about life?''You make it what it is,' she says. 'In your brain alone it exists andeffort is only necessary for physical comfort.' We are becoming closerfriends as she tells me this.But she must have some objective, there must be some dreams of thefuture still alive within her. I am very anxious to know what shereally thinks.I ask her about the defeat of Germany. She becomes discreet at once.Blames it on the Kaiser. She hates war and militarism. That's all Ican get out of her, and it is getting late and we must leave. Herfuture intrigues me, but does not seem to worry her.On the way home we step in at Kaufman's apartment and have quite achat about pictures and things back in Los Angeles. Los Angeles seemsvery far away.I am invited to a formal dinner party for the next evening at the homeof Herr Werthauer, one of the most prominent lawyers in all Europe anda chief of the Kaiser during the war. The occasion for the dinner wasto celebrate the announcement of Werthauer's engagement to his thirdwife.His is a wonderful home in the finest section of Berlin. At the partythere are a number of his personal friends, Pola Negri, Al Kaufman,Mrs. Kaufman, Robinson, and myself.There is a Russian band playing native music all through the dinnerand jazz music is also being dispensed by two orchestras made up ofAmerican doughboys who have been discharged, but have stayed on inGermany.For no reason at all, I think of the story of Rasputin. This seems thesort of house for elaborate murders. Perhaps it is the Russian musicthat is having this effect on me. There is a huge marble staircasewhose cold austereness suggests all sorts of things designed to sendchills up the spine. The servants are so impressive and the meal sucha ceremony that I feel that I am in a palace. The Russian folk-songsthat are being dreamily whined from the strings of their peculiarinstruments have a very weird effect and I find food and dining theleast interesting things here.There is a touch of mystery, of the exotic, something so foreignthough intangible, that I find myself searching everything andeverybody, trying to delve deeper into this atmosphere.We are all introduced, but there are too many people for me to try toremember names. There are herrs, fraeuleins, and fraus galore, and Ifind it hard to keep even their sex salutations correct. Some one ismaking a long, formal speech in German, and everybody is watching himattentively.The host arises and offers a toast to his bride-to-be. Everyone risesand drinks to their happiness. The party is very formal and I can makenothing from the talk going on all about me. The host is talking andthen all get up again with their glasses. Why, I don't know, but I getup with them.At this there is general laughter, and I wonder what calamity hasbefallen me. I wonder if my clothes are all right.Then I understand. The host is about to toast me. He does it in verybad English, though his gestures and tone make it most graceful. He isinclined to be somewhat pedantic and whenever he cannot think of theproper English word he uses its German equivalent.As the various courses come the toasts are many. I am always about twobites late in getting to my feet with my glass. After I have beentoasted about four times, Mrs. Kaufman leans over and whispers, 'Youshould toast back again to the host and say something nice about hisbride-to-be.'I am almost gagged with the stage fright that grips me. It is thecustom to toast back to the host and here I have been gulping down allkinds of toasts without a word. And he had been sitting there waitingfor me.I rise and hesitate. 'Mr.--'I feel a kick on the shins and I hear Mrs. Kaufman whisper hoarsely:'Herr.'I think she means the bride-to-be. 'Mrs.--' No, she isn't that yet.Heavens! this is terrible.I plunge in fast and furious. 'My very best respects to your futurewife.' As I speak I look at a young girl at the head of the table whomI thought was the lucky woman. I am all wrong. I sit, conscious ofsome horrible mistake.He bows and thanks me. Mrs. Kaufman scowls and says: 'That's not thewoman. It's the one on the other side.'I have a suppressed convulsion and almost die, and as she points outthe real bride-to-be I find myself laughing hysterically into my soup.Rita Kaufman is laughing with me. Thank heaven for a sense of humour.I am so weak and nervous that I am almost tempted to leave at once.The bride-to-be is reaching for her glass to return my salute, thoughunless she thinks I am cross-eyed I don't see how she knows I saidanything nice to her.But she gets no chance to speak. There is launched a long-windedpedantic speech from the host, who says that on such rare occasions asthis it is customary to uncork the best in the cellar. This point getsover in great shape and everybody is smiling.I even feel myself growing radiant. I was under the impression thatthe best had already been served. Didn't know he was holding backanything. With the promise of better wine I am tempted to try anothertoast to the bride-to-be.XII
ISTJ	I FLY FROM PARIS TO LONDONThe first night in Paris after our return from Germany we dined atPioccardi's, then walked up to the arches of the old gates of Paris.Our intention was to visit the Louvre and see the statue of Venus deMilo, but it only got as far as intention.We drifted into the Montmartre district and stopped in Le Rat Mort,one of its most famous restaurants. As it is very early in theevening, there are very few people about--one reason why I picked outthis place, which later in the night becomes the centre of hecticrevelry.Passing our table is a striking-looking girl with bobbed blond hair,shadowing beautiful, delicate features of pale coloring and soft,strange eyes of a violet blue. Her passing is momentary, but she isthe most striking-looking girl I have seen in Europe.Although there are but few people here, I am soon recognised. TheFrench are so demonstrative. They wave, 'Hello, Charlot!'I am indifferent. I smile mechanically. I am tired. I shall go to bedearly. I order champagne.The bobbed-hair one is sitting at a table near us. She interests me.But she doesn't turn so that I can see her face. She is sitting facingher friend, a dark, Spanish-looking girl.I wish she'd turn. She has a beautiful profile, but I would like tosee her full face again. She looked so lovely when she passed mebefore. I recall that ghost of a smile that hovered near her mouth,showing just a bit of beautiful, even, white teeth.The orchestra is starting and dancers are swinging on to the floor.The two girls rise and join the dance. I will watch closely now andperhaps get another flash at her when she whirls by.There is something refined and distinguished about the little girl.She is different. Doesn't belong here. I am watching her very closely,though she has never once looked my way. I like this touch of theunusual in Montmartre. Still she may be just clever.She is passing me in the dance and I get a full view of her face. Oneof real beauty, with a sensitive mouth, smiling at her friend andgiving a complete view of the beautiful teeth. Her face is mostexpressive. The music stops and they sit at their table.I notice that there is nothing on their table. They are not drinking.This is strange, here. Nor are there sandwiches or coffee. I wonderwho they are. That girl is somebody. I know it.She gets up as the orchestra plays a few strains of a plaintiveRussian thing. She is singing the song. Fascinating! An artist! Why isshe here? I must know her.The song itself is plaintive, elemental, with the insinuating nuancesthat are vital to Russian music. The orchestra, with the violins and'cellos predominant, is playing hauntingly, weaving a foreign exoticspell.She has poise, grace, and is compelling attention even in this place.There comes a bit of melancholy in the song and she sings it as onepossessed, giving it drama, pathos. Suddenly there is a change. Themusic leaps to wild abandon. She is with it. She tosses her head likea wild Hungarian gipsy and gives fire to every note. But almost as itbegan, the abandon is over. With wistful sweetness, she is singingplaintively again.She is touching every human emotion in her song. At times she istossing away care, then gently wooing, an elusive strain that isalmost fairylike, that crescendos into tragedy, going into a crashingclimax that diminishes into an ending, searching yearning, andwistfully sad.Her personality is written into every mood of the song. She is at oncefine, courageous, pathetic, and wild. She finished to an applause thatreflected the indifference of the place. In spots it was spontaneousand insistent. In others little attention was paid to her. She iswasted here.But she cares not. In her face you can see that she gets her applausein the song itself. It was glorious, just to be singing with heart,soul and voice. She smiles faintly, then sits down modestly.I knew it. She is Russian. She has everything to suggest it. Full oftemperament, talent and real emotional ability, hidden away here in LeRat Mort. What a sensation she would be in America with a littleadvertising! This is just a thought, but all sorts of schemes presentthemselves to me.I can see her in 'The Follies' with superb dressing and doing just thesong she had done then. I did not understand a word of it, but I feltevery syllable. Art is universal and needs no language. She haseverything from gentleness to passion and a startling beauty. I amapplauding too much, but she looks and smiles, so I am repaid.They dance again, and while they are gone I call the waiter and havehim explain to the manager that I would like to be presented to her.The manager introduces her and I invite her to my table. She sitsthere with us, while her companion, the dark girl, does a solo dance.She talks charmingly and without restraint. She speaks threelanguages--Russian, French, and English. Her father was a Russiangeneral during the Tsar's reign. I can see now where she gets herimperious carriage.'Are you a Bolshevik?'She flushes as I ask it, and her lips pout prettily as she struggleswith English. She seems all afire.'No, they are wicked. Bolshevik man, he's very bad.' Her eyes flash asshe speaks.'Then you are bourgeoisie?''No, but not a Bolshevik.' Her voice suggests a tremendous vitality,though her vocabulary is limited. 'Bolshevik good idea for the mind,but not for practice.''Has it had a fair opportunity?' I ask her.'Plenty. My father, my mother, my brother all in Russia and very poor.Mother is Bolshevik, father bourgeoisie. Bolshevik man very impudentto me. I want to kill him. He insult me. What can I do? I escape.Bolshevik good idea, but no good for life.''What of Lenin?''Very clever man. He tried hard for Bolshevik--but no good foreverybody--just in the head.'I learn that she was educated in a convent and that she had lost alltrace of her people. She earns her living singing here. She has beento the movies, but has never seen me. She 'is go first chance becauseI am nice man.'I ask her if she would like to go into moving pictures. Her eyes lightup.'If I get opportunity I know I make success. But'--she curls her mouthprettily--'it's difficult to get opportunity.'She is just twenty years old and has been in the cafe for two weeks,coming there from Turkey, to which country she fled following herescape from Russia.I explain that she must have photographic tests made and that I willtry to get her a position in America. She puts everything into hereyes as she thanks me. She looks like a combination of Mary Pickfordand Pola Negri plus her own distinctive beauty and personality. Hername is 'Skaya.' I write her full name and address in my book andpromise to do all I can for her. And I mean to. We say 'Good Night,'and she says she feels that I will do what I say. How has she kepthidden?Due at Sir Philip Sassoon's for a garden party the next day, I decideto go there in an aeroplane and I leave the Le Bourget aerodrome inParis in a plane of La Compagnie des Messageries Aeriennes, and atspecial request the pilot landed me at Lympne in Kent and I therebyavoided the crowd that would have been on hand in London.It was quite thrilling and I felt that I made a very effectiveentrance to the party.And what a delightful retreat! All the charm of an English countryhome, and Sir Philip is a perfect host. I get English food andtreatment. I have a perfect rest, with no duties, and entertainment asI desire it. A day and a half that are most pleasant!  [Illustration: I meet Lady Rocksavage and Sir Philip Sassoon.]Next day there is to be a ceremonial in the schoolhouse, when amemorial is to be unveiled. It is in honour of the boys of thetown who had fallen. There are mothers, fathers, and many old people,some of them old in years, others aged by the trials of the war.The simple affair is most impressive and the streets are crowded onour way. I was to blame for an unhappy contrast. Outside people wereshouting, 'Hooray for Charlie!' while inside souls were hushed ingrief.Such a discordant note. I wished I had not been so prominent. I wantedeveryone to bow in respect to these dead. The crowds did not belongoutside.And inside, on the little children's faces, I could see conflictingemotions. There is the reverence for the dead and yet there iseagerness as they steal glances at me. I wish I hadn't come. I feelthat I am the disturbing element.From the school Sir Philip and I went to the Star and Garter Hospitalfor wounded soldiers. Sheer tragedy was here.Young men suffering from spinal wounds, some of them with legswithered, some suffering from shell shock. No hope for them, yet theysmiled.There was one whose hands were all twisted and he was painting signswith a brush held between his teeth. I looked at the signs. They weremottoes: 'Never Say Die,' 'Are We Downhearted?' A superman.Here is a lad who must take an anaesthetic whenever his nails are cutbecause of his twisted limbs. And he is smiling and to allappearances happy. The capacity that God gives for suffering is sotremendous, I marvel at their endurance.I inquire about food and general conditions. They suggest that thefood could be better. This is attended to.We are received politely and with smiles from the crippled lads whoare crippled in flesh only. Their spirit is boisterous. I feel a punyatom as they shout, 'Good luck to you, Charlie.'I can't talk. There is nothing for me to say. I merely smile and nodand shake hands whenever this is possible. I sign autographs for asmany as ask and I ask them to give me their autographs. I honestlywant them.One jovially says, 'Sure, and Bill will give you one too.' There is anuproar of laughter and Bill laughs just as loud as the rest. Bill hasno arms.But he bests them. He will sign at that. And he does. With his teeth.Such is their spirit. What is to become of them? That is up to you andme.Back to Sir Philip's, very tired and depressed. We dine late and I goto my room and read Waldo Frank's 'Dark Mothers.' The next day thereis tennis and music and in the evening I leave for London, where I amto meet H. G. Wells and go with him to his country home.I am looking forward to this Saturday, Sunday, and Monday as anintellectual holiday. I meet H. G. at Whitehall and he is driving hisown car. He is a very good chauffeur, too.We talk politics and discuss the Irish settlement and I tell him of mytrip to Germany. That leads to a discussion of the depreciation in thevalue of the mark. What will be the outcome? Wells thinks financialcollapse. He thinks that marks issued as they are in Germany will beworthless.I am feeling more intimate and closer to him. There is no strain intalking, though I am still a bit self-conscious and find myselfwatching myself closely.We are out in the country, near Lady Warwick's estate, and H. G. tellsme how the beautiful place is going to seed; that parts of it arebeing divided into lots and sold.The estate, with its live stock, is a show place. It is breeding timefor the deer and from the road we can hear the stags bellowing. H. G.tells me they are dangerous at this time of the year.At the gate of the Wells' estate a young lad of ten greets us with ajovial twinkling of the eye and a brisk manner. There is no mistakinghim. He is H. G.'s son. There is the same moulding of the structureand the same rounded face and eyes. H. G. must have looked that way athis age.'Hello, dad,' as he jumps on the running board.'This is Charlie,' H. G. introduces me.He takes my grip. 'How do?' and I notice what a fine boy he is.Mrs. Wells is a charming little lady with keen, soft eyes that arealways smiling and apparently searching and seeking something. A realgentlewoman, soft voiced, also with humorous lines playing around hermouth.Everyone seems busy taking me into the house, and once there H. G.takes me all over it, to my room, the dining-room, the sitting-roomand, an extra privilege, to his study. 'My workshop,' he calls it.'Here's where the great events in the history of the world tookplace?'He smiles and says 'yes.' The 'Outline of History' was born here.The room is not yet finished, and it is being decorated around thefireplace by paintings made by himself and wife. 'I paint a bit,' heexplains. There is also some tapestry woven by his mother.'Here is a place if you want to escape when the strain is too much foryou. Come here and relax.'I felt that this was his greatest hospitality. But I never used theroom. I had a feeling about that, too.The study is simple and very spare of furniture. There is anold-fashioned desk and I get the general impression of books, but Ican remember but one, the dictionary. Rare observation on my part tonotice nothing but a dictionary, and this was so huge as it stood onhis desk that I couldn't miss it.There is a lovely view from the house of the countryside, with widestretches of land and lovely trees, where deer are roaming aroundunafraid.Mrs. Wells is getting lunch and we have it outdoors. Junior is there,the boy--I call him that already. Their conversation is rapid,flippant. Father and son have a profound analytical discussion aboutthe sting of a wasp as one of the insects buzzed around the table.It is a bit strange to me and I cannot get into the spirit of it,though it is very funny. I just watch and smile. Junior is very witty.He tops his father with jokes, but I sense the fact that H. G. isplaying up to him. There is a twinkle in H. G.'s eye. He is proud ofhis boy. He should be.After lunch we walk about the grounds and I doze most of the afternoonin the summer-house. They leave me alone and I have my nap out.A number of friends arrive later in the evening and we are introducedall around. Most of these are literary, and the discussion is learned.St. John Ervine, the dramatist and author of 'John Ferguson,' came inlater in the evening.Ervine discusses the possibility of synchronising the voice withmotion pictures. He is very much interested. I explain that I don'tthink the voice is necessary, that it spoils the art as much aspainting statuary. I would as soon rouge marble cheeks. Pictures arepantomimic art. We might as well have the stage. There would benothing left to the imagination.Another son comes in. He is more like his mother. We all decide toplay charades and I am selected as one of the actors. I play Orlando,the wrestler, getting a lot of fun through using a coal hod as ahelmet. Then Noah's Ark, with Junior imitating the different animalsgoing into the ark, using walking sticks as horns for a stag, andputting a hat on the end of the stick for a camel, and makingelephants and many other animals through adroit, quick changes. Iplayed old Noah and opened an umbrella and looked at the sky. Then Iwent into the ark and they guessed.Then H. G. Wells did a clog dance, and did it very well. We talked farinto the night, and I marvelled at Wells's vitality. We played manymental guessing games and Junior took all the honours.I was awakened next morning by a chorus outside my door: 'We wantCharlie Chaplin.' This was repeated many times. They had been waitingbreakfast half an hour for me.After breakfast we played a new game of H. G.'s own invention.Everyone was in it and we played it in the barn. It was a combinationof handball and tennis, with rules made by H. G. Very exciting andgood fun.Then a walk to Lady Warwick's estate. As I walk I recall how dramaticit had sounded last night as I was in bed to hear the stags bellowing,evidently their cry of battle.The castle, with beautiful gardens going to seed, seemed very sad,yet its ruins assumed a beauty for me. I liked it better that way.Ruins are majestic.H. G. explains that everyone about is land poor. It takes on afantastic beauty for me, this cultivation of centuries now going toseed, beautiful in its very tragedy.Home for tea, and in the evening I teach them baseball. Here is my onechance to shine. It is funny to see H. G. try to throw a curve andbeing caught at first base after hitting a grounder to the pitcher. H.G. pitched, and his son caught. As a baseball player H. G. is a greatwriter. Dinner that night is perfect, made more enjoyable for ourstrenuous exercise. As I retire that night I think of what a wonderfulholiday I am having.Next day I must leave at 2.30 p.m., but in the morning H. G. and Itake a walk and visit an old country church built in the eleventhcentury. A man is working on a tomb-stone in the churchyard, engravingan epitaph.H. G. points out the influence of the different lords of the manor onthe art changes of different periods. Here the families of LadyWarwick and other notable people are buried. The tombstones show theinfluence of the sculpture of all periods.We go to the top of the church and view the surrounding country andthen back home for lunch. My things are all packed and H. G. and hisson see me off. H. G. reminds me not to forget another engagement todine with him and Chaliapin, the famous Russian baritone.As I speed into town I am wondering if Wells wants to know me orwhether he wants me to know him. I am certain that now I have metWells, really met him, more than I've met anyone in Europe. It's soworth while.XIV.FAREWELLS TO PARIS AND LONDONI had promised to attend the _premiere_ showing of 'The Kid' in Paris,and I went back to the French capital as I came, via aeroplane. Thetrip was uneventful, and on landing and going to my hotel I find amessage from Doug Fairbanks. He and Mary had arrived in Paris and werestopping at the Crillon. They asked me over for a chat but I was tootired. Doug promised to attend the _premiere_ at the TrocaderoTheatre.During the afternoon there came 250 souvenir programmes to beautographed. These were to be sold that night for 100 francs each.In the evening I went to the theatre _via_ the back way, but there wasno escape. It was the biggest demonstration I had yet seen. Forseveral blocks around the crowds were jammed in the streets and thegendarmes had their hands full.Paris had declared a holiday for this occasion, and as the proceeds ofthe entertainment were to be given to the fund for devastated Francethe elite of the country were there. I am introduced to AmbassadorHerrick, then shown to my box and introduced to the Ministers of theFrench Cabinet.I do not attempt to remember names, but the following list has beenpreserved for me by my secretary:M. Menard, who attended on behalf of President Millerand; M.Jusserand, M. Herbette, M. Careron, M. Loucheur, Minister of theLiberated Regions; M. Hermite, Col. and Mrs. H. H. Harjes, Miss HopeHarjes, Mr. and Mrs. Ridgeley Carter, Mrs. Arthur James, Mrs. W. K.Vanderbilt, Mrs. Rutherford Stuyvesant, Walter Berry, M. de Errazu,Marquis de Vallambrosa, Mlle. Cecile Sorel, Robert Hostetter, M.Byron-Kuhn, Mr. and Mrs. Charles G. Loeb, Florence O'Neill, M. HenriLettelier, M. Georges Carpentier, Paul C. Otey, Mr. and Mrs. GeorgeKenneth End, Prince George of Greece, Princess Xenia, PrinceChristopher, Lady Sarah Wilson, Mrs. Elsa Maxwell, Princess Sutzo,Vice-Admiral and Mrs. Albert P. Niblack, Comte and Comtesse Cardelli,Duchess de Talleyrand, Col. and Mrs. N. D. Jay, Col. Bunau Varila,Marquise de Talleyrand-Perigord, Marquis and Marquise de Chambrun,Miss Viola Cross, Miss Elsie De Wolf, Marquis and Marquise deDampierre, and Mr. and Mrs. Theodore Rousseau.My box is draped with American and British flags, and the applause isso insistent that I find I am embarrassed. But there is a delicioustingle to it and I am feeling now what Doug felt when his 'ThreeMusketeers' was shown. The programmes which I autographed during theafternoon are sold immediately and the audience wants more. Iautograph as many more as possible.I am photographed many times and I sit in a daze through most of it,at one time going back stage, though I don't know why, except that Iwas photoed back there too.The picture was shown, but I did not see much of it. There was toomuch to be seen in that audience.At the end of the picture there came a messenger from the Minister:'Would I come to his box and be decorated?' I almost fell out of mybox.I grew sick. What would I say? There was no chance to prepare. I hadvisions of the all-night preparation for my speech in Southampton.This would be infinitely worse. I couldn't even think clearly. Why doI pick out stunts like that? I might have known that something wouldhappen.But the floor would not open up for me to sink through and there wasno one in this friendly audience who could help in my dilemma, and themessenger was waiting politely, though I imagined just a bitimpatiently, so, summoning what courage I had, I went to the box withabout the same feeling as a man approaching the guillotine.I am presented to everybody. He makes a speech. It is translated forme, but very badly. While he was speaking I tried to think ofsomething neat and appropriate, but all my thoughts seemed trite. Ifinally realised that he was finished and I merely said '_Merci_,'which, after all, was about as good as I could have done.And believe me, I meant '_Merci_' both in French and in English.But the applause is continuing. I must say something, so I stand up inthe box and make a speech about the motion-picture industry and tellthem that it is a privilege for us to make a presentation for such acause as that of devastated France.Somehow they liked it, or made me believe they did. There was atremendous demonstration and several bearded men kissed me before Icould get out. But I was blocked in and the crowd wouldn't leave. Atlast the lights were turned out, but still they lingered. Then therecame an old watchman who said he could take us through an unknownpassage that led to the street.We followed him and managed to escape, though there was still atremendous crowd to break through in the street. Outside I meet Cami,who congratulates me, and together we go to the Hotel Crillon to seeDoug and Mary.Mary and Doug are very kind in congratulating me, and I tell them ofmy terrible conduct during the presentation of the decoration. I knewthat I was wholly inadequate for the occasion. I keep mumbling of my_faux pas_ and they try to make me forget my misery by telling me thatGeneral Pershing is in the next room.I'll bet the general never went through a battle like the one I passedthrough that night.Then they wanted to see the decoration, which reminded me that I hadnot yet looked at it myself. So I unrolled the parchment and Doug readaloud the magic words from the Minister of Instruction of the Publicand Beaux Arts which made Charles Chaplin, dramatist, artist, an_Officier de L'instruction Publique_.We sit there until three in the morning, discussing it, and then I goback to my hotel tired but rather happy. That night was worth all thetrip to Europe.At the hotel there was a note from Skaya. She had been to the theatreto see the picture. She sat in the gallery and saw 'The Kid,' takingtime off from her work.Her note:     'I saw picture. You are a grand man. My heart is joy. You must     be happy. I laugh--I cry.                                                           'SKAYA.'This little message was not the least of my pleasures that night.Elsie De Wolf was my hostess at luncheon next day at the VillaTrianon, Versailles, a most interesting and enjoyable occasion, whereI met some of the foremost poets and artists.Returning to Paris, I meet Henry Wales, and we take a trip through theLatin Quarter together. That night I dine with Cami, GeorgesCarpentier, and Henri Letellier. Carpentier asks for an autograph andI draw him a picture of my hat, shoes, cane, and moustache, myimplements of trade. Carpentier, not to be outdone, draws for me ahuge fist encased in a boxing glove.I am due back in England next day to lunch with Sir Philip Sassoon andto meet Lloyd George. Lord and Lady Rocksavage, Lady Diana Manners,and many other prominent people are to be among the guests, and I amlooking forward to the luncheon eagerly.We are going back by aeroplane, though Carl Robinson lets me know thathe prefers some other mode of travel. On this occasion I am nervousand I say frequently that I feel as though something is going tohappen. This does not make a hit with Carl.We figure that by leaving at eight o'clock in the morning we can makeLondon by one o'clock, which will give me plenty of time to keep myengagement.But we hadn't been up long before we were lost in the fog over theChannel and were forced to make a landing on the French coast, causinga delay of two hours. But we finally made it, though I was two hourslate for my engagement, and the thought of keeping Lloyd George andthose other people waiting was ghastly.Our landing in England was made at the Croydon aerodrome, and therewas a big automobile waiting outside, around which were severalhundred people. The aerodrome officials, assuming that the car was forme, hustled me into it and it was driven off.But it was not mine, and I found that I was not being driven to theRitz, but the Majestic Theatre in Clapham.The chauffeur wore a moustache, and, though he looked familiar, I didnot recognise him. But very dramatically he removed the moustache.'I am Castleton Knight. A long time ago you promised me to visit mytheatre. I have concluded that the only way to get you there is tokidnap you. So kindly consider yourself kidnapped.'I couldn't help but laugh, even as I thought of Lloyd George, and Iassured Mr. Knight that he was the first one who had ever kidnappedme. So we went to the theatre, and I stayed an hour and surprised bothmyself and the audience by making a speech.Back to my hotel Sir Philip meets me and tells me that Lloyd Georgecouldn't wait, that he had a most important engagement at fouro'clock. I explained the aeroplane situation to Sir Philip and he wasvery kind. I feel that it was most unfortunate, for it was my onlyopportunity to meet Lloyd George in these times, and I love to meetinteresting personages. I would like to meet Lenin, Trotsky, and theKaiser.This is to be my last night in England, and I have promised to dineand spend the evening with my Cousin Aubrey. One feels dutiful toone's cousin.I also discover that this is the day I am to meet Chaliapin and H. G.Wells. I 'phone H. G. and explain that this is my last day, and of mypromise to my cousin. H. G. is very nice. He understands. You canonly do these things with such people.My cousin calls for me at dusk in a taxi and we ride to his home inBayswater. London is so beautiful at this hour, when the first lightsare being turned on, and each light to me is symbolical. They all meanlife, and I wish sometimes I could peer behind all these lightedwindows.Reaching Aubrey's home I notice a number of people on the other sideof the street standing in the shadows. They must be reporters, Ithink, and am slightly annoyed that they should find me even here. Butmy cousin explains hesitatingly that they are just friends of hiswaiting for a look at me.I feel mean and naughty about this, as I recall that I had requestedhim not to make a party of my visit.I just wanted a family affair, with no visitors, and these simplesouls on the other side of the street were respecting my wishes. Irelent and tell Aubrey to ask them over, anyway. They are all quitenice, simple tradesmen, clerks, etc.Aubrey has a saloon, or at least a hotel, as he calls it, in thevicinity of Bayswater, and later in the evening I suggest that we gothere and take his friends with us. Aubrey is shocked.'No, not around to my place.' Then they all demur. They don't wish tointrude. I like this. Then I insist. They weaken. He weakens.We enter a bar. The place is doing a flourishing business. There are anumber of pictures of my brother Syd and myself all over the walls, incharacter and straight. The place is packed to-night. It must be avery popular resort.'What will you have?' I feel breezy. 'Give the whole saloon a drink.'Aubrey whispers, 'Don't let them know you are here.' He says this forme.But I insist. 'Introduce me to all of them.' I must get him morecustom.He starts quietly whispering to some of his very personal friends:'This is my cousin. Don't say a word.'I speak up rather loudly. 'Give them all a drink.' I feel a bit vulgarto-night. I want to spend money like a drunken sailor. Even thecustomers are shocked. They hardly believe that it's Charlie Chaplin,who always avoids publicity, acting in this vulgar way.I am sure that some of them don't believe despite many assurances. Astunt of my cousin's. But they drink, reverently and with reserve, andthen they bid me good night, and we depart quietly, leaving Bayswateras respectable as ever.To the house for dinner, after which some one brings forth an oldfamily album. It is just like all other family albums.'This is your great-granduncle and that is your great-grandmother.This is Aunt Lucy. This one was a French general.'Aubrey says: 'You know we have quite a good family on your father'sside.' There are pictures of uncles who are very prosperous cattleranchers in South Africa. Wonder why I don't hear from my prosperousrelations.This is the first time that I am aware of my family and I am nowconvinced that we are true aristocrats, blue blood of the first water.Aubrey has children, a boy of twelve, whom I have never met before. Afine boy. I suggest educating him. We talk of it at length and withstress. 'Let's keep up family tradition. He may be a member ofParliament or perhaps President. He's a bright boy.'We dig up all the family and discuss them. The uncles in Spain. Why,we Chaplins have populated the earth.When I came I told Aubrey that I could stay only two hours, but it is4 a.m. and we are still talking. As we leave Aubrey walks with metoward the Ritz.We hail a Ford truck on the way and a rather dandified young Johnny, aformer officer, gives us a lift.'Right you are. Jump on.'A new element, these dandies driving trucks, some of them graduates ofCambridge and Oxford, of good families, most of them, impecuniousaristocrats. Perhaps it is the best thing that could happen to suchfamilies.This chap is very quiet and gentle. He talks mostly of his truck andhis marketing, which he thinks is quite a game. He has been in thegrocery business since the war and has never made so much money. Weget a good bit of his story as we jolt along in the truck.He is providing vegetables and fruit for all his friends in Bayswater,and every morning at four o'clock he is on his way to the market. Heloves the truck. It is so simple to drive.'Half a mo.' He stops talking and pulls up for petrol at a prettylittle white-tiled petrol station. The station is all lit up, thoughit is but 5 a.m.'Good morning. Give me about five gal.''Right-o!'The cheery greeting means more than the simple words that are said.The lad recognises me and greets me frankly, though formally. It seemsso strange to me to hear this truck driver go along conversing in theeasiest possible manner. A truck driver who enjoyed truck driving.He spoke of films for just a bit and then discreetly stopped,thinking, perhaps, that I might not like to talk about them. And,besides, he liked to talk about his truck.He told us how wonderful it was to drive along in the early morningwith only the company of dawn and the stars. He loved the silentstreets, sleeping London. He was enterprising, full of hopes andambitions. Told how he bartered. He knew how. His was a lovelybusiness.He was smoking a pipe and wore a trilby hat, with a sort of frockcoat, and his neck was wrapped in a scarf. I figured him to be aboutthirty years of age.I nudged my cousin. Would he accept anything? We hardly know whetheror not to offer it, though he is going out of his way to drive me tothe Ritz.He has insisted that it is no trouble, that he can cut through toCovent Garden. No trouble. I tell the petrol man to fill it up and Iinsist on paying for the petrol.The lad protests, but I insist.'That's very nice of you, really. But it was a pleasure to have you,'he says, as he gets back in his seat.We cut through to Piccadilly and pull up at the Ritz in a Ford truck.Quite an arrival.The lad bids us good-bye. 'Delighted to have met you. Hope you have abully time. Too bad you are leaving. Bon voyage. Come back in thespring. London is charming then. Well, I must be off. I'm late. Goodmorning.'We talk him over on the steps as he drives away. He is the type of anaristocrat that must live. He is made of the stuff that marks the truearistocrat. He is an inspiration. He talked just enough, never toomuch. The intonation of his voice and his sense of beauty as heappreciated the dawn stamped him as of the elite--the real elite, notthe Blue Book variety.Loving adventure, virtuous, doing something all the time, and lovingthe doing. What an example he is! He has two stores. This is his firsttruck. He loves it. He is the first of his kind that I have met. Thisis my last night in England. I am glad that it brought me this contactwith real nobility.XV.BON VOYAGEI am off in the morning for Southampton, miserable and depressed.Crowds--the same crowds that saw me come--are there. But they seem abit more desirable. I am leaving them. There are so many things I wishI had done. It is pleasant to be getting this applause on my exit.I do not doubt its sincerity now. It is just as fine and as boisterousas it was when I arrived. They were glad to see me come and are sorryI am going.I feel despondent and sad. I want to hug all of them to me. There issomething so wistful about London, about their kind, gentleappreciation. They smile tenderly as I look this way, that way, overthere--on every side it is the same. They are all my friends and I amleaving them.Will I sign this? A few excited ones are shoving autograph books atme, but most of them are under restraint, almost in repose. They feelthe parting. They sense it, but are sending me away with a smile.My car is full of friends going with me to Southampton. They meanlittle at the moment. The crowd has me. Old, old friends turn up,friends that I have been too busy to see. Faithful old friends who arecontent just to get a glimpse before I leave.There's Freddy Whittaker, an old music-hall artist with whom I onceplayed. Just acquaintances, most of them, but they all knew me, andhad all shared, in spirit, my success. All of them are at the stationand all of them understand. They know that my life has been full everyminute I have been here. There had been so much to do.They knew and understood, yet they had come determined just to see me,if only at the door of my carriage. I feel very sad about them.The train is about to pull out and everything is excitement. Everyoneseems emotional and there is a tenseness in the very atmosphere.'Love to Alf and Amy,' many of them whisper, those who know my managerand his wife. I tell them that I am coming back, perhaps next summer.There is applause. 'Don't forget,' they shout. I don't think I couldforget.The trip to Southampton is not enjoyable. There is a sadness on thetrain. A sort of embarrassed sentimentality among my friends. TomGeraghty is along. Tom is an old American and he is all choked up atthe thought of my going back while he has to stay on in England. Weare going back to his land. We cannot talk much.We go to the boat. Sonny is there to see me off. Sonny, Hetty'sbrother.There is luncheon with my friends and there are crowds of reporters. Ican't be annoyed. There is nothing for me to say. I can't even think.We talk, small talk, joke talk.Sonny is very matter-of-fact. I look at him and wonder if he has everknown. He has always been so vague with me. Has always met me in ajoking way.He leans over and whispers, 'I thought you might like this.' It is apackage. I almost know without asking that it is a picture of Hetty. Iam amazed. He understood all the time. Was always alive to thesituation. How England covers up her feelings!Everybody is off the boat but the passengers. My friends stand on thedock and wave to me. I see everything in their glowing faces--loyalty,love, sadness, a few tears. There is a lump in my throat. I smile justas hard as I can to keep them from seeing. I even smile at thereporters. They're darn nice fellows. I wish I knew them better. Afterall, it's their job to ask questions and they have been merely doingtheir job with me. Just doing their jobs, as they see it. That spiritwould make the world if it were universal.England never looked more lovely. Why didn't I go here? Why didn't Ido this and that? There is so much that I missed. I must come backagain. Will they be glad to see me? As glad as I am to see them? Ihope so. My cheek is damp. I turn away and blot out the sadness. I amnot going to look back again.A sweet little girl about eight years of age, full of laughingchildhood, is coming toward me with a bubbling voice. Her very lookcommands me not to try to escape. I don't think I want to escape fromher.'Oh, Mr. Chaplin,' gurgled the little girl, 'I've been looking for youall over the boat. Please adopt me like you did Jackie Coogan. Wecould smash windows together and have lots of fun. I love your plays.'She takes my hand and looks up into my face. 'They are so clever andbeautiful. Won't you teach me like you taught him? He's so much likeyou. Oh, if I could only be like him.'And with a rapt look on her little face she prattles on, leaving mevery few opportunities to get in a word, though I prefer to listen toher rather than talk.I wave good-bye to my friends and then walk along with her, going upand looking back at the crowd over the rail.Reporters are here. They scent something interesting in my affair withthe little girl. I answer all questions. Then a photographer. We arephotographed together. And the movie men are getting action pictures.We are looking back at my friends on shore.The little girl asks: 'Are they all actors and in the movies? Why areyou so sad? Don't you like leaving England? There will be so manyfriends in America to meet you. Why, you should be so happy becauseyou have friends all over the world!'I tell her that it is just the parting--that the thought of leaving isalways sad. Life is always 'Good-bye.' And here I feel it is good-byeto new friends, that my old ones are in America.We walk around the deck and she discusses the merits of my pictures.'Do you like drama?' I ask.'No. I like to laugh, but I love to make people cry myself. It must benice to act 'cryie' parts, but I don't like to watch them.''And you want me to adopt you?''Only in the pictures, like Jackie. I would love to break windows.'She has dark hair and a beautiful profile of the Spanish type, with adelicately formed nose and a Cupid's bow sort of mouth. Her eyes aresensitive, dark and shining, dancing with life and laughter. As wetalk I notice as she gets serious she grows tender and full ofchildish love.'You like smashing windows! You must be Spanish,' I tell her.'Oh no, not Spanish; I'm Jewish,' she answers.'That accounts for your genius.''Oh, do you think Jewish people are clever?' she asks, eagerly.'Of course. All great geniuses had Jewish blood in them. No, I am notJewish,' as she is about to put that question, 'but I am sure theremust be some somewhere in me. I hope so.''Oh, I am so glad you think them clever. You must meet my mother.She's brilliant and an elocutionist. She recites beautifully, and isso clever at anything. And I am sure you would like my father. Heloves me so much and I think he admires me some, too.'She chatters on as we walk around. Then suddenly. 'You look tired.Please tell me and I will run away.'As the boat is pulling out her mother comes toward us and the childintroduces us with perfect formality and without any embarrassment.She is a fine, cultured person.'Come along, dear, we must go down to the second class. We cannot stayhere.'I make an appointment to lunch with the little girl on the day afterthe morrow, and am already looking forward to it.I spend the greater part of the second day in reading books by FrankHarris, Waldo Frank, Claude McKay, and Major Douglas's 'EconomicDemocracy.'The next day I met Miss Taylor, a famous moving-picture actress ofEngland, and Mr. Hepworth, who is a director of prominence in GreatBritain. Miss Taylor, though sensitive, shy, and retiring, has a greatbit of charm.They are making their first trip to America, and we soon become goodfriends. We discuss the characteristics of the American people,contrasting their youthful, frank abruptness with the quiet, shy, andreserved Britisher.I find myself running wild as I tell them of this land. I explaintrain hold-ups, advertising signs, Broadway lights, blatant theatres,ticket speculators, subways, the automat and its big sister, thecafeteria. It has a great effect on my friends and at times I almostdetect unbelief. I find myself wanting to show the whole thing to themand to watch their reactions.At luncheon next day the little girl is the soul of the party. Wediscuss everything from Art to ambitions. At one moment she is full ofmusical laughter, and the next she is excitedly discussing somehappening aboard ship. Her stories are always interesting. How dochildren see so much more than grown-ups?She has a great time. I must visit her father, he is so much like me.He has the same temperament, and is such a great daddy. He is so goodto her. And she rattles on without stopping.Then again she thinks I may be tired. 'Sit back now.' And she puts apillow behind my head and bids me rest.These moments with her make days aboard pass quickly and pleasantly.Carl Robinson and I are strolling around the top deck the next day inan effort to get away from everyone, and I notice someone looking upat a wire running between the funnels of the ship. Perched on the wireis a little bird, and I am wondering how it got there and if it hadbeen there since we left England.The other watcher notices us. He turns and smiles. 'The little birdmust think this is the promised land.'I knew at once that he was somebody. Those thoughts belong only topoets. Later in the evening he joins us at my invitation and I learnhe is Easthope Martin, the composer and pianist. He had been throughthe War and it had left its stamp on this fine, sensitive soul. He hadbeen gassed. I could not imagine such a man in the trenches.He is very frail of body, and as he talks I always imagine his bigsoul at the bursting point with a pent-up yearning.There is the inevitable concert on the last night of the voyage. Weare off the banks of Newfoundland, and in the midst of a fog. Foghorns must be kept blowing at intervals, hence the effect on theconcert, particularly the vocal part, is obvious.We land at seven in the morning of a very windy day, and it is elevenbefore we can get away. Reporters and camera men fill the air duringall that time, and I am rather glad, because it shows Miss Taylor andMr. Hepworth a glimpse of what America is like. We arrange to meetthat night at Sam Goldwyn's for dinner.Good-byes here are rather joyous, because we are all getting off inthe same land and there will be an opportunity to see one anotheragain.My little friend comes to me excitedly and gives me a present--asilver stamp box. 'I hope that when you write your first letter youtake a stamp from here and mail it to me. Good-bye.'She shakes hands. We are real lovers and must be careful. She tells menot to overwork. 'Don't forget to come and see us; you must meetdaddy. Good-bye, Charlie.'She curtsies and is gone. I go to my cabin to wait until we can land.There is a tiny knock. She comes in.'Charlie, I couldn't kiss you out there in front of all those people.Good-bye, dear. Take care of yourself.' This is real love. She kissesmy cheek and then runs out on deck.Easthope Martin is with us that night at Goldwyn's party. He plays oneof his own compositions and holds us spellbound. He is very gratefulfor our sincere applause and quite retiring and unassuming, though heis the hit of the evening.Following the dinner I carried the English movie folk on asight-seeing trip, enjoying their amazement at the wonders of a NewYork night.'What do you think of it?' I asked them.'Thrilling,' says Hepworth. 'I like it. There is something electricalin the air. It is a driving force. You must do things.'We go to a cafe, where the elite of New York are gathered, and danceuntil midnight. I bid them good-bye, hoping to meet them later whenthey come to Los Angeles.I dine at Max Eastman's the next night and meet McKay, the negro poet.He is quite handsome, a full-blooded Jamaican negro not more thantwenty-five years of age. I can readily see why he has been termed anAfrican prince. He has just that manner.I have read a number of his poems. He is a true aristocrat with thesensitiveness of a poet and the humour of a philosopher, and quiteshy. In fact, he is rather supersensitive, but with a dignity andmanner that seem to hold him aloof.There are many other friends there, and we discuss Max's new book onhumour. There is a controversy whether to call it 'Sense of Humour' or'Psychology of Humour.' We talk about my trip. Claude McKay asks if Imet Shaw. 'Too bad,' he says. 'You would like him and he would haveenjoyed you.'I am interested in Claude. 'How do you write your poetry? Can you makeyourself write? Do you prepare?' I try to discuss his race. 'What istheir future? Do they----'He shrugs his shoulders. I realise he is a poet, an aristocrat.I dine the next evening with Waldo Frank and Marguerite Naumberg andwe discuss her new system. She has a school that develops childrenalong the lines of personality. It is a study in individuality. Sheis struggling alone, but is getting wonderful results. We talk farinto the morning on everything, including the fourth dimension.Next day Frank Harris calls and we decide to take a trip to Sing Singtogether. Frank is very sad and wistful. He is anxious to get awayfrom New York and devote time to his autobiography before it is toolate. He has so much to say that he wants to write it while it iskeen.I try to tell him that consciousness of age is a sign of keenness.That age doesn't bother the mind.We discuss George Meredith and a wonderful book he had written. Andthen in his age Meredith had rewritten it. He said it was so muchbetter rewritten, but he had taken from it all the red blood. It wasold, withered like himself. You can't see things as they were.Meredith had become old. Harris says he doesn't want the sameexperience.All this on the way to Sing Sing. Frank is a wonderfulconversationalist. Like his friend Oscar Wilde. That same charm andbrilliancy of wit, ever ready for argument. What a fund of knowledgehe has. What a biography his should be. If it is just half as good asWilde's, it will be sufficient.Sing Sing. The big, grey stone buildings seem to me like an outcryagainst civilisation. This huge grey monster with its thousand staringeyes. We are in the visiting room. Young men in grey shirts. ThankGod, the hideous stripes are gone. This is progress, humanity. It isnot so stark.There is a mite of a baby holding her daddy's hand and playing withhis hair as he talks with her mamma, his wife. Another prisonerholding two withered hands of an old lady. Mother was written all overher, though neither said a word. I felt brutal at witnessing theiremotion.All of them old. Children, widows, mothers--youth crossed out of facesby lines of suffering and life's penalties. Tragedy and sadness, andalways it is in the faces of the women that the suffering is moreplainly written. The men suffer in body--the women in soul.The men look resigned. Their spirit is gone. What is it that happensbehind these grey walls that kills so completely?The devotion of the prisoners is almost childish in its eagerness asthey sit with their children, talking with their wives, here and therea lover with his sweetheart--all of them have written a compellingstory in the book of life. But love is in this room, love unashamed.Why are sinners always loved? Why do sinners make such wonderfullovers? Perhaps it is compensation, as they call it. Love is paged byevery eye here.Children are playing around the floor. Their laughter is like abenediction. This is another improvement, this room. There are nolonger bars to separate loved ones. Human nature improves, but thetragedy remains just as dramatic.The cells where they sleep are old-fashioned, built by a monster or amaniac. No architect could do such a thing for human beings. They arebuilt of hate, ignorance, and stupidity. I understand they arebuilding a new prison, more sane, with far more understanding of humanneeds. Until then these poor wretches must endure these awful cells.I'd go mad there.I notice quite a bit of freedom. A number of prisoners are strollingaround the grounds while others are at work. The honour system is agreat thing, gives a man a chance to hold self-respect.They have heard that I am coming, and most of them seem to know me. Iam embarrassed. What can I say? How can I approach them? I wave myhand merely. 'Hello, folks!'I decide to discard conversation. Be myself. Be comic. Cut up. I twistmy cane and juggle my hat. I kick up my leg in back. I am on comicground. That's the thing.No sentiment, no slopping over, no morals--they are fed up with that.What is there in common between us? Our viewpoints are entirelydifferent. They're in--I'm out.They show me a cup presented by Sir Thomas Lipton, inscribed, 'We haveall made mistakes.''How do we know but what some of you haven't?' I ask, humorously. Itmakes a hit. They want me to talk.'Brother criminals and fellow sinners: Christ said, 'Let him who iswithout sin cast the first stone.' I cannot cast the stone, though Ihave compromised and thrown many a pie. But I cannot cast the firststone.' Some got it. Others never will.We must be sensible. I am not a hero worshipper of criminals and badmen. Society must be protected. We are greater in number than thecriminals and have the upper hand. We must keep it; but we can atleast treat them intelligently, for, after all, crime is the outcomeof society.The doctor tells me that but a few of them are criminals fromheredity, that the majority had been forced into crime bycircumstances or had committed it in passion. I notice a lot ofevil-looking men, but also some splendid ones. I earnestly believethat society can protect itself intelligently, humanly. I wouldabolish prisons. Call them hospitals and treat the prisoners aspatients.It is a problem that I make no pretence of solving.The death house. It is hideous. A plain, bare room, rather large andwith a white door, not green, as I have been told. The chair--a plainwooden armchair and a single wire coming down over it. This is aninstrument to snuff out life. It is too simple. It is not evendramatic. Just cold-blooded and matter of fact.Some one is telling me how they watch the prisoner after he isstrapped in the chair. Good God! How can they calmly plan with suchexactness? And they have killed as many as seven in one day. I mustget out.Two men were walking up and down in a bare yard, one a short man witha pipe in his mouth, walking briskly, and at his side a warden. Thekeeper announces, shortly, 'The next for the chair.'How awful! Looking straight in front of him and coming toward us, Isaw his face. Tragic and appalling. I will see it for a long time.We visit the industries. There is something ironical about theirlocation with the mountains for a background, but the effect is good,they can get a sense of freedom. A good system here, with the wardenstolerant. They seem to understand. I whisper to one.'Is Jim Larkin here?' He is in the boot department, and we go to seehim for a moment. There is a rule against it, but on this occasion therule is waived.Larkin struts up. Large, about six feet two inches, a fine, strappingIrishman. Introduced, he talks timidly.He can't stay, mustn't leave his work. Is happy. Only worried abouthis wife and children in Ireland. Anxious about them, otherwise fit.There are four more years for him. He seems deserted even by hisparty, though there is an effort being made to have his sentencerepealed. After all, he is no ordinary criminal. Just a political one.He asks about my reception in England. 'Glad to meet you, but I mustget back.'Frank tells him he will help to get his release. He smiles, gripsFrank's hand hard. 'Thanks.' Harris tells me he is a cultured man anda fine writer.But the prison marked him. The buoyancy and spirit that must have gonewith those Irish eyes are no more. Those same eyes are now wistful,where they once were gay. He hasn't been forgotten. Our visit hashelped. There may be a bit of hope left to him.We go to the solitary-confinement cell, where trouble makers are kept.'This young man tried to escape, got out on the roof. We went afterhim,' says the warden.'Yes, it was quite a movie stunt,' said the youngster. He isembarrassed. We try to relieve it.'Whatever he's done, he's darn handsome,' I tell the warden. It helps.'Better luck next time,' I tell him. He laughs. 'Thanks. Pleased tomeet you, Charlie.'He is just nineteen, handsome and healthy. What a pity! The greatesttragedy of all. He is a forger, here with murderers.We leave and I look back at the prison just once. Why are prisons andgraveyards built in such beautiful places?Next day everything is bustling, getting ready for the trip back toLos Angeles. I sneak out in the excitement and go to a matinee to seeMarie Doro in 'Lilies of the Field,' and that night to 'The Hero,' asplendid play. A young actor, Robert Ames, I believe, gives the finESTJerformance I have ever seen in America.We are on the way. I am rushing back with the swiftness of theTwentieth Century Limited. There is a wire from my studio manager.'When will I be back for work?' I wire him that I am rushing andanxious to get there. There is a brief stop in Chicago and then we areon again.And as the train rushes me back I am living again this vacation ofmine. Its every moment now seems wonderful. The petty annoyances werebut seasoning. I even begin to like reporters. They are regularfellows, intent on their job.And going over it all, it has been so worth while and the job ahead ofme looks worth while. If I can bring smiles to the tired eyes inKennington and Whitechapel, if I have absorbed and understood thevirtues and problems of those simpler people I have met, and if I havegathered the least bit of inspiration from those greater personageswho were kind to me, then this has been a wonderful trip, and somehowI am eager to get back to work and begin paying for it.I notice a newspaper headline as I write. It tells of the Conferencefor Disarmament. Is it prophetic? Does it mean that War will neverstride through the world again? Is it a gleam of intelligence cominginto the world?We are arriving at Ogden, Utah, as I write. There is a telegram askingme to dine with Clare Sheridan on my arrival in Los Angeles. Theprospect is most alluring. And that wire, with several others,convinces me that I am getting home.I turn again to the newspaper. My holiday is over. I reflect ondisarmament. I wonder what will be the answer? I hope and am inclinedto believe that it will be for good. Was it Tennyson who wrote:         When shall all men's good     Be each man's rule, and universal peace     Shine like a shaft of light across the lane,     And like a layer of beams athwart the sea?What a beautiful thought! Can those who go to Washington make it morethan a thought?The conductor is calling:'Los Angeles.''Bye.'THE END.
ISFJ	
ISFJ	 I.Childhood and Early Impressions.  The Blessing of Pious Parents.Desire of Martyrdom.  Death of the Saint's Mother.1. I had a father and mother, who were devout and feared God.Our Lord also helped me with His grace.  All this would have beenenough to make me good, if I had not been so wicked.  My fatherwas very much given to the reading of good books; and so he hadthem in Spanish, that his children might read them.  These books,with my mother's carefulness to make us say our prayers, and tobring us up devout to our Lady and to certain Saints, began tomake me think seriously when I was, I believe, six or seven yearsold.  It helped me, too, that I never saw my father and motherrespect anything but goodness.  They were very good themselves.My father was a man of great charity towards the poor, andcompassion for the sick, and also for servants; so much so, thathe never could be persuaded to keep slaves, for he pitied them somuch: and a slave belonging to one of his brothers being once inhis house, was treated by him with as much tenderness as his ownchildren.  He used to say that he could not endure the pain ofseeing that she was not free.  He was a man of greattruthfulness; nobody ever heard him swear or speak ill of anyone; his life was most pure.2. My mother also was a woman of great goodness, and her life wasspent in great infirmities.  She was singularly pure in all herways.  Though possessing great beauty, yet was it never knownthat she gave reason to suspect that she made any accountwhatever of it; for, though she was only three-and-thirty yearsof age when she died, her apparel was already that of a womanadvanced in years.  She was very calm, and had great sense.The sufferings she went through during her life were grievous,her death most Christian. [1]3. We were three sisters and nine brothers. [2]  All, by themercy of God, resembled their parents in goodness except myself,though I was the most cherished of my father.  And, before Ibegan to offend God, I think he had some reason,--for I am filledwith sorrow whenever I think of the good desires with which ourLord inspired me, and what a wretched use I made of them.Besides, my brothers never in any way hindered me in the serviceof God.4. One of my brothers was nearly of my own age; [3] and he it waswhom I most loved, though I was very fond of them all, and theyof me.  He and I used to read Lives of Saints together.  When Iread of martyrdom undergone by the Saints for the love of God, itstruck me that the vision of God was very cheaply purchased; andI had a great desire to die a martyr's death,--not out of anylove of Him of which I was conscious, but that I might mostquickly attain to the fruition of those great joys of which Iread that they were reserved in Heaven; and I used to discusswith my brother how we could become martyrs.  We settled to gotogether to the country of the Moors, [4] begging our way for thelove of God, that we might be there beheaded; [5] and our Lord, Ibelieve, had given us courage enough, even at so tender an age,if we could have found the means to proceed; but our greatestdifficulty seemed to be our father and mother.5. It astonished us greatly to find it said in what we werereading that pain and bliss were everlasting.  We happened veryoften to talk about this; and we had a pleasure in repeatingfrequently, 'For ever, ever, ever.'  Through the constantuttering of these words, our Lord was pleased that I shouldreceive an abiding impression of the way of truth when I was yeta child.6. As soon as I saw it was impossible to go to any place wherepeople would put me to death for the sake of God, my brother andI set about becoming hermits; and in an orchard belonging to thehouse we contrived, as well as we could, to build hermitages, bypiling up small stones one on the other, which fell downimmediately; and so it came to pass that we found no means ofaccomplishing our wish.  Even now, I have a feeling of devotionwhen I consider how God gave me in my early youth what I lost bymy own fault.  I gave alms as I could--and I could but little.I contrived to be alone, for the sake of saying myprayers [6]--and they were many--especially the Rosary, to whichmy mother had a great devotion, and had made us also in this likeherself.  I used to delight exceedingly, when playing with otherchildren, in the building of monasteries, as if we were nuns; andI think I wished to be a nun, though not so much as I did to be amartyr or a hermit.7. I remember that, when my mother died, [7] I was about twelveyears old--a little less.  When I began to understand my loss, Iwent in my affliction to an image of our Lady, [8] and with manytears implored her to be my mother.  I did this in my simplicity,and I believe that it was of service to me; for I have byexperience found the royal Virgin help me whenever I recommendedmyself to her; and at last she has brought me back to herself.It distresses me now, when I think of, and reflect on, that whichkept me from being earnest in the good desires with whichI began.8. O my Lord, since Thou art determined to save me--may it be thepleasure of Thy Majesty to effect it!--and to bestow upon me somany graces, why has it not been Thy pleasure also--not for myadvantage, but for Thy greater honour--that this habitation,wherein Thou hast continually to dwell, should not havecontracted so much defilement?  It distresses me even to saythis, O my Lord, because I know the fault is all my own, seeingthat Thou hast left nothing undone to make me, even from myyouth, wholly Thine.  When I would complain of my parents, Icannot do it; for I saw nothing in them but all good, andcarefulness for my welfare.  Then, growing up, I began todiscover the natural gifts which our Lord had given me--they weresaid to be many; and, when I should have given Him thanks forthem, I made use of every one of them, as I shall now explain, tooffend Him.1. See ch. xxxvii. § 1; where the Saint says that she saw them ina vision both in Heaven.2. Alfonso Sanchez de Cepeda, father of the Saint, married firstCatalina del Peso y Henao, and had three children--one daughter,Maria de Cepeda, and two sons.  After the death of Catalina, hemarried Beatriz Davila y Ahumada, by whom he had ninechildren--seven boys and two girls.  The third of these, and theeldest of the daughters, was the Saint, Doña Teresa SanchezCepeda Davila y Ahumada.  In the Monastery of the Incarnation,where she was a professed nun for twenty-eight years, she wasknown as Doña Teresa; but in the year 1563, when she left hermonastery for the new foundation of St. Joseph, of the Reform ofthe Carmelites, she took for the first time the name of Teresa ofJesus (De la Fuente).  The Saint was born March 28, 1515, andbaptized on the 4th of April, in the church of St. John; on whichday Mass was said for the first time in the Monastery of theIncarnation, where the Saint made her profession.  Her godfatherwas Vela Nuñez, and her godmother Doña Maria del Aguila.The Bollandists and Father Bouix say that she was baptized on thevery day of her birth.  But the testimony of Doña Maria de Pinel,a nun in the Monastery of the Incarnation, is clear: and DonVicente de La Fuente, quoting it, vol. i. p. 549, says that thisdelay of baptism was nothing singular in those days, providedthere was no danger of death.3. Rodrigo de Cepeda, four years older than the Saint, enteredthe army, and, serving in South America, was drowned in the riverPlate, Rio de la Plata.  St. Teresa always considered him amartyr, because he died in defence of the Catholic faith (Ribera,lib. i. ch. iii.).  Before he sailed for the Indies, he made hiswill, and left all his property to the Saint, his sister (Reformade los Descalços, vol. i. lib. i. ch. iii. § 4).4. The Bollandists incline to believe that St. Teresa may nothave intended to quit Spain, because all the Moors were not atthat time driven out of the country.  The Bull of the Saint'scanonization, and the Lections of the Breviary, say that she lefther father's house, ut in Africam trajiceret.5. The two children set out on their strange journey--one of themseven, the other eleven, years old--through the Adaja Gate; butwhen they had crossed the bridge, they were met by one of theiruncles, who brought them back to their mother, who had alreadysent through Avila in quest of them.  Rodrigo, like Adam, excusedhimself, and laid the blame on the woman (Ribera,lib. i. ch. iii.).  Francisco de Santa Maria, chronicler of theOrder, says that the uncle was Francisco Alvarez de Cepeda(Reforma de los Descalços, lib. i. ch. v. § 4).6. She was also marvellously touched by the story of theSamaritan woman at the well, of whom there was a picture in herroom (Ribera, lib. i. ch. iv.).  She speaks of this later on.(See ch. xxx. § 24.)7. The last will and testament of Doña Beatriz de Ahumada wasmade November 24, 1528 and she may have died soon after.If there be no mistake in the copy of that instrument, the Saintmust have been more than twelve years old at that time.Don Vicente, in a note, says, with the Bollandists, that DoñaBeatriz died at the end of the year 1526, or in the beginning of1527; but it is probable that, when he wrote that note, he hadnot read the copy of the will, which he has printed in the firstvolume of the Saint's writings, p. 550.8.

ISFJ	 II.Early Impressions.  Dangerous Books and Companions.  The Saint IsPlaced in a Monastery.1. What I shall now speak of was, I believe, the beginning ofgreat harm to me.  I often think how wrong it is of parents notto be very careful that their children should always, and inevery way, see only that which is good; for though my mother was,as I have just said, so good herself, nevertheless I, when I cameto the use of reason, did not derive so much good from her as Iought to have done--almost none at all; and the evil I learneddid me much harm.  She was very fond of books of chivalry; butthis pastime did not hurt her so much as it hurt me, because shenever wasted her time on them; only we, her children, were leftat liberty to read them; and perhaps she did this to distract herthoughts from her great sufferings, and occupy her children, thatthey might not go astray in other ways.  It annoyed my father somuch, that we had to be careful he never saw us.  I contracted ahabit of reading these books; and this little fault which Iobserved in my mother was the beginning of lukewarmness in mygood desires, and the occasion of my falling away in otherrespects.  I thought there was no harm in it when I wasted manyhours night and day in so vain an occupation, even when I kept ita secret from my father.  So completely was I mastered by thispassion, that I thought I could never be happy without anew book.2. I began to make much of dress, to wish to please others by myappearance.  I took pains with my hands and my hair, usedperfumes, and all vanities within my reach--and they were many,for I was very much given to them.  I had no evil intention,because I never wished any one to offend God for me.This fastidiousness of excessive neatness [1] lasted some years;and so also did other practices, which I thought then were not atall sinful; now, I see how wrong all this must have been.3. I had some cousins; for into my father's house no others wereallowed an entrance.  In this he was very cautious; and would toGod he had been cautious about them!--for I see now the danger ofconversing, at an age when virtue should begin to grow, withpersons who, knowing nothing themselves of the vanity of theworld, provoke others to throw themselves into the midst of it.These cousins were nearly of mine own age--a little older,perhaps.  We were always together; and they had a great affectionfor me.  In everything that gave them pleasure, I kept theconversation alive,--listened to the stories of their affectionsand childish follies, good for nothing; and, what was stillworse, my soul began to give itself up to that which was thecause of all its disorders.  If I were to give advice, I wouldsay to parents that they ought to be very careful whom they allowto mix with their children when young; for much mischief thenceensues, and our natural inclinations are unto evil rather thanunto good.4. So it was with me; for I had a sister much older thanmyself, [2] from whose modesty and goodness, which were great, Ilearned nothing; and learned every evil from a relative who wasoften in the house.  She was so light and frivolous, that mymother took great pains to keep her out of the house, as if sheforesaw the evil I should learn from her; but she could notsucceed, there being so many reasons for her coming.  I was veryfond of this person's company, gossiped and talked with her; forshe helped me in all the amusements I liked, and, what is more,found some for me, and communicated to me her own conversationsand her vanities.  Until I knew her, I mean, until she becamefriendly with me, and communicated to me her own affairs--I wasthen about fourteen years old, a little more, I think--I do notbelieve that I turned away from God in mortal sin, or lost thefear of Him, though I had a greater fear of disgrace.This latter fear had such sway over me, that I never whollyforfeited my good name--and, as to that, there was nothing in theworld for which I would have bartered it, and nobody in the worldI liked well enough who could have persuaded me to do it.  Thus Imight have had the strength never to do anything against thehonour of God, as I had it by nature not to fail in that whereinI thought the honour of the world consisted; and I never observedthat I was failing in many other ways.  In vainly seeking afterit I was extremely careful; but in the use of the means necessaryfor preserving it I was utterly careless. I was anxious only notto be lost altogether.5. This friendship distressed my father and sister exceedingly.They often blamed me for it; but, as they could not hinder thatperson from coming into the house, all their efforts were invain; for I was very adroit in doing anything that was wrong.Now and then, I am amazed at the evil one bad companion cando,--nor could I believe it if I did not know it byexperience,--especially when we are young: then is it that theevil must be greatest.  Oh, that parents would take warning byme, and look carefully to this! So it was; the conversation ofthis person so changed me, that no trace was left of my soul'snatural disposition to virtue, and I became a reflection of herand of another who was given to the same kind of amusements.6. I know from this the great advantage of good companions; and Iam certain that if at that tender age I had been thrown amonggood people, I should have persevered in virtue; for if at thattime I had found any one to teach me the fear of God, my soulwould have grown strong enough not to fall away. Afterwards, whenthe fear of God had utterly departed from me, the fear ofdishonour alone remained, and was a torment to me in all I did.When I thought that nobody would ever know, I ventured upon manythings that were neither honourable nor pleasing unto God.7. In the beginning, these conversations did me harm--I believeso.  The fault was perhaps not hers, but mine; for afterwards myown wickedness was enough to lead me astray, together with theservants about me, whom I found ready enough for all evil.If any one of these had given me good advice, I might perhapshave profited by it; but they were blinded by interest, as I wasby passion.  Still, I was never inclined to much evil,--for Ihated naturally anything dishonourable,--but only to theamusement of a pleasant conversation.  The occasion of sin,however, being present, danger was at hand, and I exposed to itmy father and brothers.  God delivered me out of it all, so thatI should not be lost, in a manner visibly against my will, yetnot so secretly as to allow me to escape without the loss of mygood name and the suspicions of my father.8. I had not spent, I think, three months in these vanities, whenthey took me to a monastery [3] in the city where I lived, inwhich children like myself were brought up, though their way oflife was not so wicked as mine.  This was done with the utmostconcealment of the true reason, which was known only to myselfand one of my kindred.  They waited for an opportunity whichwould make the change seem nothing out of the way; for, as mysister was married, it was not fitting I should remain alone,without a mother, in the house.9. So excessive was my father's love for me, and so deep mydissembling, that he never would believe me to be so wicked as Iwas; and hence I was never in disgrace with him.  Though someremarks were made, yet, as the time had been short, nothing couldbe positively asserted; and, as I was so much afraid about mygood name, I had taken every care to be secret; and yet I neverconsidered that I could conceal nothing from Him Who seeth allthings.  O my God, what evil is done in the world by disregardingthis, and thinking that anything can be kept secret that is doneagainst Thee!  I am quite certain that great evils would beavoided if we clearly understood that what we have to do is, notto be on our guard against men, but on our guard againstdispleasing Thee.10. For the first eight days, I suffered much; but more from thesuspicion that my vanity was known, than from being in themonastery; for I was already weary of myself--and, though Ioffended God, I never ceased to have a great fear of Him, andcontrived to go to confession as quickly as I could.  I was veryuncomfortable; but within eight days, I think sooner, I was muchmore contented than I had been in my father's house.  All thenuns were pleased with me; for our Lord had given me the grace toplease every one, wherever I might be.  I was therefore made muchof in the monastery.  Though at this time I hated to be a nun,yet I was delighted at the sight of nuns so good; for they werevery good in that house--very prudent, observant of the rule,and recollected.11. Yet, for all this, the devil did not cease to tempt me; andpeople in the world sought means to trouble my rest with messagesand presents.  As this could not be allowed, it was soon over,and my soul began to return to the good habits of my earlieryears; and I recognized the great mercy of God to those whom Heplaces among good people.  It seems as if His Majesty had soughtand sought again how to convert me to Himself.  Blessed be Thou,O Lord, for having borne with me so long!  Amen.12. Were it not for my many faults, there was some excuse for me,I think, in this: that the conversation I shared in was with onewho, I thought, would do well in the estate of matrimony; [4] andI was told by my confessors, and others also, whom in many pointsI consulted, used to say, that I was not offending God.  One ofthe nuns [5] slept with us who were seculars, and through her itpleased our Lord to give me light, as I shall now explain.1. The Saint throughout her life was extremely careful ofcleanliness.  In one of her letters to Father Jerome Gratian ofthe Mother of God (No. 323, Letter 28, vol. iii. ed. Doblado),she begs him, for the love of God, to see that the Fathers hadclean cells and table; and the Ven. Mother Anne ofSt. Bartholomew, in her life (Bruxelles, 1708, p. 40), says thatshe changed the Saint's linen on the day of her death, and wasthanked by her for her carefulness.  'Her soul was so pure,' saysthe Ven. Mother, 'that she could not bear anything that wasnot clean.'2. Maria de Cepeda, half-sister of the Saint.  She was married toDon Martin de Guzman y Barrientos; and the contract for the dowrywas signed January 11, 1531 (Reforma de los Descalçoslib. i. ch. vii. § 4).3. The Augustinian Monastery of Our Lady of Grace.  It wasfounded in 1509 by the venerable Fra Juan of Seville,Vicar-General of the Order (Reforma de los Descalçoslib. i. ch. vii. n. 2).  There were forty nuns in the house atthis time (De la Fuente).4. Some have said that the Saint at this time intended, orwished, to be married; and Father Bouix translates the passagethus: 'une alliance honorable pour moi.'  But it is more probablethat the Saint had listened only to the story of her cousin'sintended marriage; for in ch. v. § 11, she says that our Lord hadalways kept her from seeking to be loved of men.5. Doña Maria Brizeño, mistress of the secular children who wereeducated in the monastery (Reforma, lib. i. ch. vii. § 3).
ISFJ	 III.The Blessing of Being with Good People.  How Certain IllusionsWere Removed.1. I began gradually to like the good and holy conversation ofthis nun.  How well she used to speak of God! for she was aperson of great discretion and sanctity.  I listened to her withdelight.  I think there never was a time when I was not glad tolisten to her.  She began by telling me how she came to be a nunthrough the mere reading of the words of the Gospel 'Many arecalled, and few are chosen.' [1]  She would speak of the rewardwhich our Lord gives to those who forsake all things for Hissake.  This good companionship began to root out the habits whichbad companionship had formed, and to bring my thoughts back tothe desire of eternal things, as well as to banish in somemeasure the great dislike I had to be a nun, which had been verygreat; and if I saw any one weep in prayer, or devout in anyother way, I envied her very much; for my heart was now so hard,that I could not shed a tear, even if I read the Passion through.This was a grief to me.2. I remained in the monastery a year and a half, and was verymuch the better for it.  I began to say many vocal prayers, andto ask all the nuns to pray for me, that God would place me inthat state wherein I was to serve Him; but, for all this, Iwished not to be a nun, and that God would not be pleased Ishould be one, though at the same time I was afraid of marriage.At the end of my stay there, I had a greater inclination to be anun, yet not in that house, on account of certain devotionalpractices which I understood prevailed there, and which I thoughtoverstrained.  Some of the younger ones encouraged me in this mywish; and if all had been of one mind, I might have profited byit.  I had also a great friend [2] in another monastery; and thismade me resolve, if I was to be a nun, not to be one in any otherhouse than where she was.  I looked more to the pleasure of senseand vanity than to the good of my soul.  These good thoughts ofbeing a nun came to me from time to time.  They left me verysoon; and I could not persuade myself to become one.3. At this time, though I was not careless about my own good, ourLord was much more careful to dispose me for that state of lifewhich was best for me.  He sent me a serious illness, so that Iwas obliged to return to my father's house.4. When I became well again, they took me to see my sister [3] inher house in the country village where she dwelt. Her love for mewas so great, that, if she had had her will, I should never haveleft her.  Her husband also had a great affection for me--atleast, he showed me all kindness.  This too I owe rather to ourLord, for I have received kindness everywhere; and all my servicein return is, that I am what I am.5. On the road lived a brother of my father [4]--a prudent andmost excellent man, then a widower.  Him too our Lord waspreparing for Himself.  In his old age, he left all hispossessions and became a religious.  He so finished his course,that I believe him to have the vision of God.  He would have mestay with him some days.  His practice was to read good books inSpanish; and his ordinary conversation was about God and thevanity of the world.  These books he made me read to him; and,though I did not much like them, I appeared as if I did; for ingiving pleasure to others I have been most particular, though itmight be painful to myself--so much so, that what in others mighthave been a virtue was in me a great fault, because I was oftenextremely indiscreet.  O my God, in how many ways did His Majestyprepare me for the state wherein it was His will I should serveHim!--how, against my own will, He constrained me to do violenceto myself!  May He be blessed for ever!  Amen.6. Though I remained here but a few days, yet, through theimpression made on my heart by the words of God both heard andread, and by the good conversation of my uncle, I came tounderstand the truth I had heard in my childhood, that all thingsare as nothing, the world vanity, and passing rapidly away.I also began to be afraid that, if I were then to die, I shouldgo down to hell.  Though I could not bend my will to be a nun, Isaw that the religious state was the best and the safest.And thus, by little and little, I resolved to force myselfinto it.7. The struggle lasted three months.  I used to press this reasonagainst myself: The trials and sufferings of living as a nuncannot be greater than those of purgatory, and I have welldeserved to be in hell.  It is not much to spend the rest of mylife as if I were in purgatory, and then go straight toHeaven--which was what I desired.  I was more influenced byservile fear, I think, than by love, to enter religion.8. The devil put before me that I could not endure the trials ofthe religious life, because of my delicate nurture.  I defendedmyself against him by alleging the trials which Christ endured,and that it was not much for me to suffer something for His sake;besides, He would help me to bear it.  I must have thought so,but I do not remember this consideration.  I endured manytemptations during these days.  I was subject to fainting-fits,attended with fever,--for my health was always weak.  I hadbecome by this time fond of good books, and that gave me life.I read the Epistles of St. Jerome, which filled me with so muchcourage, that I resolved to tell my father of my purpose,--whichwas almost like taking the habit; for I was so jealous of myword, that I would never, for any consideration, recede from apromise when once my word had been given.9. My father's love for me was so great, that I could neverobtain his consent; nor could the prayers of others, whom Ipersuaded to speak to him, be of any avail.  The utmost I couldget from him was that I might do as I pleased after his death.I now began to be afraid of myself, and of my own weakness--for Imight go back.  So, considering that such waiting was not safefor me, I obtained my end in another way, as I shall now relate.1. St. Matt. xx. 16: 'Multi enim sunt vocati, pauci vero electi.'2. Juana Suarez, in the Monastery of the incarnation, Avila(Reforma, lib. i. ch. vii. § 7).3. Maria de Cepeda, married to Don Martin Guzman y Barrientos.They lived in Castellanos de la Cañada, where they hadconsiderable property; but in the later years of their lives theywere in straitened circumstances (De la Fuente).

ISFJ	 IV.Our Lord Helps Her to Become a Nun.  Her Many Infirmities.1. In those days, when I was thus resolved, I had persuaded oneof my brothers, [1] by speaking to him of the vanity of theworld, to become a friar; and we agreed together to set out oneday very early in the morning for the monastery where that friendof mine lived for whom I had so great an affection: [2] though Iwould have gone to any other monastery, if I thought I shouldserve God better in it, or to any one my father liked, so strongwas my resolution now to become a nun--for I thought more of thesalvation of my soul now, and made no account whatever of mineown ease.  I remember perfectly well, and it is quite true, thatthe pain I felt when I left my father's house was so great, thatI do not believe the pain of dying will be greater--for it seemedto me as if every bone in my body were wrenched asunder; [3] for,as I had no love of God to destroy my love of father and ofkindred, this latter love came upon me with a violence so greatthat, if our Lord had not been my keeper, my own resolution to goon would have failed me.  But He gave me courage to fight againstmyself, so that I executed my purpose. [4]2. When I took the habit, [5] our Lord at once made me understandhow He helps those who do violence to themselves in order toserve Him.  No one observed this violence in me; they saw nothingbut the greatest good will.  At that moment, because I wasentering on that state, I was filled with a joy so great, that ithas never failed me to this day; and God converted the aridity ofmy soul into the greatest tenderness.  Everything in religion wasa delight unto me; and it is true that now and then I used tosweep the house during those hours of the day which I hadformerly spent on my amusements and my dress; and, calling tomind that I was delivered from such follies, I was filled with anew joy that surprised me, nor could I understand whence it came.3. Whenever I remember this, there is nothing in the world,however hard it may be, that, if it were proposed to me, I wouldnot undertake without any hesitation whatever; for I know now, byexperience in many things, that if from the first I resolutelypersevere in my purpose, even in this life His Majesty rewards itin a way which he only understands who has tried it.  When theact is done for God only, it is His will before we begin it thatthe soul, in order to the increase of its merits, should beafraid; and the greater the fear, if we do but succeed, thegreater the reward, and the sweetness thence afterwardsresulting.  I know this by experience, as I have just said, inmany serious affairs; and so, if I were a person who had toadvise anybody, I would never counsel any one, to whom goodinspirations from time to time may come, to resist them throughfear of the difficulty of carrying them into effect; for if aperson lives detached for the love of God only, that is no reasonfor being afraid of failure, for He is omnipotent.  May He beblessed for ever!  Amen.4. O supreme Good, and my Rest, those graces ought to have beenenough which Thou hadst given me hitherto, seeing that Thycompassion and greatness had drawn me through so many windings toa state so secure, to a house where there are so many servants ofGod, from whom I might learn how I may advance in Thy service.I know not how to go on, when I call to mind the circumstances ofmy profession, the great resolution and joy with which I made it,and my betrothal unto Thee.  I cannot speak of it without tears;and my tears ought to be tears of blood, my heart ought to break,and that would not be much to suffer because of the many offencesagainst Thee which I have committed since that day.  It seems tome now that I had good reasons for not wishing for this dignity,seeing that I have made so sad a use of it.  But Thou, O my Lord,hast been willing to bear with me for almost twenty years of myevil using of Thy graces, till I might become better.  It seemsto me, O my God, that I did nothing but promise never to keep anyof the promises then made to Thee.  Yet such was not myintention: but I see that what I have done since is of such anature, that I know not what my intention was.  So it was and soit happened, that it may be the better known, O my Bridegroom,Who Thou art and what I am.5. It is certainly true that very frequently the joy I have inthat the multitude of Thy mercies is made known in me, softensthe bitter sense of my great faults.  In whom, O Lord, can theyshine forth as they do in me, who by my evil deeds have shroudedin darkness Thy great graces, which Thou hadst begun to work inme?  Woe is me, O my Maker!  If I would make an excuse, I havenone to offer; and I only am to blame.  For if I could return toThee any portion of that love which Thou hadst begun to show untome, I would give it only unto Thee, and then everything wouldhave been safe.  But, as I have not deserved this, nor been sohappy as to have done it, let Thy mercy, O Lord, rest upon me.6. The change in the habits of my life, and in my food, provedhurtful to my health; and though my happiness was great, that wasnot enough.  The fainting-fits began to be more frequent; and myheart was so seriously affected, that every one who saw it wasalarmed; and I had also many other ailments.  And thus it was Ispent the first year, having very bad health, though I do notthink I offended God in it much.  And as my illness was soserious--I was almost insensible at all times, and frequentlywholly so--my father took great pains to find some relief; and asthe physicians who attended me had none to give, he had me takento a place which had a great reputation for the cure of otherinfirmities.  They said I should find relief there. [6]That friend of whom I have spoken as being in the house went withme. She was one of the elder nuns.  In the house where I was anun, there was no vow of enclosure. [7]7. I remained there nearly a year, for three months of itsuffering most cruel tortures--effects of the violent remedieswhich they applied.  I know not how I endured them; and indeed,though I submitted myself to them, they were, as I shallrelate, [8] more than my constitution could bear.8. I was to begin the treatment in the spring, and went thitherwhen winter commenced.  The intervening time I spent with mysister, of whom I spoke before, [9] in her house in the country,waiting for the month of April, which was drawing near, that Imight not have to go and return.  The uncle of whom I have mademention before, [10] and whose house was on our road, gave me abook called Tercer Abecedario, [11] which treats of the prayer ofrecollection.  Though in the first year I had read goodbooks--for I would read no others, because I understood now theharm they had done me--I did not know how to make my prayer, norhow to recollect myself.  I was therefore much pleased with thebook, and resolved to follow the way of prayer it described withall my might.  And as our Lord had already bestowed upon me thegift of tears, and I found pleasure in reading, I began to spenda certain time in solitude, to go frequently to confession, andmake a beginning of that way of prayer, with this book for myguide; for I had no master--I mean, no confessor--who understoodme, though I sought for such a one for twenty years afterwards:which did me much harm, in that I frequently went backwards, andmight have been even utterly lost; for, anyhow, a director wouldhave helped me to escape the risks I ran of sinning against God.9. From the very beginning, God was most gracious unto me.Though I was not so free from sin as the book required, I passedthat by; such watchfulness seemed to me almost impossible.  I wason my guard against mortal sin--and would to God I had alwaysbeen so!--but I was careless about venial sins, and that was myruin.  Yet, for all this, at the end of my stay there--I spentnearly nine months in the practice of solitude--our Lord began tocomfort me so much in this way of prayer, as in His mercy toraise me to the prayer of quiet, and now and then to that ofunion, though I understood not what either the one or the otherwas, nor the great esteem I ought to have had of them.  I believeit would have been a great blessing to me if I had understood thematter.  It is true that the prayer of union lasted but a shorttime: I know not if it continued for the space of an Ave Maria;but the fruits of it remained; and they were such that, though Iwas then not twenty years of age, I seemed to despise the worldutterly; and so I remember how sorry I was for those who followedits ways, though only in things lawful.10. I used to labour with all my might to imagine Jesus Christ,our Good and our Lord, present within me.  And this was the way Iprayed.  If I meditated on any mystery of His life, I representedit to myself as within me, though the greater part of my time Ispent in reading good books, which was all my comfort; for Godnever endowed me with the gift of making reflections with theunderstanding, or with that of using the imagination to any goodpurpose: my imagination is so sluggish, [12] that even if I wouldthink of, or picture to myself, as I used to labour to picture,our Lord's Humanity, I never could do it.11. And though men may attain more quickly to the state ofcontemplation, if they persevere, by this way of inability toexert the intellect, yet is the process more laborious andpainful; for if the will have nothing to occupy it, and if lovehave no present object to rest on, the soul is without supportand without employment--its isolation and dryness occasion greatpain, and the thoughts assail it most grievously.  Persons inthis condition must have greater purity of conscience than thosewho can make use of their understanding; for he who can use hisintellect in the way of meditation on what the world is, on whathe owes to God, on the great sufferings of God for him, his ownscanty service in return, and on the reward God reserves forthose who love Him, learns how to defend himself against his ownthoughts, and against the occasions and perils of sin.  On theother hand, he who has not that power is in greater danger, andought to occupy himself much in reading, seeing that he is not inthe slightest degree able to help himself.12. This way of proceeding is so exceedingly painful, that if themaster who teaches it insists on cutting off the succours whichreading gives, and requires the spending of much time in prayer,then, I say, it will be impossible to persevere long in it: andif he persists in his plan, health will be ruined, because it isa most painful process.  Reading is of great service towardsprocuring recollection in any one who proceeds in this way; andit is even necessary for him, however little it may be that hereads, if only as a substitute for the mental prayer which isbeyond his reach.13. Now I seem to understand that it was the good providence ofour Lord over me that found no one to teach me.  If I had, itwould have been impossible for me to persevere during theeighteen years of my trial and of those great aridities becauseof my inability to meditate.  During all this time, it was onlyafter Communion that I ever ventured to begin my prayer without abook--my soul was as much afraid to pray without one, as if ithad to fight against a host.  With a book to help me--it was likea companion, and a shield whereon to receive the blows of manythoughts--I found comfort; for it was not usual with me to be inaridity: but I always was so when I had no book; for my soul wasdisturbed, and my thoughts wandered at once.  With one, I beganto collect my thoughts, and, using it as a decoy, kept my soul inpeace, very frequently by merely opening a book--there was nonecessity for more.  Sometimes, I read but little; at othertimes, much--according as our Lord had pity on me.14. It seemed to me, in these beginnings of which I am speaking,that there could be no danger capable of withdrawing me from sogreat a blessing, if I had but books, and could have remainedalone; and I believe that, by the grace of God, it would havebeen so, if I had had a master or any one to warn me againstthose occasions of sin in the beginning, and, if I fell, to bringme quickly out of them.  If the devil had assailed me openlythen, I believe I should never have fallen into any grievous sin;but he was so subtle, and I so weak, that all my good resolutionswere of little service--though, in those days in which I servedGod, they were very profitable in enabling me, with that patiencewhich His Majesty gave me, to endure the alarming illnesses whichI had to bear.  I have often thought with wonder of the greatgoodness of God; and my soul has rejoiced in the contemplation ofHis great magnificence and mercy.  May He be blessed forever!--for I see clearly that He has not omitted to reward me,even in this life, for every one of my good desires.  My goodworks, however wretched and imperfect, have been made better andperfected by Him Who is my Lord: He has rendered themmeritorious.  As to my evil deeds and my sins, He hid them atonce.  The eyes of those who saw them, He made even blind; and Hehas blotted them out of their memory.  He gilds my faults, makesvirtue to shine forth, giving it to me Himself, and compelling meto possess it, as it were, by force.15. I must now return to that which has been enjoined me.  I say,that if I had to describe minutely how our Lord dealt with me inthe beginning, it would be necessary for me to have anotherunderstanding than that I have: so that I might be able toappreciate what I owe to Him, together with my own ingratitudeand wickedness; for I have forgotten it all.May He be blessed for ever Who has borne with me so long!  Amen.1. Antonio de Ahumada; who, according to the most probableopinion, entered the Dominican monastery of St. Thomas, Avila.It is said that he died before he was professed.

Her father took her from the monastery in the autumn of 1535,according to the Bollandists, but of 1538, according to thechronicler, who adds, that she was taken to her uncle'shouse--Pedro Sanchez de Cepeda--in Hortigosa, and then toCastellanos de la Cañada, to the house of her sister, Doña Maria,where she remained till the spring, when she went to Bezadas forher cure (Reforma, lib. i. ch. xi. § 2).7.

ISFJ	 V.Illness and Patience of the Saint.  The Story of a Priest WhomShe Rescued from a Life of Sin.1. I forgot to say how, in the year of my novitiate, I sufferedmuch uneasiness about things in themselves of no importance; butI was found fault with very often when I was blameless.  I boreit painfully and with imperfection; however, I went through itall, because of the joy I had in being a nun.  When they saw meseeking to be alone, and even weeping over my sins at times, theythought I was discontented, and said so.2. All religious observances had an attraction for me, but Icould not endure any which seemed to make me contemptible.I delighted in being thought well of by others, and was veryexact in everything I had to do.  All this I thought was avirtue, though it will not serve as any excuse for me, because Iknew what it was to procure my own satisfaction in everything,and so ignorance does not blot out the blame.  There may be someexcuse in the fact that the monastery was not founded in greatperfection.  I, wicked as I was, followed after that which I sawwas wrong, and neglected that which was good.3. There was then in the house a nun labouring under a mostgrievous and painful disorder, for there were open ulcers in herbody, caused by certain obstructions, through which her food wasrejected.  Of this sickness she soon died.  All the sisters, Isaw, were afraid of her malady.  I envied her patience very much;I prayed to God that He would give me a like patience; and then,whatever sickness it might be His pleasure to send, I do notthink I was afraid of any, for I was resolved on gaining eternalgood, and determined to gain it by any and by every means.4. I am surprised at myself, because then I had not, as Ibelieve, that love of God which I think I had after I began topray.  Then, I had only light to see that all things that passaway are to be lightly esteemed, and that the good things to begained by despising them are of great price, because they are forever.  His Majesty heard me also in this, for in less than twoyears I was so afflicted myself that the illness which I had,though of a different kind from that of the sister, was, I reallybelieve, not less painful and trying for the three years itlasted, as I shall now relate.5. When the time had come for which I was waiting in the place Ispoke of before [1]--I was in my sister's house, for the purposeof undergoing the medical treatment--they took me away with theutmost care of my comfort; that is, my father, my sister, and thenun, my friend, who had come from the monastery with me,--for herlove for me was very great.  At that moment, Satan began totrouble my soul; God, however, brought forth a great blessing outof that trouble.6. In the place to which I had gone for my cure lived a priest ofgood birth and understanding, with some learning, but not much.I went to confession to him, for I was always fond of learnedmen, although confessors indifferently learned did my soul muchharm; for I did not always find confessors whose learning was asgood as I could wish it was.  I know by experience that it isbetter, if the confessors are good men and of holy lives, thatthey should have no learning at all, than a little; for suchconfessors never trust themselves without consulting those whoare learned--nor would I trust them myself: and a really learnedconfessor never deceived me. [2]  Neither did the otherswillingly deceive me, only they knew no better; I thought theywere learned, and that I was not under any other obligation thanthat of believing them, as their instructions to me were lax, andleft me more at liberty--for if they had been strict with me, Iam so wicked, I should have sought for others. That which was avenial sin, they told me was no sin at all; of that which wasmost grievously mortal, they said it was venial. [3]7. This did me so much harm, that it is no wonder I should speakof it here as a warning to others, that they may avoid an evil sogreat; for I see clearly that in the eyes of God I was withoutexcuse, that the things I did being in themselves not good, thisshould have been enough to keep me from them.  I believe thatGod, by reason of my sins, allowed those confessors to deceivethemselves and to deceive me.  I myself deceived many others bysaying to them what had been said to me.8. I continued in this blindness, I believe, more than seventeenyears, till a most learned Dominican Father [4] undeceived me inpart, and those of the Company of Jesus made me altogether soafraid, by insisting on the erroneousness of these principles, asI shall hereafter show. [5]9. I began, then, by going to confession to that priest of whom Ispoke before. [6]  He took an extreme liking to me, because I hadthen but little to confess in comparison with what I hadafterwards; and I had never much to say since I became a nun.There was no harm in the liking he had for me, but it ceased tobe good, because it was in excess.  He clearly understood that Iwas determined on no account whatever to do anything whereby Godmight be seriously offended.  He, too, gave me a like assuranceabout himself, and accordingly our conferences were many.  But atthat time, through the knowledge and fear of God which filled mysoul, what gave me most pleasure in all my conversations withothers was to speak of God; and, as I was so young, this made himashamed; and then, out of that great goodwill he bore me, hebegan to tell me of his wretched state.  It was very sad, for hehad been nearly seven years in a most perilous condition, becauseof his affection for, and conversation with, a woman of thatplace; and yet he used to say Mass.  The matter was so public,that his honour and good name were lost, and no one ventured tospeak to him about it.  I was extremely sorry for him, because Iliked him much.  I was then so imprudent and so blind as to thinkit a virtue to be grateful and loyal to one who liked me.Cursed be that loyalty which reaches so far as to go against thelaw of God.  It is a madness common in the world, and it makes memad to see it.  We are indebted to God for all the good that mendo to us, and yet we hold it to be an act of virtue not to breaka friendship of this kind, though it lead us to go against Him.Oh, blindness of the world!  Let me, O Lord, be most ungratefulto the world; never at all unto Thee.  But I have been altogetherotherwise through my sins.10. I procured further information about the matter from membersof his household; I learned more of his ruinous state, and sawthat the poor man's fault was not so grave, because the miserablewoman had had recourse to enchantments, by giving him a littleimage made of copper, which she had begged him to wear for loveof her around his neck; and this no one had influence enough topersuade him to throw away.  As to this matter of enchantments, Ido not believe it to be altogether true; but I will relate what Isaw, by way of warning to men to be on their guard against womenwho will do things of this kind.  And let them be assured ofthis, that women--for they are more bound to purity than men--ifonce they have lost all shame before God, are in nothing whateverto be trusted; and that in exchange for the gratification oftheir will, and of that affection which the devil suggests, theywill hesitate at nothing.11. Though I have been so wicked myself, I never fell intoanything of this kind, nor did I ever attempt to do evil; nor, ifI had the power, would I have ever constrained any one to likeme, for our Lord kept me from this.  But if He had abandoned me,I should have done wrong in this, as I did in other things--forthere is nothing in me whereon anyone may rely.12. When I knew this, I began to show him greater affection: myintention was good, but the act was wrong, for I ought not to dothe least wrong for the sake of any good, how great soever it maybe.  I spoke to him most frequently of God; and this must havedone him good--though I believe that what touched him most washis great affection for me, because, to do me a pleasure, he gaveme that little image of copper, and I had it at once thrown intoa river.  When he had given it up, like a man roused from deepsleep, he began to consider all that he had done in those years;and then, amazed at himself, lamenting his ruinous state, thatwoman came to be hateful in his eyes.  Our Lady must have helpedhim greatly, for he had a very great devotion to her Conception,and used to keep the feast thereof with great solemnity.In short, he broke off all relations with that woman utterly, andwas never weary of giving God thanks for the light He had givenhim; and at the end of the year from the day I first saw him,he died.13. He had been most diligent in the service of God; and as forthat great affection he had for me, I never observed anythingwrong in it, though it might have been of greater purity.There were also occasions wherein he might have most grievouslyoffended, if he had not kept himself in the near presence of God.As I said before, [7] I would not then have done anything I knewwas a mortal sin.  And I think that observing this resolution inme helped him to have that affection for me; for I believe thatall men must have a greater affection for those women whom theysee disposed to be good; and even for the attainment of earthlyends, women must have more power over men because they are good,as I shall show hereafter.  I am convinced that the priest is inthe way of salvation.  He died most piously, and completelywithdrawn from that occasion of sin.  It seems that it was thewill of our Lord he should be saved by these means.14. I remained three months in that place, in the most grievoussufferings; for the treatment was too severe for my constitution.In two months--so strong were the medicines--my life was nearlyworn out; and the severity of the pain in the heart, [8] for thecure of which I was there was much more keen: it seemed to me,now and then, as if it had been seized by sharp teeth.  So greatwas the torment, that it was feared it might end in madness.There was a great loss of strength, for I could eat nothingwhatever, only drink.  I had a great loathing for food, and afever that never left me.  I was so reduced, for they had givenme purgatives daily for nearly a month, and so parched up, thatmy sinews began to shrink.  The pains I had were unendurable, andI was overwhelmed in a most deep sadness, so that I had no resteither night or day.15. This was the result; and thereupon my father took me back.Then the physicians visited me again.  All gave me up; they saidI was also consumptive.  This gave me little or no concern; whatdistressed me were the pains I had--for I was in pain from myhead down to my feet.  Now, nervous pains, according to thephysicians, are intolerable; and all my nerves were shrunk.Certainly, if I had not brought this upon myself by my sins, thetorture would have been unendurable.16. I was not more than three months in this cruel distress, forit seemed impossible that so many ills could be borne together.I now am astonished at myself, and the patience His Majesty gaveme--for it clearly came from Him--I look upon as a great mercy ofour Lord.  It was a great help to me to be patient, that I hadread the story of Job, in the Morals of St. Gregory (our Lordseems to have prepared me thereby); and that I had begun thepractice of prayer, so that I might bear it all, conforming mywill to the will of God.  All my conversation was with God.I had continually these words of Job in my thoughts and in mymouth: 'If we have received good things of the hand of our Lord,why should we not receive evil things?' [9]  This seemed to giveme courage.17. The feast of our Lady, in August, came round; from Apriluntil then I had been in great pain, but more especially duringthe last three months.  I made haste to go to confession, for Ihad always been very fond of frequent confession.  They thought Iwas driven by the fear of death; and so my father, in order toquiet me, would not suffer me to go.  Oh, the unreasonable loveof flesh and blood!  Though it was that of a father so Catholicand so wise--he was very much so, and this act of his could notbe the effect of any ignorance on his part--what evil it mighthave done me!18. That very night my sickness became so acute, that for aboutfour days I remained insensible.  They administered the Sacramentof the last Anointing, and every hour, or rather every moment,thought I was dying; they did nothing but repeat the Credo, as ifI could have understood anything they said.  They must haveregarded me as dead more than once, for I found afterwards dropsof wax on my eyelids.  My father, because he had not allowed meto go to confession, was grievously distressed.  Loud cries andmany prayers were made to God: blessed be He Who heard them.19. For a day-and-a-half the grave was open in my monastery,waiting for my body; [10] and the Friars of our Order, in a houseat some distance from this place, performed funeral solemnities.But it pleased our Lord I should come to myself.  I wished to goto confession at once.  I communicated with many tears; but I donot think those tears had their source in that pain and sorrowonly for having offended God, which might have sufficed for mysalvation--unless, indeed, the delusion which I laboured underwere some excuse for me, and into which I had been led by thosewho had told me that some things were not mortal sins whichafterwards I found were so certainly.20. Though my sufferings were unendurable, and my perceptionsdull, yet my confession, I believe, was complete as to allmatters wherein I understood myself to have offended God. Thisgrace, among others, did His Majesty bestow on me, that eversince my first Communion never in confession have I failed toconfess anything I thought to be a sin, though it might be only avenial sin.  But I think that undoubtedly my salvation was ingreat peril, if I had died at that time--partly because myconfessors were so unlearned, and partly because I was so verywicked.  It is certainly true that when I think of it, andconsider how our Lord seems to have raised me up from the dead, Iam so filled with wonder, that I almost tremble with fear. [11]21. And now, O my soul, it were well for thee to look that dangerin the face from which our Lord delivered thee; and if thou dostnot cease to offend Him out of love thou shouldst do so out offear.  He might have slain thee a thousand times, and in a farmore perilous state.  I believe I exaggerate nothing if I say athousand times again, though he may rebuke me who has commandedme to restrain myself in recounting my sins; and they are glossedover enough. I pray him, for the love of God, not to suppress oneof my faults, because herein shines forth the magnificence ofGod, as well as His long-suffering towards souls.  May He beblessed for evermore, and destroy me utterly, rather than let mecease to love Him any more!1. Ch. iv. § 6.

ISFJ	 VI.The Great Debt She Owed to Our Lord for His Mercy to Her.She Takes St. Joseph for Her Patron.1. After those four days, during which I was insensible, so greatwas my distress, that our Lord alone knoweth the intolerablesufferings I endured.  My tongue was bitten to pieces; there wasa choking in my throat because I had taken nothing, and becauseof my weakness, so that I could not swallow even a drop of water;all my bones seemed to be out of joint, and the disorder of myhead was extreme.  I was bent together like a coil of ropes--forto this was I brought by the torture of those days--unable tomove either arm, or foot, or hand, or head, any more than if Ihad been dead, unless others moved me; I could move, however, Ithink, one finger of my right hand.  Then, as to touching me,that was impossible, for I was so bruised that I could not endureit.  They used to move me in a sheet, one holding one end, andanother the other.  This lasted till Palm Sunday. [1]2. The only comfort I had was this--if no one came near me, mypains frequently ceased; and then, because I had a little rest, Iconsidered myself well, for I was afraid my patience would fail:and thus I was exceedingly happy when I saw myself free fromthose pains which were so sharp and constant, though in the coldfits of an intermittent fever, which were most violent, they werestill unendurable.  My dislike of food was very great.3. I was now so anxious to return to my monastery, that I hadmyself conveyed thither in the state I was in.  There theyreceived alive one whom they had waited for as dead; but her bodywas worse than dead: the sight of it could only give pain.  It isimpossible to describe my extreme weakness, for I was nothing butbones.  I remained in this state, as I have already said, [2]more than eight months; and was paralytic, though getting better,for about three years.  I praised God when I began to crawl on myhands and knees.  I bore all this with great resignation, and, ifI except the beginning of my illness, with great joy; for allthis was as nothing in comparison with the pains and tortures Ihad to bear at first.  I was resigned to the will of God, even ifHe left me in this state for ever.  My anxiety about the recoveryof my health seemed to be grounded on my desire to pray insolitude, as I had been taught; for there were no means of doingso in the infirmary.  I went to confession most frequently, spokemuch about God, and in such a way as to edify everyone; and theyall marvelled at the patience which our Lord gave me--for if ithad not come from the hand of His Majesty, it seemed impossibleto endure so great an affliction with so great a joy.4. It was a great thing for me to have had the grace of prayerwhich God had wrought in me; it made me understand what it is tolove Him.  In a little while, I saw these virtues renewed withinme; still they were not strong, for they were not sufficient tosustain me in justice.  I never spoke ill in the slightest degreewhatever of any one, and my ordinary practice was to avoid alldetraction; for I used to keep most carefully in mind that Iought not to assent to, nor say of another, anything I should notlike to have said of myself.  I was extremely careful to keepthis resolution on all occasions though not so perfectly, uponsome great occasions that presented themselves, as not to breakit sometimes.  But my ordinary practice was this: and thus thosewho were about me, and those with whom I conversed, became soconvinced that it was right, that they adopted it as a habit.It came to be understood that where I was, absent persons weresafe; so they were also with my friends and kindred, and withthose whom I instructed.  Still, for all this, I have a strictaccount to give unto God for the bad example I gave in otherrespects. May it please His Majesty to forgive me, for I havebeen the cause of much evil; though not with intentions asperverse as were the acts that followed.5. The longing for solitude remained, and I loved to discourseand speak of God; for if I found any one with whom I could do so,it was a greater joy and satisfaction to me than all therefinements--or rather to speak more correctly, the realrudeness--of the world's conversation.  I communicated andconfessed more frequently still, and desired to do so; I wasextremely fond of reading good books; I was most deeply penitentfor having offended God; and I remember that very often I did notdare to pray, because I was afraid of that most bitter anguishwhich I felt for having offended God, dreading it as a greatchastisement.  This grew upon me afterwards to so great a degree,that I know of no torment wherewith to compare it; and yet it wasneither more nor less because of any fear I had at any time, forit came upon me only when I remembered the consolations of ourLord which He gave me in prayer, the great debt I owed Him, theevil return I made: I could not bear it.  I was also extremelyangry with myself on account of the many tears I shed for myfaults, when I saw how little I improved, seeing that neither mygood resolutions, nor the pains I took, were sufficient to keepme from falling whenever I had the opportunity.  I looked on mytears as a delusion; and my faults, therefore, I regarded as themore grievous, because I saw the great goodness of our Lord to mein the shedding of those tears, and together with them suchdeep compunction.6. I took care to go to confession as soon as I could; and, as Ithink, did all that was possible on my part to return to a stateof grace.  But the whole evil lay in my not thoroughly avoidingthe occasions of sin, and in my confessors, who helped me solittle.  If they had told me that I was travelling on a dangerousroad, and that I was bound to abstain from those conversations, Ibelieve, without any doubt, that the matter would have beenremedied, because I could not bear to remain even for one day inmortal sin, if I knew it.7. All these tokens of the fear of God came to me through prayer;and the greatest of them was this, that fear was swallowed up oflove--for I never thought of chastisement.  All the time I was soill, my strict watch over my conscience reached to all that ismortal sin.8. O my God! I wished for health, that I might serve Thee better;that was the cause of all my ruin.  For when I saw how helpless Iwas through paralysis, being still so young, and how thephysicians of this world had dealt with me, I determined to askthose of heaven to heal me--for I wished, nevertheless, to bewell, though I bore my illness with great joy.  Sometimes, too, Iused to think that if I recovered my health, and yet were lostfor ever, I was better as I was.  But, for all that, I thought Imight serve God much better if I were well.  This is ourdelusion; we do not resign ourselves absolutely to thedisposition of our Lord, Who knows best what is for our good.9. I began by having Masses and prayers said for myintention--prayers that were highly sanctioned; for I never likedthose other devotions which some people, especially women, makeuse of with a ceremoniousness to me intolerable, but which movethem to be devout.  I have been given to understand since thatthey were unseemly and superstitious; and I took for my patronand lord the glorious St. Joseph, and recommended myselfearnestly to him.  I saw clearly that both out of this my presenttrouble, and out of others of greater importance, relating to myhonour and the loss of my soul, this my father and lord deliveredme, and rendered me greater services than I knew how to ask for.I cannot call to mind that I have ever asked him at any time foranything which he has not granted; and I am filled with amazementwhen I consider the great favours which God hath given me throughthis blessed Saint; the dangers from which he hath delivered me,both of body and of soul.  To other Saints, our Lord seems tohave given grace to succour men in some special necessity; but tothis glorious Saint, I know by experience, to help us in all: andour Lord would have us understand that as He was Himself subjectto him upon earth--for St. Joseph having the title of father, andbeing His guardian, could command Him--so now in heaven Heperforms all his petitions.  I have asked others to recommendthemselves to St. Joseph, and they too know this by experience;and there are many who are now of late devout to him, [3] havinghad experience of this truth.10. I used to keep his feast with all the solemnity I could, butwith more vanity than spirituality, seeking rather too muchsplendour and effect, and yet with good intentions.  I had thisevil in me, that if our Lord gave me grace to do any good, thatgood became full of imperfections and of many faults; but as fordoing wrong, the indulgence of curiosity and vanity, I was veryskilful and active therein.  Our Lord forgive me!11. Would that I could persuade all men to be devout to thisglorious Saint; for I know by long experience what blessings hecan obtain for us from God.  I have never known any one who wasreally devout to him, and who honoured him by particularservices, who did not visibly grow more and more in virtue; forhe helps in a special way those souls who commend themselves tohim.  It is now some years since I have always on his feast askedhim for something, and I always have it.  If the petition be inany way amiss, he directs it aright for my greater good.12. If I were a person who had authority to write, it would be apleasure to me to be diffusive in speaking most minutely of thegraces which this glorious Saint has obtained for me and forothers.  But that I may not go beyond the commandment that islaid upon me, I must in many things be more brief than I couldwish, and more diffusive than is necessary in others; for, inshort, I am a person who, in all that is good, has but littlediscretion.  But I ask, for the love of God, that he who does notbelieve me will make the trial for himself--when he will see byexperience the great good that results from commending oneself tothis glorious patriarch, and being devout to him.  Those who givethemselves to prayer should in a special manner have always adevotion to St. Joseph; for I know not how any man can think ofthe Queen of the angels, during the time that she suffered somuch with the Infant Jesus, without giving thanks to St. Josephfor the services he rendered them then.  He who cannot find anyone to teach him how to pray, let him take this glorious Saintfor his master, and he will not wander out of the way.13. May it please our Lord that I have not done amiss inventuring to speak about St. Joseph; for, though I publiclyprofess my devotion to him, I have always failed in my service tohim and imitation of him.  He was like himself when he made meable to rise and walk, no longer a paralytic; and I, too, am likemyself when I make so bad a use of this grace.14. Who could have said that I was so soon to fall, after suchgreat consolations from God--after His Majesty had implantedvirtues in me which of themselves made me serve Him--after I hadbeen, as it were, dead, and in such extreme peril of eternaldamnation--after He had raised me up, soul and body, so that allwho saw me marvelled to see me alive?  What can it mean, O myLord?  The life we live is so full of danger!  While I am writingthis--and it seems to me, too, by Thy grace and mercy--I may saywith St. Paul, though not so truly as he did: 'It is not I wholive now, but Thou, my Creator, livest in me.' [4]  For someyears past, so it seems to me, Thou hast held me by the hand; andI see in myself desires and resolutions--in some measure testedby experience, in many ways, during that time--never to doanything, however slight it may be, contrary to Thy will, thoughI must have frequently offended Thy Divine Majesty without beingaware of it; and I also think that nothing can be proposed to methat I should not with great resolution undertake for Thy love.In some things Thou hast Thyself helped me to succeed therein.I love neither the world, nor the things of the world; nor do Ibelieve that anything that does not come from Thee can give mepleasure; everything else seems to me a heavy cross.15. Still, I may easily deceive myself, and it may be that I amnot what I say I am; but Thou knowest, O my Lord, that, to thebest of my knowledge, I lie not.  I am afraid, and with goodreason, lest Thou shouldst abandon me; for I know now how far mystrength and little virtue can reach, if Thou be not ever at handto supply them, and to help me never to forsake Thee.  May HisMajesty grant that I be not forsaken of Thee even now, when I amthinking all this of myself!16. I know not how we can wish to live, seeing that everything isso uncertain.  Once, O Lord, I thought it impossible to forsakeThee so utterly; and now that I have forsaken Thee so often, Icannot help being afraid; for when Thou didst withdraw but alittle from me, I fell down to the ground at once.  Blessed forever be Thou!  Though I have forsaken Thee, Thou hast notforsaken me so utterly but that Thou hast come again and raisedme up, giving me Thy hand always.  Very often, O Lord, I wouldnot take it: very often I would not listen when Thou wert callingme again, as I am going to show.1. March 25, 1537.2. Ch. v. § 17.  The Saint left her monastery in 1535; and in thespring of 1536 went from her sister's house to Bezadas; and inJuly of that year was brought back to her father's house inAvila, wherein she remained till Palm Sunday, 1537, when shereturned to the Monastery of the Incarnation.  She had beenseized with paralysis there, and laboured under it nearly threeyears, from 1536 to 1539, when she was miraculously healedthrough the intercession of St. Joseph (Bolland, n. 100, 101).The dates of the Chronicler are different from these.3. Of the devotion to St. Joseph, F. Faber (The BlessedSacrament, bk. ii. p. 199, 3rd ed.) says that it took its rise inthe West, in a confraternity in Avignon.  'Then it spread overthe church. Gerson was raised up to be its doctor and theologian,and St. Teresa to be its Saint, and St. Francis of Sales to beits popular teacher and missionary.  The houses of Carmel werelike the holy house of Nazareth to it; and the colleges of theJesuits, its peaceful sojourns in dark Egypt.'4. Galat. ii. 20: 'Vivo autem, jam non ego; vivit vero inme Christus.'
ISFJ	 VII.Lukewarmness.  The Loss of Grace.  Inconvenience of Laxity inReligious Houses.1. So, then, going on from pastime to pastime, from vanity tovanity, from one occasion of sin to another, I began to exposemyself exceedingly to the very greatest dangers: my soul was sodistracted by many vanities, that I was ashamed to draw near untoGod in an act of such special friendship as that of prayer. [1]As my sins multiplied, I began to lose the pleasure and comfort Ihad in virtuous things: and that loss contributed to theabandonment of prayer.  I see now most clearly, O my Lord, thatthis comfort departed from me because I had departed from Thee.2. It was the most fearful delusion into which Satan could plungeme--to give up prayer under the pretence of humility.  I began tobe afraid of giving myself to prayer, because I saw myself solost.  I thought it would be better for me, seeing that in mywickedness I was one of the most wicked, to live like themultitude--to say the prayers which I was bound to say, and thatvocally: not to practise mental prayer nor commune with God somuch; for I deserved to be with the devils, and was deceivingthose who were about me, because I made an outward show ofgoodness; and therefore the community in which I dwelt is not tobe blamed; for with my cunning I so managed matters, that all hada good opinion of me; and yet I did not seek this deliberately bysimulating devotion; for in all that relates to hypocrisy andostentation--glory be to God!--I do not remember that I everoffended Him, [2] so far as I know.  The very first movementsherein gave me such pain, that the devil would depart from mewith loss, and the gain remained with me; and thus, accordingly,he never tempted me much in this way.  Perhaps, however, if Godhad permitted Satan to tempt me as sharply herein as he temptedme in other things, I should have fallen also into this; but HisMajesty has preserved me until now.  May He be blessed forevermore!  It was rather a heavy affliction to me that I shouldbe thought so well of; for I knew my own secret.3. The reason why they thought I was not so wicked was this: theysaw that I, who was so young, and exposed to so many occasions ofsin, withdrew myself so often into solitude for prayer, readmuch, spoke of God, that I liked to have His image painted inmany places, to have an oratory of my own, and furnish it withobjects of devotion, that I spoke ill of no one, and other thingsof the same kind in me which have the appearance of virtue.  Yetall the while--I was so vain--I knew how to procure respect formyself by doing those things which in the world are usuallyregarded with respect.4. In consequence of this, they gave me as much liberty as theydid to the oldest nuns, and even more, and had great confidencein me; for as to taking any liberty for myself, or doing anythingwithout leave--such as conversing through the door, or in secret,or by night--I do not think I could have brought myself to speakwith anybody in the monastery in that way, and I never did it;for our Lord held me back.  It seemed to me--for I consideredmany things carefully and of set purpose--that it would be a veryevil deed on my part, wicked as I was, to risk the credit of somany nuns, who were all good--as if everything else I did waswell done!  In truth, the evil I did was not the result ofdeliberation, as this would have been, if I had done it, althoughit was too much so.5. Therefore, I think that it did me much harm to be in amonastery not enclosed.  The liberty which those who were goodmight have with advantage--they not being obliged to do more thanthey do, because they had not bound themselves toenclosure--would certainly have led me, who am wicked, straightto hell, if our Lord, by so many remedies and means of His mostsingular mercy, had not delivered me out of that danger--and itis, I believe, the very greatest danger--namely, a monastery ofwomen unenclosed--yea, more, I think it is, for those who will bewicked, a road to hell, rather than a help to their weakness.This is not to be understood of my monastery; for there are somany there who in the utmost sincerity, and in great perfection,serve our Lord, so that His Majesty, according to His goodness,cannot but be gracious unto them; neither is it one of thosewhich are most open for all religious observances are kept in it;and I am speaking only of others which I have seen and known.6. I am exceedingly sorry for these houses, because our Lord mustof necessity send His special inspirations not merely once, butmany times, if the nuns therein are to be saved, seeing that thehonours and amusements of the world are allowed among them, andthe obligations of their state are so ill-understood.  God grantthey may not count that to be virtue which is sin, as I did sooften!  It is very difficult to make people understand this; itis necessary our Lord Himself should take the matter seriouslyinto His own hands.7. If parents would take my advice, now that they are at no painsto place their daughters where they may walk in the way ofsalvation without incurring a greater risk than they would do ifthey were left in the world, let them look at least at that whichconcerns their good name.  Let them marry them to persons of amuch lower degree, rather than place them in monasteries of thiskind, unless they be of extremely good inclinations, and Godgrant that these inclinations may come to good! or let them keepthem at home.  If they will be wicked at home, their evil lifecan be hidden only for a short time; but in monasteries it can behidden long, and, in the end, it is our Lord that discovers it.They injure not only themselves, but all the nuns also.  And allthe while the poor things are not in fault; for they walk in theway that is shown them.  Many of them are to be pitied; for theywished to withdraw from the world, and, thinking to escape fromthe dangers of it, and that they were going to serve our Lord,have found themselves in ten worlds at once, without knowing whatto do, or how to help themselves.  Youth and sensuality and thedevil invite them and incline them to follow certain ways whichare of the essence of worldliness.  They see these ways, so tospeak, considered as safe there.8. Now, these seem to me to be in some degree like those wretchedheretics who will make themselves blind, and who will considerthat which they do to be good, and so believe, but without reallybelieving; for they have within themselves something that tellsthem it is wrong.9. Oh, what utter ruin! utter ruin of religious persons--I am notspeaking now more of women than of men--where the rules of theOrder are not kept; where the same monastery offers two roads:one of virtue and observance, the other of inobservance, and bothequally frequented!  I have spoken incorrectly: they are notequally frequented; for, on account of our sins, the way of thegreatest imperfection is the most frequented; and because it isthe broadest, it is also the most in favour.  The way ofreligious observance is so little used, that the friar and thenun who would really begin to follow their vocation thoroughlyhave reason to fear the members of their communities more thanall the devils together.  They must be more cautious, anddissemble more, when they would speak of that friendship with Godwhich they desire to have, than when they would speak of thosefriendships and affections which the devil arranges inmonasteries.  I know not why we are astonished that the Church isin so much trouble, when we see those, who ought to be an exampleof every virtue to others, so disfigure the work which the spiritof the Saints departed wrought in their Orders.  May it pleaseHis Divine Majesty to apply a remedy to this, as He sees it to beneedful!  Amen.10. So, then, when I began to indulge in these conversations, Idid not think, seeing they were customary, that my soul must beinjured and dissipated, as I afterwards found it must be, by suchconversations.  I thought that, as receiving visits was so commonin many monasteries, no more harm would befall me thereby thanbefell others, whom I knew to be good.  I did not observe thatthey were much better than I was, and that an act which wasperilous for me was not so perilous for them; and yet I have nodoubt there was some danger in it, were it nothing else but awaste of time.11. I was once with a person--it was at the very beginning of myacquaintance with her when our Lord was pleased to show me thatthese friendships were not good for me: to warn me also, and inmy blindness, which was so great, to give me light.  Christ stoodbefore me, stern and grave, giving me to understand what in myconduct was offensive to Him.  I saw Him with the eyes of thesoul more distinctly than I could have seen Him with the eyes ofthe body.  The vision made so deep an impression upon me, that,though it is more than twenty-six years ago, [3] I seem to seeHim present even now.  I was greatly astonished and disturbed,and I resolved not to see that person again.12. It did me much harm that I did not then know it was possibleto see anything otherwise than with the eyes of the body; [4] sodid Satan too, in that he helped me to think so: he made meunderstand it to be impossible, and suggested that I had imaginedthe vision--that it might be Satan himself--and othersuppositions of that kind.  For all this, the impression remainedwith me that the vision was from God, and not an imagination;but, as it was not to my liking, I forced myself to lie tomyself; and as I did not dare to discuss the matter with any one,and as great importunity was used, I went back to my formerconversation with the same person, and with others also, atdifferent times; for I was assured that there was no harm inseeing such a person, and that I gained, instead of losing,reputation by doing so.  I spent many years in this pestilentamusement; for it never appeared to me, when I was engaged in it,to be so bad as it really was, though at times I saw clearly itwas not good.  But no one caused me the same distraction whichthat person did of whom I am speaking; and that was because I hada great affection for her.13. At another time, when I was with that person, we saw, both ofus, and others who were present also saw, something like a greattoad crawling towards us, more rapidly than such a creature is inthe habit of crawling.  I cannot understand how a reptile of thatkind could, in the middle of the day, have come forth from thatplace; it never had done so before, [5] but the impression itmade on me was such, that I think it must have had a meaning;neither have I ever forgotten it.  Oh, the greatness of God! withwhat care and tenderness didst Thou warn me in every way! and howlittle I profited by those warnings!14. There was in that house a nun, who was related to me, nowgrown old, a great servant of God, and a strict observer of therule.  She too warned me from time to time; but I not only didnot listen to her, but was even offended, thinking she wasscandalized without cause.  I have mentioned this in order thatmy wickedness and the great goodness of God might be understood,and to show how much I deserved hell for ingratitude so great,and, moreover, if it should be our Lord's will and pleasure thatany nun at any time should read this, that she might take warningby me.  I beseech them all, for the love of our Lord, to fleefrom such recreations as these.15. May His Majesty grant I may undeceive some one of the many Iled astray when I told them there was no harm in these things,and assured them there was no such great danger therein. I did sobecause I was blind myself; for I would not deliberately leadthem astray.  By the bad example I set before them--I spoke ofthis before [6]--I was the occasion of much evil, not thinking Iwas doing so much harm.16. In those early days, when I was ill, and before I knew how tobe of use to myself, I had a very strong desire to further theprogress of others: [7] a most common temptation of beginners.With me, however, it had good results.  Loving my father so much,I longed to see him in the possession of that good which I seemedto derive myself from prayer.  I thought that in this life therecould not be a greater good than prayer; and by roundabout ways,as well as I could, I contrived make him enter upon it; I gavehim books for that end.  As he was so good--I said sobefore [8]--this exercise took such a hold upon him, that in fiveor six years, I think it was, he made so great a progress that Iused to praise our Lord for it.  It was a very great consolationto me. He had most grievous trials of diverse kinds; and he borethem all with the greatest resignation.  He came often to see me;for it was a comfort to him to speak of the things of God.17. And now that I had become so dissipated, and had ceased topray, and yet saw that he still thought I was what I used to be,I could not endure it, and so undeceived him.  I had been a yearand more without praying, thinking it an act of greater humilityto abstain.  This--I shall speak of it again [9]--was thegreatest temptation I ever had, because it very nearly wrought myutter ruin; [10] for, when I used to pray, if I offended God oneday, on the following days I would recollect myself, and withdrawfarther from the occasions of sin.18. When that blessed man, having that good opinion of me, cameto visit me, it pained me to see him so deceived as to think thatI used to pray to God as before.  So I told him that I did notpray; but I did not tell him why.  I put my infirmities forwardas an excuse; for though I had recovered from that which was sotroublesome, I have always been weak, even very much so; andthough my infirmities are somewhat less troublesome now than theywere, they still afflict me in many ways; specially, I have beensuffering for twenty years from sickness every morning, [11] sothat I could not take any food till past mid-day, and evenoccasionally not till later; and now, since my Communions havebecome more frequent, it is at night, before I lie down to rest,that the sickness occurs, and with greater pain; for I have tobring it on with a feather, or other means.  If I do not bring iton, I suffer more; and thus I am never, I believe, free fromgreat pain, which is sometimes very acute, especially about theheart; though the fainting-fits are now but of rare occurrence.I am also, these eight years past, free from the paralysis, andfrom other infirmities of fever, which I had so often.  Theseafflictions I now regard so lightly, that I am even glad of them,believing that our Lord in some degree takes His pleasurein them.19. My father believed me when I gave him that for a reason, ashe never told a lie himself; neither should I have done so,considering the relation we were in.  I told him, in order to bethe more easily believed, that it was much for me to be able toattend in choir, though I saw clearly that this was no excusewhatever; neither, however, was it a sufficient reason for givingup a practice which does not require, of necessity, bodilystrength, but only love and a habit thereof; yet our Lord alwaysfurnishes an opportunity for it, if we but seek it.  I sayalways; for though there may be times, as in illness, and fromother causes, when we cannot be much alone, yet it never can bebut there must be opportunities when our strength is sufficientfor the purpose; and in sickness itself, and amidst otherhindrances, true prayer consists, when the soul loves, inoffering up its burden, and in thinking of Him for Whom itsuffers, and in the resignation of the will, and in a thousandways which then present themselves.  It is under thesecircumstances that love exerts itself for it is not necessarilyprayer when we are alone; and neither is it not prayer when weare not.20. With a little care, we may find great blessings on thoseoccasions when our Lord, by means of afflictions, deprives us oftime for prayer; and so I found it when I had a good conscience.But my father, having that opinion of me which he had, andbecause of the love he bore me, believed all I told him;moreover, he was sorry for me; and as he had now risen to greatheights of prayer himself, he never remained with me long; forwhen he had seen me, he went his way, saying that he was wastinghis time.  As I was wasting it in other vanities, I cared littleabout this.21. My father was not the only person whom I prevailed upon topractise prayer, though I was walking in vanity myself.  When Isaw persons fond of reciting their prayers, I showed them how tomake a meditation, and helped them and gave them books; for fromthe time I began myself to pray, as I said before, [12] I alwayshad a desire that others should serve God.  I thought, now that Idid not myself serve our Lord according to the light I had, thatthe knowledge His Majesty had given me ought not to be lost, andthat others should serve Him for me. [13]  I say this in order toexplain the great blindness I was in: going to ruin myself, andlabouring to save others.22. At this time, that illness befell my father of which hedied; [14] it lasted some days.  I went to nurse him, being moresick in spirit than he was in body, owing to my manyvanities--though not, so far as I know, to the extent of being inmortal sin--through the whole of that wretched time of which I amspeaking; for, if I knew myself to be in mortal sin, I would nothave continued in it on any account.  I suffered much myselfduring his illness.  I believe I rendered him some service inreturn for what he had suffered in mine.  Though I was very ill,I did violence to myself; and though in losing him I was to loseall the comfort and good of my life--he was all this to me--I wasso courageous, that I never betrayed my sorrows, concealing themtill he was dead, as if I felt none at all.  It seemed as if myvery soul were wrenched when I saw him at the point of death--mylove for him was so deep.23. It was a matter for which we ought to praise our Lord--thedeath that he died, and the desire he had to die; so also was theadvice he gave us after the last anointing, how he charged us torecommend him to God, and to pray for mercy for him, how he badeus serve God always, and consider how all things come to an end.He told us with tears how sorry he was that he had not served Himhimself; for he wished he was a friar--I mean, that he had beenone in the Strictest Order that is.  I have a most assuredconviction that our Lord, some fifteen days before, had revealedto him he was not to live; for up to that time, though very ill,he did not think so; but now, though he was somewhat better, andthe physicians said so, he gave no heed to them, but employedhimself in the ordering of his soul.24. His chief suffering consisted in a most acute pain of theshoulders, which never left him: it was so sharp at times, thatit put him into great torture.  I said to him, that as he had sogreat a devotion to our Lord carrying His cross on His shoulders,he should now think that His Majesty wished him to feel somewhatof that pain which He then suffered Himself. This so comfortedhim, that I do not think I heard him complain afterwards.25. He remained three days without consciousness; but on the dayhe died, our Lord restored him so completely, that we wereastonished: he preserved his understanding to the last; for inthe middle of the creed, which he repeated himself, he died.He lay there like an angel--such he seemed to me, if I may sayso, both in soul and disposition: he was very good.26. I know not why I have said this, unless it be for the purposeof showing how much the more I am to be blamed for my wickedness;for after seeing such a death, and knowing what his life hadbeen, I, in order to be in any wise like unto such a father,ought to have grown better.  His confessor, a most learnedDominican, [15] used to say that he had no doubt he went straightto heaven. [16]  He had heard his confession for some years, andspoke with praise of the purity of his conscience.27. This Dominican father, who was a very good man, fearing God,did me a very great service; for I confessed to him.  He tookupon himself the task of helping my soul in earnest, and ofmaking me see the perilous state I was in. [17]  He sent me toCommunion once a fortnight; [18] and I, by degrees beginning tospeak to him, told him about my prayer.  He charged me never toomit it: that, anyhow, it could not do me anything but good.I began to return to it--though I did not cut off the occasionsof sin--and never afterwards gave it up.  My life became mostwretched, because I learned in prayer more and more of my faults.On one side, God was calling me; on the other, I was followingthe world.  All the things of God gave me great pleasure; and Iwas a prisoner to the things of the world.  It seemed as if Iwished to reconcile two contradictions, so much at variance onewith another as are the life of the spirit and the joys andpleasures and amusements of sense. [19]28. I suffered much in prayer; for the spirit was slave, and notmaster; and so I was not able to shut myself up withinmyself--that was my whole method of prayer--without shutting upwith me a thousand vanities at the same time.  I spent many yearsin this way; and I am now astonished that any one could haveborne it without abandoning either the one or the other.  I knowwell that it was not in my power then to give up prayer, becauseHe held me in His hand Who sought me that He might show megreater mercies.29. O my God! if I might, I would speak of the occasions fromwhich God delivered me, and how I threw myself into them again;and of the risks I ran of losing utterly my good name, from whichHe delivered me.  I did things to show what I was; and our Lordhid the evil, and revealed some little virtue--if so be I hadany--and made it great in the eyes of all, so that they alwaysheld me in much honour.  For although my follies cameoccasionally into light, people would not believe it when theysaw other things, which they thought good.  The reason is, thatHe Who knoweth all things saw it was necessary it should be so,in order that I might have some credit given me by those to whomin after years I was to speak of His service.  His suprememunificence regarded not my great sins, but rather the desires Ifrequently had to please Him, and the pain I felt because I hadnot the strength to bring those desires to good effect.30. O Lord of my soul! how shall I be able to magnify the graceswhich Thou, in those years, didst bestow upon me?  Oh, how, atthe very time that I offended Thee most, Thou didst prepare me ina moment, by a most profound compunction, to taste of thesweetness of Thy consolations and mercies!  In truth, O my King,Thou didst administer to me the most delicate and painfulchastisement it was possible for me to bear; for Thou knewestwell what would have given me the most pain.  Thou didst chastisemy sins with great consolations.  I do not believe I am sayingfoolish things, though it may well be that I am beside myselfwhenever I call to mind my ingratitude and my wickedness.31. It was more painful for me, in the state I was in, to receivegraces, when I had fallen into grievous faults, than it wouldhave been to receive chastisement; for one of those faults, I amsure, used to bring me low, shame and distress me, more than manydiseases, together with many heavy trials, could have done.For, as to the latter, I saw that I deserved them; and it seemedto me that by them I was making some reparation for my sins,though it was but slight, for my sins are so many.  But when Isee myself receive graces anew, after being so ungrateful forthose already received, that is to me--and, I believe, to all whohave any knowledge or love of God--a fearful kind of torment.  Wemay see how true this is by considering what a virtuous mind mustbe. Hence my tears and vexation when I reflected on what I felt,seeing myself in a condition to fall at every moment, though myresolutions and desires then--I am speaking of thattime--were strong.32. It is a great evil for a soul to be alone in the midst ofsuch great dangers; it seems to me that if I had had any one withwhom I could have spoken of all this, it might have helped me notto fall.  I might, at least, have been ashamed before him--andyet I was not ashamed before God.33. For this reason, I would advise those who give themselves toprayer, particularly at first, to form friendships; and conversefamiliarly, with others who are doing the same thing.  It is amatter of the last importance, even if it lead only to helpingone another by prayer: how much more, seeing that it has led tomuch greater gain!  Now, if in their intercourse one withanother, and in the indulgence of human affections even not ofthe best kind, men seek friends with whom they may refreshthemselves, and for the purpose of having greater satisfaction inspeaking of their empty joys, I know no reason why it should notbe lawful for him who is beginning to love and serve God inearnest to confide to another his joys and sorrows; for they whoare given to prayer are thoroughly accustomed to both.34. For if that friendship with God which he desires be real, lethim not be afraid of vain-glory; and if the first movementsthereof assail him, he will escape from it with merit; and Ibelieve that he who will discuss the matter with this intentionwill profit both himself and those who hear him, and thus willderive more light for his own understanding, as well as for theinstruction of his friends.  He who in discussing his method ofprayer falls into vain-glory will do so also when he hears Massdevoutly, if he is seen of men, and in doing other good works,which must be done under pain of being no Christian; and yetthese things must not be omitted through fear of vain-glory.35. Moreover, it is a most important matter for those souls whoare not strong in virtue; for they have so many people, enemiesas well as friends, to urge them the wrong way, that I do not seehow this point is capable of exaggeration.  It seems to me thatSatan has employed this artifice--and it is of the greatestservice to him--namely, that men who really wish to love andplease God should hide the fact, while others, at his suggestion,make open show of their malicious dispositions; and this is socommon, that it seems a matter of boasting now, and the offencescommitted against God are thus published abroad.36. I do not know whether the things I am saying are foolish ornot.  If they be so, your reverence will strike them out.I entreat you to help my simplicity by adding a good deal tothis, because the things that relate to the service of God are sofeebly managed, that it is necessary for those who would serveHim to join shoulder to shoulder, if they are to advance at all;for it is considered safe to live amidst the vanities andpleasures of the world, and few there be who regard them withunfavourable eyes.  But if any one begins to give himself up tothe service of God, there are so many to find fault with him,that it becomes necessary for him to seek companions, in orderthat he may find protection among them till he grows strongenough not to feel what he may be made to suffer.  If he doesnot, he will find himself in great straits.37. This, I believe, must have been the reason why some of theSaints withdrew into the desert.  And it is a kind of humility inman not to trust to himself, but to believe that God will helphim in his relations with those with whom he converses; andcharity grows by being diffused; and there are a thousandblessings herein which I would not dare to speak of, if I had notknown by experience the great importance of it.  It is very truethat I am the most wicked and the basest of all who are born ofwomen; but I believe that he who, humbling himself, thoughstrong, yet trusteth not in himself, and believeth another who inthis matter has had experience, will lose nothing.  Of myself Imay say that, if our Lord had not revealed to me this truth, andgiven me the opportunity of speaking very frequently to personsgiven to prayer, I should have gone on falling and rising till Itumbled into hell.  I had many friends to help me to fall; but asto rising again, I was so much left to myself, that I wonder nowI was not always on the ground.  I praise God for His mercy; forit was He only Who stretched out His hand to me.  May He beblessed for ever!  Amen.1. See Way of Perfection, ch. xl.; but ch. xxvii. of theformer editions.2.

ISFJ	 VIII.The Saint Ceases Not to Pray.  Prayer the Way to Recover WhatIs Lost.  All Exhorted to Pray.  The Great Advantage of Prayer,Even to Those Who May Have Ceased from It.1. It is not without reason that I have dwelt so long on thisportion of my life.  I see clearly that it will give no onepleasure to see anything so base; and certainly I wish those whomay read this to have me in abhorrence, as a soul so obstinateand so ungrateful to Him Who did so much for me.  I could wish,too, I had permission to say how often at this time I failed inmy duty to God, because I was not leaning on the strong pillar ofprayer.  I passed nearly twenty years on this stormy sea, fallingand rising, but rising to no good purpose, seeing that I went andfell again.  My life was one of perfection; but it was so mean,that I scarcely made any account whatever of venial sins; andthough of mortal sins I was afraid, I was not so afraid of themas I ought to have been, because I did not avoid the perilousoccasions of them.  I may say that it was the most painful lifethat can be imagined, because I had no sweetness in God, and nopleasure in the world.2. When I was in the midst of the pleasures of the world, theremembrance of what I owed to God made me sad; and when I waspraying to God, my worldly affections disturbed me.  This is sopainful a struggle, that I know not how I could have borne it fora month, let alone for so many years.  Nevertheless, I can tracedistinctly the great mercy of our Lord to me, while thus immersedin the world, in that I had still the courage to pray.  I saycourage, because I know of nothing in the whole world whichrequires greater courage than plotting treason against the King,knowing that He knows it, and yet never withdrawing from Hispresence; for, granting that we are always in the presence ofGod, yet it seems to me that those who pray arc in His presencein a very different sense; for they, as it were, see that He islooking upon them; while others may be for days together withouteven once recollecting that God sees them.3. It is true, indeed, that during these years there were manymonths, and, I believe, occasionally a whole year, in which I sokept guard over myself that I did not offend our Lord, gavemyself much to prayer, and took some pains, and thatsuccessfully, not to offend Him.  I speak of this now, becauseall I am saying is strictly true; but I remember very little ofthose good days, and so they must have been few, while my evildays were many.  Still, the days that passed over without myspending a great part of them in prayer were few, unless I wasvery ill, or very much occupied.4. When I was ill, I was well with God.  I contrived that thoseabout me should be so, too, and I made supplications to our Lordfor this grace, and spoke frequently of Him.  Thus, with theexception of that year of which I have been speaking, duringeight-and-twenty years of prayer, I spent more than eighteen inthat strife and contention which arose out of my attempts toreconcile God and the world.  As to the other years, of which Ihave now to speak, in them the grounds of the warfare, though itwas not slight, were changed; but inasmuch as I was--at least, Ithink so--serving God, and aware of the vanity of the world, allhas been pleasant, as I shall show hereafter. [1]5. The reason, then, of my telling this at so great a length isthat, as I have just said, [2] the mercy of God and myingratitude, on the one hand, may become known; and, on theother, that men may understand how great is the good which Godworks in a soul when He gives it a disposition to pray inearnest, though it may not be so well prepared as it ought to be.If that soul perseveres in spite of sins, temptations, andrelapses, brought about in a thousand ways by Satan, our Lordwill bring it at last--I am certain of it--to the harbour ofsalvation, as He has brought me myself; for so it seems to menow.  May His Majesty grant I may never go back and be lost!He who gives himself to prayer is in possession of a greatblessing, of which many saintly and good men have written--I amspeaking of mental prayer--glory be to God for it; and, if theyhad not done so, I am not proud enough, though I have but littlehumility, to presume to discuss it.6. I may speak of that which I know by experience; and so I say,let him never cease from prayer who has once begun it, be hislife ever so wicked; for prayer is the way to amend it, andwithout prayer such amendment will be much more difficult.Let him not be tempted by Satan, as I was, to give it up, on thepretence of humility; [3] let him rather believe that His wordsare true Who says that, if we truly repent, and resolve never tooffend Him, He will take us into His favour again, [4] give usthe graces He gave us before, and occasionally even greater, ifour repentance deserve it.  And as to him who has not begun topray, I implore him by the love of our Lord not to deprivehimself of so great a good.7. Herein there is nothing to be afraid of, but everything tohope for.  Granting that such a one does not advance, nor make aneffort to become perfect, so as to merit the joys andconsolations which the perfect receive from God, yet he will bylittle and little attain to a knowledge of the road which leadsto heaven.  And if he perseveres, I hope in the mercy of God forhim, seeing that no one ever took Him for his friend that was notamply rewarded; for mental prayer is nothing else, in my opinion,but being on terms of friendship with God, frequently conversingin secret with Him Who, we know, loves us.  Now, true love andlasting friendship require certain dispositions: those of ourLord, we know, are absolutely perfect; ours, vicious, sensual,and thankless; and you cannot therefore, bring yourselves to loveHim as He loves you, because you have not the disposition to doso; and if you do not love Him, yet, seeing how much it concernsyou to have His friendship, and how great is His love for you,rise above that pain you feel at being much with Him Who is sodifferent from you.8. O infinite goodness of my God!  I seem to see Thee and myselfin this relation to one another.  O Joy of the angels! when Iconsider it, I wish I could wholly die of love!  How true it isthat Thou endurest those who will not endure Thee!  Oh, how gooda friend art Thou, O my Lord! how Thou comfortest and endurest,and also waitest for them to make themselves like unto Thee, andyet, in the meanwhile, art Thyself so patient of the state theyare in!  Thou takest into account the occasions during which theyseek Thee, and for a moment of penitence forgettest theiroffences against Thyself.9. I have seen this distinctly in my own case, and I cannot tellwhy the whole world does not labour to draw near to Thee in thisparticular friendship.  The wicked, who do not resemble Thee,ought to do so, in order that Thou mayest make them good, and forthat purpose should permit Thee to remain with them at least fortwo hours daily, even though they may not remain with Thee but,as I used to do, with a thousand distractions, and with worldlythoughts.  In return for this violence which they offer tothemselves for the purpose of remaining in a company so good asThine--for at first they can do no more, and even afterwards attimes--Thou, O Lord, defendest them against the assaults of evilspirits, whose power Thou restrainest, and even lessenest daily,giving to them the victory over these their enemies.  So it is, OLife of all lives, Thou slayest none that put their trust inThee, and seek Thy friendship; yea, rather, Thou sustainest theirbodily life in greater vigour, and makest their soul to live.10. I do not understand what there can be to make them afraid whoare afraid to begin mental prayer, nor do I know what it is theydread.  The devil does well to bring this fear upon us, that hemay really hurt us by putting me in fear, he can make me ceasefrom thinking of my offences against God, of the great debt I oweHim, of the existence of heaven and hell, and of the greatsorrows and trials He underwent for me.  That was all my prayer,and had been, when I was in this dangerous state, and it was onthose subjects I dwelt whenever I could; and very often, for someyears, I was more occupied with the wish to see the end of thetime I had appointed for myself to spend in prayer, and inwatching the hour-glass, than with other thoughts that were good.If a sharp penance had been laid upon me, I know of none that Iwould not very often have willingly undertaken, rather thanprepare myself for prayer by self-recollection.  And certainlythe violence with which Satan assailed me was so irresistible, ormy evil habits were so strong, that I did not betake myself toprayer; and the sadness I felt on entering the oratory was sogreat, that it required all the courage I had to force myself in.They say of me that my courage is not slight, and it is knownthat God has given me a courage beyond that of a woman; but Ihave made a bad use of it.  In the end, our Lord came to my help;and then, when I had done this violence to myself, I foundgreater peace and joy than I sometimes had when I had a desireto pray.11. If, then, our Lord bore so long with me, who was sowicked--and it is plain that it was by prayer all my evil wascorrected--why should any one, how wicked soever he may be, haveany fear? Let him be ever so wicked, he will not remain in hiswickedness so many years as I did, after receiving so many gracesfrom our Lord.  Is there any one who can despair, when He bore solong with me, only because I desired and contrived to find someplace and some opportunities for Him to be alone with me--andthat very often against my will? for I did violence to myself, orrather our Lord Himself did violence to me.12. If, then, to those who do not serve God, but rather offendHim, prayer be all this, and so necessary, and if no one canreally find out any harm it can do him, and if the omission of itbe not a still greater harm, why, then, should they abstain fromit who serve and desire to serve God?  Certainly I cannotcomprehend it, unless it be that men have a mind to go throughthe troubles of this life in greater misery, and to shut the doorin the face of God, so that He shall give them no comfort in it.I am most truly sorry for them, because they serve God at theirown cost; for of those who pray, God Himself defrays the charges,seeing that for a little trouble He gives sweetness, in orderthat, by the help it supplies, they may bear their trials.13. But because I have much to say hereafter of this sweetness,which our Lord gives to those who persevere in prayer, [5] I donot speak of it here; only this will I say: prayer is the door tothose great graces which our Lord bestowed upon me.  If this doorbe shut, I do not see how He can bestow them; for even if Heentered into a soul to take His delight therein, and to make thatsoul also delight in Him, there is no way by which He can do so;for His will is, that such a soul should be lonely and pure, witha great desire to receive His graces.  If we put many hindrancesin the way, and take no pains whatever to remove them, how can Hecome to us, and how can we have any desire that He should show usHis great mercies?14. I will speak now--for it is very important to understandit--of the assaults which Satan directs against a soul for thepurpose of taking it, and of the contrivances and compassionwherewith our Lord labours to convert it to Himself, in orderthat men may behold His mercy, and the great good it was for methat I did not give up prayer and spiritual reading, and thatthey may be on their guard against the dangers against which Iwas not on my guard myself.  And, above all, I implore them forthe love of our Lord, and for the great love with which He goethabout seeking our conversion to Himself, to beware of theoccasions of sin; for once placed therein, we have no ground torest on--so many enemies then assail us, and our own weakness issuch, that we cannot defend ourselves.15. Oh, that I knew how to describe the captivity of my soul inthose days!  I understood perfectly that I was in captivity, butI could not understand the nature of it; neither could I entirelybelieve that those things which my confessors did not make somuch of were so wrong as I in my soul felt them to be. One ofthem--I had gone to him with a scruple--told me that, even if Iwere raised to high contemplation, those occasions andconversations were not unfitting for me.  This was towards theend, when, by the grace of God, I was withdrawing more and morefrom those great dangers, but not wholly from the occasionsof them.16. When they saw my good desires, and how I occupied myself inprayer, I seemed to them to have done much; but my soul knew thatthis was not doing what I was bound to do for Him to Whom I owedso much.  I am sorry for my poor soul even now, because of itsgreat sufferings, and the little help it had from any one exceptGod, and for the wide door that man opened for it, that it mightgo forth to its pastimes and pleasures, when they said that thesethings were lawful.17. Then there was the torture of sermons, and that not a slightone; for I was very fond of them.  If I heard any one preach welland with unction, I felt, without my seeking it, a particularaffection for him, neither do I know whence it came.  Thus, nosermon ever seemed to me so bad, but that I listened to it withpleasure; though, according to others who heard it, the preachingwas not good.  If it was a good sermon, it was to me a mostspecial refreshment.  To speak of God, or to hear Him spoken of,never wearied me.  I am speaking of the time after I gave myselfto prayer.  At one time I had great comfort in sermons, atanother they distressed me, because they made me feel that I wasvery far from being what I ought to have been.18. I used to pray to our Lord for help; but, as it now seems tome, I must have committed the fault of not putting my whole trustin His Majesty, and of not thoroughly distrusting myself.I sought for help, took great pains; but it must be that I didnot understand how all is of little profit if we do not root outall confidence in ourselves, and place it wholly in God. I wishedto live, but I saw clearly that I was not living, but ratherwrestling with the shadow of death; there was no one to give melife, and I was not able to take it.  He Who could have given itme had good reasons for not coming to my aid, seeing that He hadbrought me back to Himself so many times, and I as often hadleft Him.1. Ch. ix. § 10.2. § 1, above.3.

ISFJ	 IX.The Means Whereby Our Lord Quickened Her Soul, Gave Her Light inHer Darkness, and Made Her Strong in Goodness.1. My soul was now grown weary; and the miserable habits it hadcontracted would not suffer it to rest, though it was desirous ofdoing so.  It came to pass one day, when I went into the oratory,that I saw a picture which they had put by there, and which hadbeen procured for a certain feast observed in the house.  It wasa representation of Christ most grievously wounded; and sodevotional, that the very sight of it, when I saw it, movedme--so well did it show forth that which He suffered for us.So keenly did I feel the evil return I had made for those wounds,that I thought my heart was breaking.  I threw myself on theground beside it, my tears flowing plenteously, and implored Himto strengthen me once for all, so that I might never offend Himany more.2. I had a very great devotion to the glorious Magdalene, andvery frequently used to think of her conversion--especially whenI went to Communion.  As I knew for certain that our Lord wasthen within me, I used to place myself at His feet, thinking thatmy tears would not be despised.  I did not know what I wassaying; only He did great things for me, in that He was pleased Ishould shed those tears, seeing that I so soon forgot thatimpression.  I used to recommend myself to that glorious Saint,that she might obtain my pardon.3. But this last time, before that picture of which I amspeaking, I seem to have made greater progress; for I was nowvery distrustful of myself, placing all my confidence in God.It seems to me that I said to Him then that I would not rise uptill He granted my petition.  I do certainly believe that thiswas of great service to me, because I have grown betterever since. [1]4. This was my method of prayer: as I could not make reflectionswith my understanding, I contrived to picture Christ as withinme; [2] and I used to find myself the better for thinking ofthose mysteries of His life during which He was most lonely.It seemed to me that the being alone and afflicted, like a personin trouble, must needs permit me to come near unto Him.5. I did many simple things of this kind; and in particular Iused to find myself most at home in the prayer in the Garden,whither I went in His company.  I thought of the bloody sweat,and of the affliction He endured there; I wished, if it had beenpossible, to wipe away that painful sweat from His face; but Iremember that I never dared to form such a resolution--my sinsstood before me so grievously.  I used to remain with Him thereas long as my thoughts allowed me, and I had many thoughts totorment me.  For many years, nearly every night before I fellasleep, when I recommended myself to God, that I might sleep inpeace, I used always to think a little of this mystery of theprayer in the Garden--yea, even before I was a nun, because I hadbeen told that many indulgences were to be gained thereby.For my part, I believe that my soul gained very much in this way,because I began to practise prayer without knowing what it was;and now that it had become my constant habit, I was saved fromomitting it, as I was from omitting to bless myself with the signof the cross before I slept.6. And now to go back to what I was saying of the torture whichmy thoughts inflicted upon me.  This method of praying, in whichthe understanding makes no reflections, hath this property: thesoul must gain much, or lose.  I mean, that those who advancewithout meditation, make great progress, because it is done bylove.  But to attain to this involves great labour, except tothose persons whom it is our Lord's good pleasure to lead quicklyto the prayer of quiet.  I know of some.  For those who walk inthis way, a book is profitable, that by the help thereof they maythe more quickly recollect themselves.  It was a help to me alsoto look on fields, water, and flowers. [3] In them I saw tracesof the Creator--I mean, that the sight of these things was as abook unto me; it roused me, made me recollected, and reminded meof my ingratitude and of my sins.  My understanding was so dull,that I could never represent in the imagination either heavenlyor high things in any form whatever until our Lord placed thembefore me in another way. [4]7. I was so little able to put things before me by the help of myunderstanding, that, unless I saw a thing with my eyes, myimagination was of no use whatever.  I could not do as others do,who can put matters before themselves so as to become therebyrecollected.  I was able to think of Christ only as man.  But soit was; and I never could form any image of Him to myself, thoughI read much of His beauty, and looked at pictures of Him.  I waslike one who is blind, or in the dark, who, though speaking to aperson present, and feeling his presence, because he knows forcertain that he is present--I mean, that he understands him to bepresent, and believes it--yet does not see him.  It was thus withme when I used to think of our Lord.  This is why I was so fondof images.  Wretched are they who, through their own fault, havelost this blessing; it is clear enough that they do not love ourLord--for if they loved Him, they would rejoice at the sight ofHis picture, just as men find pleasure when they see the portraitof one they love.8. At this time, the Confessions of St. Augustine were given me.Our Lord seems to have so ordained it, for I did not seek themmyself, neither had I ever seen them before.  I had a very greatdevotion to St. Augustine, because the monastery in which I livedwhen I was yet in the world was of his Order; [5] and alsobecause he had been a sinner--for I used to find great comfort inthose Saints whom, after they had sinned, our Lord converted toHimself.  I thought they would help me, and that, as our Lord hadforgiven them, so also He would forgive me.  One thing, however,there was that troubled me--I have spoken of it before [6]--ourLord had called them but once, and they never relapsed; while myrelapses were now so many.  This it was that vexed me.But calling to mind the love that He bore me, I took courageagain. Of His mercy I never doubted once, but I did very oftenof myself.9. O my God, I amazed at the hardness of my heart amidst so manysuccours from Thee.  I am filled with dread when I see how littleI could do with myself, and how I was clogged, so that I couldnot resolve to give myself entirely to God.  When I began to readthe Confessions, I thought I saw myself there described, andbegan to recommend myself greatly to this glorious Saint. When Icame to his conversion, and read how he heard that voice in thegarden, it seemed to me nothing less than that our Lord haduttered it for me: I felt so in my heart.  I remained for sometime lost in tears, in great inward affliction and distress. O myGod, what a soul has to suffer because it has lost the liberty ithad of being mistress over itself! and what torments it has toendure!  I wonder now how I could live in torments so great: Godbe praised Who gave me life, so that I might escape from so fatala death!  I believe that my soul obtained great strength from HisDivine Majesty, and that He must have heard my cry, and hadcompassion upon so many tears.10. A desire to spend more time with Him began to grow within me,and also to withdraw from the occasions of sin: for as soon as Ihad done so, I turned lovingly to His Majesty at once.I understood clearly, as I thought, that I loved Him; but I didnot understand, as I ought to have understood it, wherein thetrue love of God consists.  I do not think I had yet perfectlydisposed myself to seek His service when His Majesty turnedtowards me with His consolations.  What others strive after withgreat labour, our Lord seems to have looked out for a way to makeme willing to accept--that is, in these later years to give mejoy and comfort.  But as for asking our Lord to give me eitherthese things or sweetness in devotion, I never dared to do it;the only thing I prayed Him to give me was the grace never tooffend Him, together with the forgiveness of my great sins.When I saw that my sins were so great, I never ventureddeliberately to ask for consolation or for sweetness.  He hadcompassion enough upon me, I think--and, in truth, He dealt withme according to His great mercy--when He allowed me to standbefore Him, and when He drew me into His presence; for I sawthat, if He had not drawn me, I should not have come at all.11. Once only in my life do I remember asking for consolation,being at the time in great aridities.  When I considered what Ihad done, I was so confounded, that the very distress I sufferedfrom seeing how little humility I had, brought me that which Ihad been so bold as to ask for.  I knew well that it was lawfulto pray for it; but it seemed to me that it is lawful only forthose who are in good dispositions, who have sought with alltheir might to attain to true devotion--that is, not to offendGod, and to be disposed and resolved for all goodness.  I lookedupon those tears of mine as womanish and weak, seeing that I didnot obtain my desires by them; nevertheless, I believe that theydid me some service; for, specially after those two occasions ofgreat compunction and sorrow of heart, [7] accompanied by tears,of which I am speaking, I began in an especial way to give myselfmore to prayer, and to occupy myself less with those things whichdid me harm--though I did not give them up altogether.  But GodHimself, as I have just said, came to my aid, and helped me toturn away from them.  As His Majesty was only waiting for somepreparation on my part, the spiritual graces grew in me as Ishall now explain.  It is not the custom of our Lord to givethese graces to any but to those who keep their consciences ingreater pureness. [8]1. In the year 1555 (Bouix).2. See ch. iv. § 10; ch. x. § 1.3.

ISFJ	 X.The Graces She Received in Prayer.  What We Can Do Ourselves.The Great Importance of Understanding What Our Lord Is Doingfor Us.  She Desires Her Confessors to Keep Her Writings Secret,Because of the Special Graces of Our Lord to Her, Which They HadCommanded Her to Describe.1. I used to have at times, as I have said, [1] though it used topass quickly away--certain commencements of that which I am goingnow to describe.  When I formed those pictures within myself ofthrowing myself at the feet of Christ, as I said before, [2] andsometimes even when I was reading, a feeling of the presence ofGod would come over me unexpectedly, so that I could in no wisedoubt either that He was within me, or that I was wholly absorbedin Him.  It was not by way of vision; I believe it was what iscalled mystical theology.   The soul is suspended in such a waythat it seems to be utterly beside itself.  The will loves; thememory, so it seems to me, is as it were lost; and theunderstanding, so I think, makes no reflections--yet is not lost:as I have just said, it is not at work, but it stands as ifamazed at the greatness of the things it understands; for Godwills it to understand that it understands nothing whatever ofthat which His Majesty places before it.2. Before this, I had a certain tenderness of soul which was veryabiding, partially attainable, I believe, in some measure, by ourown efforts: a consolation which is not wholly in the senses, noryet altogether in the spirit, but is all of it the gift of God.However, I think we can contribute much towards the attaining ofit by considering our vileness and our ingratitude towardsGod--the great things He has done for us--His Passion, with itsgrievous pains--and His life, so full of sorrows; also, byrejoicing in the contemplation of His works, of His greatness,and of the love that He bears us.  Many other considerationsthere are which he who really desires to make progress will oftenstumble on, though he may not be very much on the watch for them.If with this there be a little love, the soul is comforted, theheart is softened, and tears flow.  Sometimes it seems that we doviolence to ourselves and weep; at other times, our Lord seems todo so, so that we have no power to resist Him.  His Majesty seemsto reward this slight carefulness of ours with so grand a gift asis this consolation which He ministers to the soul of seeingitself weeping for so great a Lord.  I am not surprised; for thesoul has reason enough, and more than enough, for its joy.  Hereit comforts itself--here it rejoices.3. The comparison which now presents itself seems to me to begood.  These joys in prayer are like what those of heaven mustbe.  As the vision of the saints, which is measured by theirmerits there, reaches no further than our Lord wills, and as theblessed see how little merit they had, every one of them issatisfied with the place assigned him: there being the verygreatest difference between one joy and another in heaven, andmuch greater than between one spiritual joy and another onearth--which is, however, very great.  And in truth, in thebeginning, a soul in which God works this grace thinks that nowit has scarcely anything more to desire, and counts itselfabundantly rewarded for all the service it has rendered Him.And there is reason for this: for one of those tears--which, as Ihave just said, are almost in our own power, though without Godnothing can be done--cannot, in my opinion, be purchased with allthe labours of the world, because of the great gain it brings us.And what greater gain can we have than some testimony of ourhaving pleased God?  Let him, then, who shall have attained tothis, give praise unto God--acknowledge himself to be one of Hisgreatest debtors; because it seems to be His will to take himinto His house, having chosen him for His kingdom, if he does notturn back.4. Let him not regard certain kinds of humility which exist, andof which I mean to speak. [3]  Some think it humility not tobelieve that God is bestowing His gifts upon them.  Let usclearly understand this, and that it is perfectly clear Godbestows His gifts without any merit whatever on our part; and letus be grateful to His Majesty for them; for if we do notrecognize the gifts received at His hands, we shall never bemoved to love Him.  It is a most certain truth, that the richerwe see ourselves to be, confessing at the same time our poverty,the greater will be our progress, and the more real our humility.5. An opposite course tends to take away all courage; for weshall think ourselves incapable of great blessings, if we beginto frighten ourselves with the dread of vain-glory when our Lordbegins to show His mercy upon us. [4]  Let us believe that He Whogives these gifts will also, when the devil begins to tempt usherein, give us the grace to detect him, and the strength toresist him--that is, He will do so if we walk in simplicitybefore God, aiming at pleasing Him only, and not men.  It is amost evident truth, that our love for a person is greater, themore distinctly we remember the good he has done us.6. If, then, it is lawful, and so meritorious, always to rememberthat we have our being from God, that He has created us out ofnothing, that He preserves us, and also to remember all thebenefits of His death and Passion, which He suffered long beforeHe made us for every one of us now alive--why should it not belawful for me to discern, confess, and consider often that I wasonce accustomed to speak of vanities, and that now our Lord hasgiven me the grace to speak only of Himself?7. Here, then, is a precious pearl, which, when we remember thatit is given us, and that we have it in possession, powerfullyinvites us to love.  All this is the fruit of prayer founded onhumility.  What, then, will it be when we shall find ourselves inpossession of other pearls of greater price, such as contempt ofthe world and of self, which some servants of God have alreadyreceived?  It is clear that such souls must consider themselvesgreater debtors--under greater obligations to serve Him: we mustacknowledge that we have nothing of ourselves, and confess themunificence of our Lord, Who, on a soul so wretched and poor, andso utterly undeserving, as mine is,--for whom the first of thesepearls was enough, and more than enough,--would bestow greaterriches than I could desire.8. We must renew our strength to serve Him, and strive not to beungrateful, because it is on this condition that our Lorddispenses His treasures; for if we do not make a good use ofthem, and of the high estate to which He raises us, He willreturn and take them from us, and we shall be poorer than ever.His Majesty will give the pearls to him who shall bring themforth and employ them usefully for himself and others.  For howshall he be useful, and how shall he spend liberally, who doesnot know that he is rich?  It is not possible, I think, ournature being what it is, that he can have the courage necessaryfor great things who does not know that God is on his side; forso miserable are we, so inclined to the things of this world,that he can hardly have any real abhorrence of, with greatdetachment from, all earthly things who does not see that heholds some pledges for those things that are above.  It is bythese gifts that our Lord gives us that strength which we throughour sins have lost.9. A man will hardly wish to be held in contempt and abhorrence,nor will he seek after the other great virtues to which theperfect attain, if he has not some pledges of the love which Godbears him, together with a living faith.  Our nature is so dead,that we go after that which we see immediately before us; and itis these graces, therefore, that quicken and strengthen ourfaith.  It may well be that I, who am so wicked, measure othersby myself, and that others require nothing more than the veritiesof the faith, in order to render their works most perfect; whileI, wretched that I am! have need of everything.10. Others will explain this.  I speak from my own experience, asI have been commanded; and if what I say be not correct, lethim [5] to whom I send it destroy it; for he knows better than Ido what is wrong in it.  I entreat him, for the love of our Lord,to publish abroad what I have thus far said of my wretched life,and of my sins.  I give him leave to do so; and to all myconfessors, also,--of whom he is one--to whom this is to be sent,if it be their pleasure, even during my life, so that I may nolonger deceive people who think there must be some good inme.  [6] Certainly, I speak in all sincerity, so far as Iunderstand myself.  Such publication will give me great comfort.11. But as to that which I am now going to say, I give no suchleave; nor, if it be shown to any one, do I consent to its beingsaid who the person is whose experience it describes, nor whowrote it.  This is why I mention neither my own name, nor that ofany other person whatever.  I have written it in the best way Icould, in order not to be known; and this I beg of them for thelove of God.  Persons so learned and grave as they are [7] haveauthority enough to approve of whatever right things I may say,should our Lord give me the grace to do so; and if I should sayanything of the kind, it will be His, and not mine--because I amneither learned nor of good life, and I have no person oflearning or any other to teach me; for they only who ordered meto write know that I am writing, and at this moment they are nothere.  I have, as it were, to steal the time, and that withdifficulty, because my writing hinders me from spinning.  I amliving in a house that is poor, and have many things to do. [8]If, indeed, our Lord had given me greater abilities and a bettermemory, I might then profit by what I have seen and read; but myabilities are very slight.  If, then, I should say anything thatis right, our Lord will have it said for some good purpose; thatwhich may be wrong will be mine, and your reverence will strikeit out.12. In neither case will it be of any use to publish my name:during my life, it is clear that no good I may have done ought tobe told; after death, there is no reason against it, except thatit will lose all authority and credit, because related of aperson so vile and so wicked as I am.  And because I think yourreverence and the others who may see this writing will do thisthat I ask of you, for the love of our Lord, I write withfreedom.  If it were not so, I should have great scruples, exceptin declaring my sins: and in that matter I should have none atall.  For the rest, it is enough that I am a woman to make mysails droop: how much more, then, when I am a woman, and awicked one?13. So, then, everything here beyond the simple story of my lifeyour reverence must take upon yourself--since you have so pressedme to give some account of the graces which our Lord bestowedupon me in prayer--if it be consistent with the truths of ourholy Catholic faith; if it be not, your reverence must burn it atonce--for I give my consent.  I will recount my experience, inorder that, if it be consistent with those truths, your reverencemay make some use of it; if not, you will deliver my soul fromdelusion, so that Satan may gain nothing there where I seemed tobe gaining myself.  Our Lord knows well that I, as I shall showhereafter, [9] have always laboured to find out those who couldgive me light.14. How clear soever I may wish to make my account of that whichrelates to prayer, it will be obscure enough for those who arewithout experience.  I shall speak of certain hindrances, which,as I understand it, keep men from advancing on this road--and ofother things which are dangerous, as our Lord has taught me byexperience.  I have also discussed the matter with men of greatlearning, with persons who for many years had lived spirituallives, who admit that, in the twenty-seven years only duringwhich I have given myself to prayer--though I walked so ill, andstumbled so often on the road--His Majesty granted me thatexperience which others attain to in seven-and-thirty, orseven-and-forty, years; and they, too, being persons who everadvanced in the way of penance and of virtue.15. Blessed be God for all, and may His infinite Majesty make useof me!  Our Lord knoweth well that I have no other end in thisthan that He may be praised and magnified a little, when menshall see that on a dunghill so foul and rank He has made agarden of flowers so sweet.  May it please His Majesty that I maynot by my own fault root them out, and become again what I wasbefore.  And I entreat your reverence, for the love of our Lord,to beg this of Him for me, seeing that you have a clearerknowledge of what I am than you have allowed me to give ofmyself here.1.

ISFJ	 XI.Why Men Do Not Attain Quickly to the Perfect Love of God.Of Four Degrees of Prayer.  Of the First Degree.  The DoctrineProfitable for Beginners, and for Those Who Have NoSensible Sweetness.1. I speak now of those who begin to be the servants of love;that seems to me to be nothing else but to resolve to follow Himin the way of prayer, who has loved us so much.  It is a dignityso great, that I have a strange joy in thinking of it; forservile fear vanishes at once, if we are, as we ought to be, inthe first degree.  O Lord of my soul, and my good, how is itthat, when a soul is determined to love Thee--doing all it can,by forsaking all things, in order that it may the better occupyitself with the love of God--it is not Thy will it should havethe joy of ascending at once to the possession of perfect love?I have spoken amiss; I ought to have said, and my complaintshould have been, why is it we do not? for the fault is whollyour own that we do not rejoice at once in a dignity so great,seeing that the attaining to the perfect possession of this truelove brings all blessings with it.2. We think so much of ourselves, and are so dilatory in givingourselves wholly to God, that, as His Majesty will not let ushave the fruition of that which is so precious but at a greatcost, so neither do we perfectly prepare ourselves for it.  I seeplainly that there is nothing by which so great a good can beprocured in this world.  If, however, we did what we could, notclinging to anything upon earth, but having all our thoughts andconversation in Heaven, I believe that this blessing wouldquickly be given us, provided we perfectly prepared ourselves forit at once, as some of the saints have done.  We think we aregiving all to God; but, in fact, we are offering only the revenueor the produce, while we retain the fee-simple of the land in ourown possession.3. We resolve to become poor, and it is a resolution of greatmerit; but we very often take great care not to be in want, notsimply of what is necessary, but of what is superfluous: yea, andto make for ourselves friends who may supply us; and in this waywe take more pains, and perhaps expose ourselves to greaterdanger, in order that we may want nothing, than we did formerly,when we had our own possessions in our own power.4. We thought, also, that we gave up all desire of honour when webecame religious, or when we began the spiritual life, andfollowed after perfection; and yet, when we are touched on thepoint of honour, we do not then remember that we had given it upto God.  We would seize it again, and take it, as they say, outof His Hands, even after we had made Him, to all appearance, theLord of our own will.  So is it in every thing else.5. A pleasant way this of seeking the love of God! we retain ourown affections, and yet will have that love, as they say, byhandfuls.  We make no efforts to bring our desires to goodeffect, or to raise them resolutely above the earth; and yet,with all this, we must have many spiritual consolations.  This isnot well, and we are seeking things that are incompatible onewith the other.  So, because we do not give ourselves up whollyand at once, this treasure is not given wholly and at once to us.May it be the good pleasure of our Lord to give it us drop bydrop, though it may cost us all the trials in the world.6. He showeth great mercy unto him to whom He gives the grace andresolution to strive for this blessing with all his might; forGod withholds Himself from no one who perseveres.  He will bylittle and little strengthen that soul, so that it may come forthvictorious.  I say resolution, because of the multitude of thosethings which Satan puts before it at first, to keep it back frombeginning to travel on this road; for he knoweth what harm willbefall him thereby--he will lose not only that soul, but manyothers also.  If he who enters on this road does violence tohimself, with the help of God, so as to reach the summit ofperfection, such a one, I believe, will never go alone to Heaven;he will always take many with him: God gives to him, as to a goodcaptain, those who shall be of his company.7. Thus, then, the dangers and difficulties which Satan putsbefore them are so many, that they have need, not of a little,but of a very great, resolution, and great grace from God, tosave them from falling away.8. Speaking, then, of their beginnings who are determined tofollow after this good, and to succeed in their enterprise--whatI began to say [1] of mystical theology--I believe they call itby that name--I shall proceed with hereafter--I have to say thatthe labour is greatest at first; for it is they who toil, ourLord, indeed, giving them strength.  In the other degrees ofprayer, there is more of fruition; although they who are in thebeginning, the middle, and the end, have their crosses to carry:the crosses, however, are different.  They who would followChrist, if they do not wish to be lost, must walk in the way Hewalked Himself.  Blessed labours! even here, in this life, sosuperabundantly rewarded!9. I shall have to make use of a comparison; I should like toavoid it, because I am a woman, and write simply what I have beencommanded.  But this language of spirituality is so difficult ofutterance for those who are not learned, and such am I.  I havetherefore to seek for some means to make the matter plain.It may be that the comparison will very rarely be to thepurpose--your reverence will be amused when you see my stupidity.I think, now, I have either read or heard of this comparison; butas my memory is bad, I know not where, nor on what occasion;however, I am satisfied with it for my present purpose. [2]10. A beginner must look upon himself as making a garden, whereinour Lord may take His delight, but in a soil unfruitful, andabounding in weeds.  His Majesty roots up the weeds, and has toplant good herbs.  Let us, then, take for granted that this isalready done when a soul is determined to give itself to prayer,and has begun the practice of it.  We have, then, as goodgardeners, by the help of God, to see that the plants grow, towater them carefully, that they may not die, but produceblossoms, which shall send forth much fragrance, refreshing toour Lord, so that He may come often for His pleasure into thisgarden, and delight Himself in the midst of these virtues.11. Let us now see how this garden is to be watered, that we mayunderstand what we have to do: how much trouble it will cost us,whether the gain be greater than the trouble, or how long a timeit will take us.  It seems to me that the garden may be wateredin four ways: by water taken out of a well, which is verylaborious; or with water raised by means of an engine andbuckets, drawn by a windlass--I have drawn it this waysometimes--it is a less troublesome way than the first, and givesmore water; or by a stream or brook, whereby the garden iswatered in a much better way--for the soil is more thoroughlysaturated, and there is no necessity to water it so often, andthe labour of the gardener is much less; or by showers of rain,when our Lord Himself waters it, without labour on our part--andthis way is incomparably better than all the others of which Ihave spoken.12. Now, then, for the application of these four ways ofirrigation by which the garden is to be maintained; for withoutwater it must fail.  The comparison is to my purpose, and itseems to me that by the help of it I shall be able to explain, insome measure, the four degrees of prayer to which our Lord, ofHis goodness, has occasionally raised my soul.  May He graciouslygrant that I may so speak as to be of some service to one ofthose who has commanded me to write, whom our Lord has raised infour months to a greater height than I have reached in seventeenyears!  He prepared himself better than I did, and therefore ishis garden without labour on his part, irrigated by these fourwaters--though the last of them is only drop by drop; but it isgrowing in such a way, that soon, by the help of our Lord, hewill be swallowed up therein, and it will be a pleasure to me, ifhe finds my explanation absurd, that he should laugh at it.13. Of those who are beginners in prayer, we may say, that theyare those who draw the water up out of the well--a process which,as I have said, is very laborious; for they must be wearied inkeeping the senses recollected, and this is a great labour,because the senses have been hitherto accustomed to distractions.It is necessary for beginners to accustom themselves to disregardwhat they hear or see, and to put it away from them during thetime of prayer; they must be alone, and in retirement think overtheir past life.  Though all must do this many times, beginnersas well as those more advanced; all, however, must not do soequally, as I shall show hereafter. [3] Beginners at first suffermuch, because they are not convinced that they are penitent fortheir sins; and yet they are, because they are so sincerelyresolved on serving God.  They must strive to meditate on thelife of Christ, and the understanding is wearied thereby.Thus far we can advance of ourselves--that is, by the grace ofGod--for without that, as every one knows, we never can have onegood thought.14. This is beginning to draw water up out of the well.God grant there may be water in it!  That, however, does notdepend on us; we are drawing it, and doing what we can towardswatering the flowers.  So good is God, that when, for reasonsknown to His Majesty--perhaps for our greater good--it is Hiswill the well should be dry, He Himself preserves the flowerswithout water--we, like good gardeners, doing what lies in ourpower--and makes our virtues grow.  By water here I mean tears,and if there be none, then tenderness and an inward feelingof devotion.15. What, then, will he do here who sees that, for many days, heis conscious only of aridity, disgust, dislike, and so great anunwillingness to go to the well for water, that he would give itup altogether, if he did not remember that he has to please andserve the Lord of the garden; if he did not trust that hisservice was not in vain, and did not hope for some gain by alabour so great as that of lowering the bucket into the well sooften, and drawing it up without water in it?  It will happenthat he is often unable to move his arms for that purpose, or tohave one good thought: working with the understanding is drawingwater out of the well.16. What, then, once more, will the gardener do now?  He mustrejoice and take comfort, and consider it as the greatest favourto labour in the garden of so great an Emperor; and as he knowsthat he is pleasing Him in the matter--and his purpose must notbe to please himself, but Him--let him praise Him greatly for thetrust He has in him--for He sees that, without any recompense, heis taking so much care of that which has been confided to him;let him help Him to carry the Cross, and let him think how Hecarried it all His life long; let him not seek his kingdom here,nor ever intermit his prayer; and so let him resolve, if thisaridity should last even his whole life long, never to let Christfall down beneath the Cross. [4]17. The time will come when he shall be paid once for all.Let him have no fear that his labour is in vain: he serves a goodMaster, Whose eyes are upon him.  Let him make no account of evilthoughts, but remember that Satan suggested them to St. Jeromealso in the desert. [5]  These labours have their reward, I knowit; for I am one who underwent them for many years.  When I drewbut one drop of water out of this blessed well, I considered itwas a mercy of God.  I know these labours are very great, andrequire, I think, greater courage than many others in this world;but I have seen clearly that God does not leave them without agreat recompense, even in this life; for it is very certain thatin one hour, during which our Lord  gave me to taste Hissweetness, all the anxieties which I had to bear when perseveringin prayer seem to me ever afterwards perfectly rewarded.18. I believe that it is our Lord's good pleasure frequently inthe beginning, and at times in the end, to send these torments,and many other incidental temptations, to try those who love Him,and to ascertain if they will drink the chalice, [6] and help Himto carry the Cross, before He intrusts them with His greattreasures.  I believe it to be for our good that His Majestyshould lead us by this way, so that we may perfectly understandhow worthless we are; for the graces which He gives afterwardsare of a dignity so great, that He will have us by experienceknow our wretchedness before He grants them, that it may not bewith us as it was with Lucifer.19. What canst Thou do, O my Lord, that is not for the greatergood of that soul which Thou knowest to be already Thine, andwhich gives itself up to Thee to follow Thee whithersoever Thougoest, even to the death of the Cross; and which is determined tohelp Thee to carry that Cross, and not to leave Thee alone withit?  He who shall discern this resolution in himself has nothingto fear: no, no; spiritual people have nothing to fear.  There isno reason why he should be distressed who is already raised to sohigh a degree as this is of wishing to converse in solitude withGod, and to abandon the amusements of the world.  The greaterpart of the work is done; give praise to His Majesty for it, andtrust in His goodness who has never failed those who love Him.Close the eyes of your imagination, and do not ask why He givesdevotion to this person in so short a time, and none to me afterso many years.  Let us believe that all is for our greater good;let His Majesty guide us whithersoever He will: we are not ourown, but His.  He shows us mercy enough when it is His pleasurewe should be willing to dig in His garden, and to be so near theLord of it: He certainly is near to us.  If it be His will thatthese plants and flowers should grow--some of them when He giveswater we may draw from the well, others when He gives none--whatis that to me?  Do Thou, O Lord, accomplish Thy will; let menever offend Thee, nor let my virtues perish; if Thou hast givenme any, it is out of Thy mere goodness.  I wish to suffer,because Thou, O Lord, hast suffered; do Thou in every way fulfilThy will in me, and may it never be the pleasure of Thy Majestythat a gift of so high a price as that of Thy love, be given topeople who serve Thee only because of the sweetness theyfind thereby.20. It is much to be observed, and I say so because I know byexperience, that the soul which, begins to walk in the way ofmental prayer with resolution, and is determined not to caremuch, neither to rejoice nor to be greatly afflicted, whethersweetness and tenderness fail it, or our Lord grants them, hasalready travelled a great part of the road.  Let that soul, then,have no fear that it is going back, though it may frequentlystumble; for the building is begun on a firm foundation.  It iscertain that the love of God does not consist in tears, nor inthis sweetness and tenderness which we for the most part desire,and with which we console ourselves; but rather in serving Him injustice, fortitude, and humility.  That seems to me to be areceiving rather than a giving of anything on our part.21. As for poor women, such as I am, weak and infirm of purpose,it seems to me to be necessary that I should be led on throughconsolations, as God is doing now, so that I might be able toendure certain afflictions which it has pleased His Majesty Ishould have.  But when the servants of God, who are men ofweight, learning, and sense, make so much account, as I see theydo, whether God gives them sweetness in devotion or not, I amdisgusted when I listen to them.  I do not say that they oughtnot to accept it, and make much of it, when God givesit--because, when He gives it, His Majesty sees it to benecessary for them--but I do say that they ought not to growweary when they have it not.  They should then understand thatthey have no need of it, and be masters of themselves, when HisMajesty does not give it.  Let them be convinced of this, thereis a fault here; I have had experience of it, and know it to beso.  Let them believe it as an imperfection: they are notadvancing in liberty of spirit, but shrinking like cowards fromthe assault.22. It is not so much to beginners that I say this--though I doinsist upon it, because it is of great importance to them thatthey should begin with this liberty and resolution--as to others,of whom there are many, who make a beginning, but never come tothe end; and that is owing, I believe, in great measure, to theirnot having embraced the Cross from the first.  They aredistressed, thinking they are doing nothing; the understandingceases from its acts, and they cannot bear it.  Yet, perhaps, atthat very time, the will is feeding and gathering strength, andthey know it not.23. We must suppose that our Lord does not regard these things;for though they seem to us to be faults, yet they are not.His Majesty knoweth our misery and natural vileness better thanwe do ourselves.  He knoweth that these souls long to be alwaysthinking of Him and loving Him.  It is this resolution that Heseeks in us; the other anxieties which we inflict upon ourselvesserve to no other end but to disquiet the soul--which, if it beunable to derive any profit in one hour, will by them be disabledfor four.  This comes most frequently from bodilyindisposition--I have had very great experience in the matter,and I know it is true; for I have carefully observed it anddiscussed it afterwards with spiritual persons--for we are sowretched, that this poor prisoner of a soul shares in themiseries of the body. The changes of the seasons, and thealterations of the humours, very often compel it, without faultof its own, not to do what it would, but rather to suffer inevery way.  Meanwhile, the more we force the soul on theseoccasions, the greater the mischief, and the longer it lasts.Some discretion must be used, in order to ascertain whetherill-health be the occasion or not.  The poor soul must not bestifled.  Let those who thus suffer understand that they are ill;a change should be made in the hour of prayer, and oftentimesthat change should be continued for some days. Let souls pass outof this desert as they can, for it is very often the misery ofone that loves God to see itself living in such wretchedness,unable to do what it would, because it has to keep so evil aguest as the body.24. I spoke of discretion, because sometimes the devil will dothe same work; and so it is not always right to omit prayer whenthe understanding is greatly distracted and disturbed, nor totorment the soul to the doing of that which is out of its power.There are other things then to be done--exterior works, as ofcharity and spiritual reading--though at times the soul will notbe able to do them.  Take care, then, of the body, for the loveof God, because at many other times the body must serve the soul;and let recourse be had to some recreations--holy ones--such asconversation, or going out into the fields, as the confessorshall advise.  Altogether, experience is a great matter, and itmakes us understand what is convenient for us. Let God be servedin all things--His yoke is sweet; [7] and it is of greatimportance that the soul should not be dragged, as they say, butcarried gently, that it may make greater progress.25. So, then, I come back to what I advised before [8]--andthough I repeat it often, it matters not; it is of greatimportance that no one should distress himself on account ofaridities, or because his thoughts are restless and distracted;neither should he be afflicted thereat, if he would attain toliberty of spirit, and not be always in trouble.  Let him beginby not being afraid of the Cross, and he will see how our Lordwill help him to carry it, how joyfully he will advance, and whatprofit he will derive from it all.  It is now clear, if there isno water in the well, that we at least can put none into it.It is true we must not be careless about drawing it when there isany in it, because at that time it is the will of God to multiplyour virtues by means thereof.NOTES1.

ISFJ	 XII.What We Can Ourselves Do.  The Evil of Desiring to Attain toSupernatural States Before Our Lord Calls Us.1. My aim in the foregoing chapter--though I digressed to manyother matters, because they seemed to me very necessary--was toexplain how much we may attain to of ourselves; and how, in thesebeginnings of devotion, we are able in some degree to helpourselves: because thinking of, and pondering on, the sufferingsof our Lord for our sakes moves us to compassion, and the sorrowand tears which result therefrom are sweet.  The thought of theblessedness we hope for, of the love our Lord bore us, and of Hisresurrection, kindle within us a joy which is neither whollyspiritual nor wholly sensual; but the joy is virtuous, and thesorrow is most meritorious.2. Of this kind are all those things which produce a devotionacquired in part by means of the understanding, though it canneither be merited nor had, if God grants it not.  It is best fora soul which God has not raised to a higher state than this notto try to rise of itself.  Let this be well considered, becauseall the soul will gain in that way will be a loss.  In this stateit can make many acts of good resolutions to do much for God, andenkindle its love; other acts also, which may help the growth ofvirtues, according to that which is written in a book called TheArt of Serving God, [1] a most excellent work, and profitable forthose who are in this state, because the understanding isactive now.3. The soul may also place itself in the presence of Christ, andaccustom itself to many acts of love directed to His sacredHumanity, and remain in His presence continually, and speak toHim, pray to Him in its necessities, and complain to Him of itstroubles; be merry with Him in its joys, and yet not forget Himbecause of its joys.  All this it may do without set prayers, butrather with words befitting its desires and its needs.4. This is an excellent way whereby to advance, and that veryquickly.  He that will strive to have this preciouscompanionship, and will make much of it, and will sincerely loveour Lord, to whom we owe so much, is one, in my opinion, who hasmade some progress.  There is therefore no reason why we shouldtrouble ourselves because we have no sensible devotion, as I saidbefore. [2]  But let us rather give thanks to our Lord, whoallows us to have a desire to please Him, though our works bepoor. This practice of the presence of Christ is profitable inall states of prayer, and is a most safe way of advancing in thefirst state, and of attaining quickly to the second; and as forthe last states, it secures us against those risks which thedevil may occasion.5. This, then, is what we can do.  He who would pass out of thisstate, and upraise his spirit, in order to taste consolationsdenied him, will, in my opinion, lose both the one and theother. [3]  These consolations being supernatural, and theunderstanding inactive, the soul is then left desolate and ingreat aridity.  As the foundation of the whole building ishumility, the nearer we draw unto God the more this virtue shouldgrow; if it does not, everything is lost.  It seems to be a kindof pride when we seek to ascend higher, seeing that God descendsso low, when He allows us, being what we are, to draw nearunto Him.6. It must not be supposed that I am now speaking of raising ourthoughts to the consideration of the high things of heaven and ofits glory, or unto God and His great wisdom.  I never did thismyself, because I had not the capacity for it--as I saidbefore; [4] and I was so worthless, that, as to thinking even ofthe things of earth, God gave me grace to understand this truth:that in me it was no slight boldness to do so.  How much more,then, the thinking of heavenly things?  Others, however, willprofit in that way, particularly those who are learned; forlearning, in my opinion, is a great treasury in the matter ofthis exercise, if it be accompanied with humility.  I observedthis a few days ago in some learned men who had shortly beforemade a beginning, and had made great progress.  This is thereason why I am so very anxious that many learned men may becomespiritual. I shall speak of this by and by. [5]7. What I am saying--namely, let them not rise if God does notraise them--is the language of spirituality.  He will understandme who has had any experience; and I know not how to explain it,if what I have said does not make it plain.8. In mystical theology--of which I spoke before [6]--theunderstanding ceases from its acts, because God suspends it--as Ishall explain by and by, if I can; [7] and God give me the graceto do so.  We must neither imagine nor think that we can ofourselves bring about this suspension.  That is what I say mustnot be done; nor must we allow the understanding to cease fromits acts; for in that case we shall be stupid and cold, and theresult will be neither the one nor the other.  For when our Lordsuspends the understanding, and makes it cease from its acts, Heputs before it that which astonishes and occupies it: so thatwithout making any reflections, it shall comprehend in amoment [8] more than we could comprehend in many years with allthe efforts in the world.9. To have the powers of the mind occupied, and to think that youcan keep them at the same time quiet, is folly.  I repeat it,though it be not so understood, there is no great humility inthis; and, if it be blameless, it is not left unpunished--it islabour thrown away, and the soul is a little disgusted: it feelslike a man about to take a leap, and is held back.  Such a oneseems to have used up his strength already, and finds himselfunable to do that which he wished to have done: so here, in thescanty gain that remains, he who will consider the matter willtrace that slight want of humility of which I have spoken; [9]for that virtue has this excellence: there is no good workattended by humility that leaves the soul disgusted.  It seems tome that I have made this clear enough; yet, after all, perhapsonly for myself.  May our Lord open their eyes who read this, bygiving them experience; and then however slight that experiencemay be, they will immediately understand it.10. For many years I read much, and understood nothing; and for along time, too, though God gave me understanding herein, I nevercould utter a word by which I might explain it to others.This was no little trouble to me.  When His Majesty pleases, Heteaches everything in a moment, so that I am lost in wonder.One thing I can truly say: though I conversed with many spiritualpersons, who sought to make me understand what our Lord wasgiving me, in order that I might be able to speak of it, the factis, that my dulness was so great, that I derived no advantagewhatever, much or little, from their teaching.11. Or it may be, as His Majesty has always been my Master--mayHe be blessed for ever! for I am ashamed of myself that I can sayso with truth--that it was His good pleasure I should meet withno one to whom I should be indebted in this matter.  So, withoutmy wishing or asking it--I never was careful about this, for thatwould have been a virtue in me, but only about vanity--God gaveme to understand with all distinctness in a moment, and alsoenabled me to express myself, so that my confessors wereastonished but I more than they, because I knew my own dulnessbetter.  It is not long since this happened.  And so that whichour Lord has not taught me, I seek not to know it, unless it be amatter that touches my conscience.12. Again I repeat my advice: it is of great moment not to raiseour spirit ourselves, if our Lord does not raise it for us; andif He does, there can be no mistaking it.  For women, it isspecially wrong, because the devil can delude them--though I amcertain our Lord will never allow him to hurt any one who laboursto draw near unto God in humility.  On the contrary, such a onewill derive more profit and advantage out of that attack by whichSatan intended to hurt him.13. I have dwelt so long upon this matter because this way ofprayer is the most common with beginners, and because the adviceI have given is very important.  It will be found much bettergiven elsewhere: that I admit; and I admit, also, that in writingit I am ashamed of myself, and covered with confusion--though notso much so as I ought to be.  Blessed for ever be our Lord, ofwhose will and pleasure it is that I am allowed, being what I am,to speak of things which are His, of such a nature, and so deep.1.

ISFJ	 XIII.Of Certain Temptations of Satan.  Instructions Relating Thereto.1. I have thought it right to speak of certain temptations I haveobserved to which beginners are liable--some of them I have hadmyself--and to give some advice about certain things which to meseem necessary.  In the beginning, then, we should strive to becheerful and unconstrained; for there are people who think it isall over with devotion if they relax themselves ever so little.It is right to be afraid of self; so that, having no confidencein ourselves, much or little, we may not place ourselves in thosecircumstances wherein men usually sin against God; for it is amost necessary fear, till we become very perfect in virtue.And there are not many who are so perfect as to be able to relaxthemselves on those occasions which offer temptations to theirnatural temper; for always while we live, were it only topreserve humility, it is well we should know our own miserablenature; but there are many occasions on which it is permittedus--as I said just now [1]--to take some recreation, in orderthat we may with more vigour resume our prayer.2. Discretion is necessary throughout.  We must have greatconfidence; because it is very necessary for us not to contractour desires, but put our trust in God; for, if we do violence toourselves by little and little, we shall, though not at once,reach that height which many Saints by His grace have reached.If they had never resolved to desire, and had never by little andlittle acted upon that resolve, they never could have ascended toso high a state.3. His Majesty seeks and loves courageous souls; but they must behumble in their ways, and have no confidence in themselves.I never saw one of those lag behind on the road; and never acowardly soul, though aided by humility, make that progress inmany years which the former makes in a few.  I am astonished atthe great things done on this road by encouraging oneself toundertake great things, though we may not have the strength forthem at once; the soul takes a flight upwards and ascends high,though, like a little bird whose wings are weak, it grows wearyand rests.4. At one time I used often to think of those words of St. Paul:'That all things are possible in God.' [2]  I saw clearly that ofmyself I could do nothing.  This was of great service to me.So also was the saying of St. Augustine: 'Give me, O Lord, whatThou commandest, and command what Thou wilt.' [3]  I was oftenthinking how St. Peter lost nothing by throwing himself into thesea, though he was afterwards afraid. [4]  These firstresolutions are a great matter--although it is necessary in thebeginning that we should be very reserved, controlled by thediscretion and authority of a director; but we must take carethat he be one who does not teach us to crawl like toads, nor onewho may be satisfied when the soul shows itself fit only to catchlizards.  Humility must always go before: so that we may knowthat this strength can come out of no strength of our own.5. But it is necessary we should understand what manner ofhumility this should be, because Satan, I believe, does greatharm; for he hinders those who begin to pray from going onwards,by suggesting to them false notions of humility.  He makes themthink it is pride to have large desires, to wish to imitate theSaints, and to long for martyrdom.  He tells us forthwith, or hemakes us think, that the actions of the Saints are to be admired,not to be imitated, by us who are sinners.  I, too, say the samething; but we must see what those actions are which we are toadmire, and what those are which we are to imitate; for it wouldbe wrong in a person who is weak and sickly to undertake muchfasting and sharp penances to retire into the desert, where hecould not sleep, nor find anything to eat; or, indeed, toundertake any austerities of this kind.6. But we ought to think that we can force ourselves, by thegrace of God, to hold the world in profound contempt--to makelight of honour, and be detached from our possessions.Our hearts, however, are so mean that we think the earth wouldfail us under our feet, if we were to cease to care even for amoment for the body, and give ourselves up to spirituality.Then we think that to have all we require contributes torecollection, because anxieties disturb prayer.  It is painful tome that our confidence in God is so scanty, and our self-love sostrong, as that any anxiety about our own necessities shoulddisturb us. But so it is; for when our spiritual progress is soslight, a mere nothing will give us as much trouble as great andimportant matters will give to others.  And we thinkourselves spiritual!7. Now, to me, this way of going on seems to betray a dispositionto reconcile soul and body together, in order that we may notmiss our ease in this world, and yet have the fruition of God inthe next; and so it will be if we walk according to justice,clinging to virtue; but it is the pace of a hen--it will neverbring us to liberty of spirit.  It is a course of proceeding, asit seems to me, most excellent for those who are in the marriedstate, and who must live according to their vocation; but for theother state, I by no means wish for such a method of progress,neither can I be made to believe it to be sound; for I have triedit, and I should have remained in that way, if our Lord in Hisgoodness had not taught me another and a shorter road.8. Though, in the matter of desires, I always had generous ones;but I laboured, as I said before, [5] to make my prayer, and, atthe same time, to live at my ease.  If there had been any one torouse me to a higher flight, he might have brought me, so Ithink, to a state in which these desires might have had theireffects; but, for our sins, so few and so rare are they whosediscretion in that matter is not excessive.  That, I believe, isreason enough why those who begin do not attain more quickly togreat perfection; for our Lord never fails us, and it is not Hisfault; the fault and the wretchedness of this being all our own.9. We may also imitate the Saints by striving after solitude andsilence, and many other virtues that will not kill these wretchedbodies of ours, which insist on being treated so orderly, thatthey may disorder the soul; and Satan, too, helps much to makethem unmanageable.  When he sees us a little anxious about them,he wants nothing more to convince us that our way of life mustkill us, and destroy our health; even if we weep, he makes usafraid of blindness.  I have passed through this, and therefore Iknow it; but I know of no better sight or better health that wecan desire, than the loss of both in such a cause. Being myselfso sickly, I was always under constraint, and good for nothing,till I resolved to make no account of my body nor of my health;even now I am worthless enough.10. But when it pleased God to let me find out this device ofSatan, I used to say to the latter, when he suggested to me thatI was ruining my health, that my death was of no consequence;when he suggested rest, I replied that I did not want rest, butthe Cross.  His other suggestions I treated in the same way.I saw clearly that in most things, though I was really verysickly, it was either a temptation of Satan, or a weakness on mypart. My health has been much better since I have ceased to lookafter my ease and comforts.  It is of great importance not to letour own thoughts frighten us in the beginning, when we setourselves to pray.  Believe me in this, for I know it byexperience.  As a warning to others, it may be that this story ofmy failures may be useful.11. There is another temptation, which is very common: whenpeople begin to have pleasure in the rest and the fruit ofprayer, they will have everybody else be very spiritual also.Now, to desire this is not wrong, but to try to bring it aboutmay not be right, except with great discretion and with muchreserve, without any appearance of teaching.  He who would do anygood in this matter ought to be endowed with solid virtues, thathe may not put temptation in the way of others.  It happened tome--that is how I know it--when, as I said before, [6] I madeothers apply themselves to prayer, to be a source of temptationand disorder; for, on the one hand, they heard me say greatthings of the blessedness of prayer, and, on the other, saw howpoor I was in virtue, notwithstanding my prayer.  They had goodreasons on their side, and afterwards they told me of it; forthey knew not how these things could be compatible one with theother.  This it was that made them not to regard that as evilwhich was really so in itself, namely, that they saw me do itmyself, now and then, during the time that they thought well ofme in some measure.12. This is Satan's work: he seems to take advantage of thevirtues we may have, for the purpose of giving a sanction, so faras he can, to the evil he aims at; how slight soever that evilmay be, his gain must be great, if it prevail in a religioushouse.  How much, then, must his gain have been, when the evil Idid was so very great!  And thus, during many years, only threepersons were the better for what I said to them; but now that ourLord has made me stronger in virtue, in the course of two orthree years many persons have profited, as I shallshow hereafter. [7]13. There is another great inconvenience in addition to this: theloss to our own soul; for the utmost we have to do in thebeginning is to take care of our own soul only, and consider thatin the whole world there is only God and our soul.  This is apoint of great importance.14. There is another temptation--we ought to be aware of it, andbe cautious in our conduct: persons are carried away by a zealfor virtue, through the pain which the sight of the sins andfailings of others occasions them.  Satan tells them that thispain arises only out of their desire that God may not beoffended, and out of their anxiety about His honour; so theyimmediately seek to remedy the evil.  This so disturbs them, thatthey cannot pray.  The greatest evil of all is their thinkingthis an act of virtue, of perfection, and of a great zeal forGod.  I am not speaking of the pain which public sins occasion,if they be habitual in any community, nor of wrongs done to theChurch, nor of heresies by which so many souls are visibly lost;for this pain is most wholesome, and being wholesome is no sourceof disquiet.  The security, therefore, of that soul which wouldapply itself to prayer lies in casting away from itself allanxiety about persons and things, in taking care of itself, andin pleasing God.  This is the most profitable course.15. If I were to speak of the mistakes which I have seen peoplemake, in reliance on their own good intentions, I should nevercome to an end.  Let us labour, therefore, always to consider thevirtues and the good qualities which we discern in others, andwith our own great sins cover our eyes, so that we may see noneof their failings.  This is one way of doing our work; and thoughwe may not be perfect in it at once, we shall acquire one greatvirtue--we shall look upon all men as better than ourselves; andwe begin to acquire that virtue in this way, by the grace of God,which is necessary in all things--for when we have it not, allour endeavours are in vain--and by imploring Him to give us thisvirtue; for He never fails us, if we do what we can.16. This advice, also, they must take into their considerationwho make much use of their understanding, eliciting from onesubject many thoughts and conceptions.  As to those who, likemyself, cannot do it, I have no advice to give, except that theyare to have patience, until our Lord shall send them both matterand light; for they can do so little of themselves, that theirunderstanding is a hindrance to them rather than a help.17. To those, then, who can make use of their understanding, Isay that they are not to spend the whole time in that way; forthough it be most meritorious, yet they must not, when prayer issweet, suppose that there never will be a Sunday or a time whenno work ought to be done.  They think it lost time to dootherwise; but I think that loss their greatest gain.  Let themrather, as I have said, [8] place themselves in the presence ofChrist, and, without fatiguing the understanding, converse withHim, and in Him rejoice, without wearying themselves in searchingout reasons; but let them rather lay their necessities beforeHim, and the just reasons there are why He should not suffer usin His presence: at one time this, at another time that, lest thesoul should be wearied by always eating of the same food.  Thesemeats are most savoury and wholesome, if the palate be accustomedto them; they will furnish a great support for the life of thesoul, and they have many other advantages also.18. I will explain myself further; for the doctrine of prayer isdifficult, and, without a director, very hard to understand.Though I would willingly be concise, and though a mere hint isenough for his clear intellect who has commanded me to write onthe subject of prayer, yet so it is, my dulness does not allow meto say or explain in a few words that which it is so important toexplain well.  I, who have gone through so much, am sorry forthose who begin only with books; for there is a strangedifference between that which we learn by reading, and that whichwe learn by experience.19. Going back, then, to what I was saying.  We set ourselves tomeditate upon some mystery of the Passion: let us say, our Lordat the pillar.  The understanding goeth about seeking for thesources out of which came the great dolours and the bitteranguish which His Majesty endured in that desolation.It considers that mystery in many lights, which the intellect, ifit be skilled in its work, or furnished with learning, may thereobtain.  This is a method of prayer which should be to everyonethe beginning, the middle, and the end: a most excellent and safeway, until our Lord shall guide them to other supernatural ways.20. I say to all, because there are many souls who make greaterprogress by meditation on other subjects than on the SacredPassion; for as there are many mansions in heaven, so there arealso many roads leading thither.  Some persons advance byconsidering themselves in hell, others in heaven--and these aredistressed by meditations on hell.  Others meditate on death;some persons, if tender-hearted, are greatly fatigued bycontinual meditations on the Passion; but are consoled and makeprogress when they meditate on the power and greatness of God inHis creatures, and on His love visible in all things.  This is anadmirable method--not omitting, however, from time to time, thePassion and Life of Christ, the Source of all good that evercame, and that ever shall come.21. He who begins is in need of instruction, whereby he mayascertain what profits him most.  For this end it is verynecessary he should have a director, who ought to be a person ofexperience; for if he be not, he will make many mistakes, anddirect a soul without understanding its ways, or suffering it tounderstand them itself; for such a soul, knowing that obedienceto a director is highly meritorious, dares not transgress thecommandments it receives.  I have met with souls cramped andtormented, because he who directed them had no experience: thatmade me sorry for them.  Some of them knew not what to do withthemselves; for directors who do not understand the spirit oftheir penitents afflict them soul and body, and hindertheir progress. [9]22. One person I had to do with had been kept by her director foreight years, as it were, in prison; he would not allow her toquit the subject of self-knowledge; and yet our Lord had alreadyraised her to the prayer of quiet; so she had much to suffer.23. Although this matter of self-knowledge must never be putaside--for there is no soul so great a giant on this road but hasfrequent need to turn back, and be again an infant at the breast;and this must never be forgotten.  I shall repeat it, [10]perhaps, many times, because of its great importance--for amongall the states of prayer, however high they may be, there is notone in which it is not often necessary to go back to thebeginning.  The knowledge of our sins, and of our own selves, isthe bread which we have to eat with all the meats, howeverdelicate they may be, in the way of prayer; without this bread,life cannot be sustained, though it must be taken by measure.When a soul beholds itself resigned, and clearly understands thatthere is no goodness in it--when it feels itself abashed in thepresence of so great a King, and sees how little it pays of thegreat debt it owes Him--why should it be necessary for it towaste its time on this subject?  Why should it not rather proceedto other matters which our Lord places before it, and forneglecting which there is no reason?  His Majesty surely knowsbetter than we do what kind of food is proper for us.24. So, then, it is of great consequence that the director shouldbe prudent--I mean, of sound understanding--and a man ofexperience.  If, in addition to this, he is a learned man, it isa very great matter.  But if these three qualities cannot be hadtogether, the first two are the most important, because learnedmen may be found with whom we can communicate when it isnecessary.  I mean, that for beginners learned men are of littleuse, if they are not men of prayer.  I do not say that they areto have nothing to do with learned men, because a spirituality,the foundations of which are not resting on the truth, I wouldrather were not accompanied with prayer.  Learning is a greatthing, for it teaches us who know so little, and enlightens us;so when we have come to the knowledge of the truths contained inthe holy writings, we do what we ought to do.  From sillydevotions, God deliver us!25. I will explain myself further, for I am meddling, I believe,with too many matters.  It has always been my failing that Icould never make myself understood--as I said before [11]--but atthe cost of many words.  A nun begins to practise prayer; if herdirector be silly, and if he should take it into his head, hewill make her feel that it is better for her to obey him than herown superior.  He will do all this without any evil purpose,thinking that he is doing right.  For if he be not a religioushimself, he will think this right enough.  If his penitent be amarried woman, he will tell her that it is better for her to giveherself unto prayer, when she ought to attend to her house,although she may thereby displease her husband.  And so it is, heknows not how to make arrangements for time and business, so thateverything may be done as it ought to be done; he has no lighthimself, and can therefore give none to others, however much hemay wish to do so.26. Though learning does not seem necessary for discretion, myopinion has always been, and will be, that every Christian shouldcontinue to be guided by a learned director if he can, and themore learned the better.  They who walk in the way of prayer havethe greater need of learning; and the more spiritual they are thegreater is that need.  Let them not say that learned men notgiven to prayer are not fit counsellors for those who pray: thatis a delusion.  I have conversed with many; and now for someyears I have sought them the more, because of my greater need ofthem.  I have always been fond of them; for though some of themhave no experience, they do not dislike spirituality, neither arethey ignorant of what it is, because in the sacred writings withwhich they are familiar they always find the truth aboutspirituality.  I am certain myself that a person given to prayer,who treats of these matters with learned men, unless he isdeceived with his own consent, will never be carried away by anyillusions of the devil.  I believe that the evil spirits areexceedingly afraid of learned men who are humble and virtuous,knowing that they will be found out and defeated by them.27. I have said this because there are opinions held to theeffect that learned men, if they are not spiritual, are notsuited for persons given to prayer.  I have just said that aspiritual director is necessary; but if he be not a learned man,he is a great hindrance.  It will help us much if we consultthose who are learned, provided they be virtuous; even if they benot spiritual, they will be of service to me, and God will enablethem to understand what they should teach; He will even make themspiritual, in order that they may help us on.  I do not say thiswithout having had experience of it; and I have met with morethan two.28. I say, then, that a person who shall resign his soul to bewholly subject to one director will make a great mistake, if heis in religion, unless he finds a director of this kind, becauseof the obedience due to his own superior.  His director may bedeficient in the three requisites I speak of, [12] and that willbe no slight cross, without voluntarily subjecting theunderstanding to one whose understanding is none of the best.At least, I have never been able to bring myself to do it,neither does it seem to me to be right.29. But if he be a person living in the world, let him praise Godfor the power he has of choosing whom he will obey, and let himnot lose so excellent a liberty; yea, rather let him be without adirector till he finds him--for our Lord will give him one, if heis really humble, and has a desire to meet with the right person.I praise God greatly--we women, and those who are unlearned,ought always to render Him unceasing thanks--because there arepersons who, by labours so great, have attained to the truth, ofwhich we unlearned people are ignorant. I often wonder at learnedmen--particularly those who are in religion--when I think of thetrouble they have had in acquiring that which they communicate tome for my good, and that without any more trouble to me than theasking for it.  And yet there are people who will not takeadvantage of their learning: God grant it may not be so!30. I see them undergo the poverty of the religious life, whichis great, together with its penances, its meagre food, the yokeof obedience, which makes me ashamed of myself at times; and withall this, interrupted sleep, trials everywhere, everywhere theCross.  I think it would be a great evil for any one to lose sogreat a good by his own fault.  It may be some of us, who areexempted from these burdens--who have our food put into ourmouths, as they say, and live at our ease--may think, because wegive ourselves a little more to prayer, that we are raised abovethe necessity of such great hardships.  Blessed be Thou, O Lord,who hast made me so incapable and so useless; but I bless Theestill more for this--that Thou quickenest so many to quicken us.Our prayer must therefore be very earnest for those who give uslight.  What should we be without them in the midst of theseviolent storms which now disturb the Church?  If some havefallen, the good will shine more and more. [13]  May it pleaseour Lord to hold them in His hand, and help them, that they mayhelp us.31. I have gone far away from the subject I began to speak of;but all is to the purpose for those who are beginners, that theymay begin a journey which is so high in such a way as that theyshall go on by the right road.  Coming back, then, to what Ispoke of before, [14] the meditation on Christ bound to thepillar, it is well we should make reflections for a time, andconsider the sufferings He there endured, for whom He enduredthem, who He is who endured them, and the love with which He borethem.  But a person should not always fatigue himself in makingthese reflections, but rather let him remain there with Christ,in the silence of the understanding.32. If he is able, let him employ himself in looking upon Christ,who is looking upon him; let him accompany Him, and make hispetitions to Him; let him humble himself, and delight himself inChrist, and keep in mind that he never deserved to be there.When he shall be able to do this, though it may be in thebeginning of his prayer, he will find great advantage; and thisway of prayer brings great advantages with it--at least, so mysoul has found it.  I do not know whether I am describing itaright; you, my father, will see to it.  May our Lord grant me toplease Him rightly for ever!  Amen.1. Ch. xi. § 24.2. Philipp. iv. 13; 'Omnia possum in Eo.'3.

ISFJ	 XIV.The Second State of Prayer.  Its Supernatural Character.1. Having spoken of the toilsome efforts and of the strengthrequired for watering the garden when we have to draw the waterout of the well, let us now speak of the second manner of drawingthe water, which the Lord of the vineyard has ordained; of themachine of wheel and buckets whereby the gardener may draw morewater with less labour, and be able to take some rest withoutbeing continually at work.  This, then, is what I am now going todescribe; and I apply it to the prayer called the prayerof quiet.2. Herein the soul begins to be recollected; it is now touchingon the supernatural--for it never could by any efforts of its ownattain to this.  True, it seems at times to have been wearied atthe wheel, labouring with the understanding, and filling thebuckets; but in this second degree the water is higher, andaccordingly the labour is much less than it was when the waterhad to be drawn up out of the well; I mean, that the water isnearer to it, for grace reveals itself more distinctly tothe soul.3. This is a gathering together of the faculties of the soulwithin itself, in order that it may have the fruition of thatcontentment in greater sweetness; but the faculties are not lost,neither are they asleep: the will alone is occupied in such a waythat, without knowing how it has become a captive, it gives asimple consent to become the prisoner of God; for it knows wellwhat is to be the captive of Him it loves.  O my Jesus and myLord, how pressing now is Thy love! [1]  It binds our love inbonds so straitly, that it is not in its power at this moment tolove anything else but Thee.4. The other two faculties help the will, that it may renderitself capable of the fruition of so great a good; nevertheless,it occasionally happens, even when the will is in union, thatthey hinder it very much: but then it should never heed them atall, simply abiding in its fruition and quiet. [2]  For if ittried to make them recollected, it would miss its way togetherwith them, because they are at this time like doves which are notsatisfied with the food the master of the dovecot gives themwithout any labouring for it on their part, and which go forth inquest of it elsewhere, and so hardly find it that they come back.And so the memory and the understanding come and go, seekingwhether the will is going to give them that into the fruition ofwhich it has entered itself.5. If it be our Lord's pleasure to throw them any food, theystop; if not, they go again to seek it.  They must be thinkingthat they are of some service to the will; and now and then thememory or the imagination, seeking to represent to it that ofwhich it has the fruition, does it harm.  The will, therefore,should be careful to deal with them as I shall explain.Everything that takes place now in this state brings the verygreatest consolation; and the labour is so slight, that prayer,even if persevered in for some time, is never wearisome.The reason is, that the understanding is now working very gently,and is drawing very much more water than it drew out of the well.The tears, which God now sends, flow with joy; though we feelthem, they are not the result of any efforts of our own.6. This water of grand blessings and graces, which our Lord nowsupplies, makes the virtues thrive much more, beyond allcomparison, than they did in the previous state of prayer; forthe soul is already ascending out of its wretched state, and somelittle knowledge of the blissfulness of glory is communicated toit.  This, I believe, is it that makes the virtues grow the more,and also to draw nearer to essential virtue, God Himself, fromWhom all virtues proceed; for His Majesty has begun tocommunicate Himself to this soul, and will have it feel how He iscommunicating Himself.7. As soon as the soul has arrived thus far, it begins to losethe desire of earthly things, [3] and no wonder; for it seesclearly that, even for a moment, this joy is not to be had onearth; that there are no riches, no dominion, no honours, nodelights, that can for one instant, even for the twinkling of aneye, minister such a joy; for it is a true satisfaction, and thesoul sees that it really does satisfy.  Now, we who are on earth,as it seems to me, scarcely ever understand wherein oursatisfaction lies, for it is always liable to disappointment; butin this, at that time, there is none: the disappointment comethafterwards, when the soul sees that all is over, and that it hasno power to recover it, neither does it know how; for if it cutitself in pieces by penance and prayer, and every other kind ofausterities, all would be of little use, if our Lord did notgrant it.  God, in His great mercy, will have the soul comprehendthat His Majesty is so near to it, that it need not sendmessengers to Him, but may speak to Him itself, and not with aloud crying, because so near is He already, that He understandseven the movements of its lips.8. It seems absurd to say this, seeing that we know that Godunderstands us always, and is present with us.  It is so, andthere can be no doubt of it; but our Emperor and Lord will haveus now understand that He understands us; and also have usunderstand what His presence bringeth about, and that He means ina special way to begin a work in the soul, which is manifested inthe great joy, inward and outward, which He communicates, and inthe difference there is, as I said just now, between this joy anddelight and all the joys of earth; for He seems to be filling upthe void in our souls occasioned by our sins.9. This satisfaction lies in the innermost part of the soul, andthe soul knows not whence, nor how, it came, very often it knowsnot what to do, or wish, or pray for.  It seems to find all thisat once, and knoweth not what it hath found; nor do I know how toexplain it, because learning is necessary for many things.  Here,indeed, learning would be very much to the purpose, in order toexplain the general and particular helps of grace; for there aremany who know nothing about them.  Learning would serve to showhow our Lord now will have the soul to see, as it were, with thenaked eye, as men speak, this particular help of grace, and bealso useful in many other ways wherein I am likely to go astray.But as what I write is to be seen by those who have the learningto discover whether I make mistakes or not, I go on withoutanxiety; for I know I need have none whatever about either theletter or the spirit, because it is in their power to whom it isto be sent to do with it as they will: they will understand it,and blot out whatever may be amiss.10. I should like them to explain this, because it is a principalpoint, and because a soul, when our Lord begins to bestow thesegraces upon it, does not understand them, and does not know whatto do with itself; for if God leads it by the way of fear, as Heled me, its trial will be heavy, if there be no one whounderstands the state it is in; and to see itself as in a pictureis a great comfort; and then it sees clearly that it istravelling on that road.  The knowledge of what it has to do is agreat blessing for it, so that it may advance forwards in everyone of these degrees of prayer; for I have suffered greatly, andlost much time, because I did not know what to do; and I am verysorry for those souls who find themselves alone when they come tothis state; for though I read many spiritual books, wherein thisvery matter is discussed, they threw very little light upon it.And if it be not a soul much exercised in prayer, it will find itenough to understand its state, be the books ever so clear.11. I wish much that our Lord would help me to describe theeffects on the soul of these things, now that they begin to besupernatural, so that men might know by these effects whetherthey come from the Spirit of God.  I mean, known as things areknown here below--though it is always well to live in fear, andon our guard; for even if they do come from God, now and then thedevil will be able to transform himself into an angel oflight; [4] and the soul, if not experienced herein, will notunderstand the matter; and it must have so much experience forthe understanding thereof, that it is necessary it should haveattained to the highest perfection of prayer.12. The little time I have helps me but little, and it istherefore necessary His Majesty should undertake it Himself; forI have to live in community, and have very many things to employme, as I am in a house which is newly founded--as will appearhereafter; [5] and so I am writing, with very many interruptions,by little and little at a time.  I wish I had leisure; for whenour Lord gives the spirit, it is more easily and better done; itis then as with a person working embroidery with the patternbefore her; but if the spirit be wanting, there is no moremeaning in the words than in gibberish, so to speak, though manyyears may have been spent in prayer.  And thus I think it a verygreat advantage to be in this state of prayer when I am writingthis; for I see clearly that it is not I who speak, nor is it Iwho with her understanding has arranged it; and afterwards I donot know how I came to speak so accurately. [6]  It has oftenhappened to me thus.13. Let us now return to our orchard, or flower-garden, andbehold now how the trees begin to fill with sap for the bringingforth of the blossoms, and then of the fruit--the flowers and theplants, also, their fragrance.  This illustration pleases me; forvery often, when I was beginning--and our Lord grant that I havereally begun to serve His Majesty--I mean, begun in relation towhat I have to say of my life,--it was to me a great joy toconsider my soul as a garden, and our Lord as walking in it.I used to beseech Him to increase the fragrance of the littleflowers of virtues--which were beginning, as it seemed tobud--and preserve them, that they might be to His glory; for Idesired nothing for myself.  I prayed Him to cut those He liked,because I already knew that they would grow the better.14. I say cut; for there are times in which the soul has norecollection of this garden--everything seems parched, and thereis no water to be had for preserving it--and in which it seems asif the soul had never possessed any virtue at all.  This is theseason of heavy trials; for our Lord will have the poor gardenersuppose all the trouble he took in maintaining and watering thegarden to have been taken to no purpose.  Then is the time reallyfor weeding and rooting out every plant, however small it may be,that is worthless, in the knowledge that no efforts of ours aresufficient, if God withholds from us the waters of His grace; andin despising ourselves as being nothing, and even less thannothing.  In this way we gain great humility--the flowersgrow afresh.15. O my Lord and my Good!  I cannot utter these words withouttears, and rejoicing in my soul; for Thou wilt be thus with us,and art with us, in the Sacrament.  We may believe so most truly;for so it is, and the comparison I make is a great truth; and, ifour sins stand not in the way, we may rejoice in Thee, becauseThou rejoicest in us; for Thou hast told us that Thy delight isto be with the children of men. [7]  O my Lord, what does itmean?  Whenever I hear these words, they always give me greatconsolation, and did so even when I was most wicked.16. Is it possible, 0 Lord, that there can be a soul which, afterattaining to this state wherein Thou bestowest upon it the likegraces and consolations, and wherein it understands that Thoudelightest to be with it, can yet fall back and offend Thee afterso many favours, and such great demonstrations of the love Thoubearest it, and of which there cannot be any doubt, because theeffect of it is so visible?  Such a soul there certainly is; forI have done so, not once, but often.  May it please Thy goodness,O Lord, that I may be alone in my ingratitude--the only one whohas committed so great an iniquity, and whose ingratitude hasbeen so immeasurable!  But even out of my ingratitude Thineinfinite goodness has brought forth some good; and the greater mywickedness, the greater the splendour of the great mercy of Thycompassions.  Oh, what reasons have I to magnify them for ever!17. May it be so, I beseech Thee, O my God, and may I sing ofthem for ever, now that Thou hast been pleased to show mercies sogreat unto me that they who see them are astonished, mercieswhich draw me out of myself continually, that I may praise Theemore and more! for, remaining in myself, without Thee, I could donothing, O my Lord, but be as the withered flowers of the garden;so that this miserable earth of mine becomes a heap of refuse, asit was before.  Let it not be so, O Lord!--let not a soul whichThou hast purchased with so many labours be lost, one which Thouhast so often ransomed anew, and delivered from between the teethof the hideous dragon!18. You, my father, must forgive me for wandering from thesubject; and, as I am speaking to the purpose I have in view, youmust not be surprised.  What I write is what my soul hasunderstood; and it is very often hard enough to abstain from thepraises of God when, in the course of writing, the great debt Iowe Him presents itself before me.  Nor do I think that it can bedisagreeable to you; because both of us, I believe, may sing thesame song, though in a different way; for my debt is much thegreater, seeing that God has forgiven me more, as you, myfather, know.1. 2 Cor. v. 14: 'Charitas enim Christi urget nos.'2. See ch. xvii. § 12; Way of Perfection, ch. liii., but xxxi. ofthe old editions.3. See Relation, i. § 12.4. 2 Cor. xi. 14: 'Ipse enim Satanas transfigurat se inangelum lucis.'5. See ch. x. § 11.  As that passage refers probably to themonastery of the Incarnation, this must refer to that ofSt. Joseph, newly founded in Avila; for that of the Incarnationwas founded a short time before the Saint was born; and she couldhardly say of it, now that she was at least in her forty-seventhyear, that it was newly founded.  The house, however, was poor;for she says, ch. xxxii. § 12, that the nuns occasionally quittedthe monastery for a time, because of its poverty.6. See ch. xviii. § 10.  In the second Report of the Rota,p. 477--quoted by Benedict XIV., De Canoniz. iii. 26, n. 12, andby the Bollandists in the Acta, 1315--we have these words, andthey throw great light on the text: 'Sunt et alli testes de visuaffirmantes quod quando beata Teresa scribebat libros, faciesejus resplendebat.'  In the information taken in Granada, theMother Anne of the Incarnation says she saw the Saint one night,while writing the Fortress of the Soul, with her face shining;and Mary of St. Francis deposes to the same effect in theinformations taken in Medina (De la Fuente,vol. ii. pp. 389, 392).7. Prov. viii. 31: 'Deliciæ meæ esse cum filiis hominum.'
ISFJ	 XV.Instructions for Those Who Have Attained to the Prayer of Quiet.Many Advance So Far, but Few Go Farther.1. Let us now go back to the subject.  This quiet andrecollection of the soul makes itself in great measure felt inthe satisfaction and peace, attended with very great joy andrepose of the faculties, and most sweet delight, wherein the soulis established. [1]  It thinks, because it has not gone beyondit, that there is nothing further to wish for, but that its abodemight be there, and it would willingly say so with St. Peter. [2]It dares not move nor stir, because it thinks that this blessingit has received must then escape out of its hands; now and then,it could wish it did not even breathe. [3]  The poor little soulis not aware that, as of itself it could do nothing to draw downthis blessing on itself, it is still less able to retain it amoment longer than our Lord wills it should remain.2. I have already said that, in the prior recollection andquiet, [4] there is no failure of the powers of the soul; but thesoul is so satisfied in God that, although two of its powers bedistracted, yet, while the recollection lasts, as the will abidesin union with God, so its peace and quiet are not disturbed; onthe contrary, the will by degrees brings the understanding andthe memory back again; for though the will is not yet altogetherabsorbed, it continues still occupied without knowing how, sothat, notwithstanding all the efforts of the memory and theunderstanding, they cannot rob it of its delight andjoy [5]--yea, rather, it helps without any labour at all to keepthis little spark of the love of God from being quenched.3. Oh, that His Majesty would be gracious unto me, and enable meto give a clear account of the matter; for many are the souls whoattain to this state, and few are they who go farther: and I knownot who is in fault; most certainly it is not God; for when HisMajesty shows mercy unto a soul, so that it advances so far, Ibelieve that He will not fail to be more merciful still, if therebe no shortcomings on our part.4. And it is of great importance for the soul that has advancedso far as this to understand the great dignity of its state, thegreat grace given it by our Lord, and how in all reason it shouldnot belong to earth; because He, of His goodness, seems to makeit here a denizen of heaven, unless it be itself in fault.And miserable will that soul be if it turns back; it will godown, I think so, even to the abyss, as I was going myself, ifthe mercy of our Lord had not brought me back; because, for themost part, it must be the effect of grave faults--that is myopinion: nor is it possible to forsake so great a good otherwisethan through the blindness occasioned by much evil.5. Therefore, for the love of our Lord, I implore those souls towhom His Majesty has given so great a grace--the attainment ofthis state--to know and make much of themselves, with a humbleand holy presumption, in order that they may never return to theflesh-pots of Egypt.  And if through weakness and wickedness, anda mean and wretched nature, they should fall, as I did, let themalways keep in mind the good they have lost; let them suspect andfear--they have reason to do so--that, if they do not resumetheir prayer, they may go on from bad to worse.  I call that areal fall which makes us hate the way by which so great a goodwas obtained.  I address myself to those souls; but I am notsaying that they will never offend God, nor fall intosin,--though there are good reasons why those who have receivedthese graces should keep themselves carefully from sin; but weare miserable creatures.  What I earnestly advise is this: letthere be no giving up of prayer; it is by prayer they willunderstand what they are doing, and obtain from our Lord thegrace to repent, and strength to rise again; they must believeand believe again that, if they cease from praying, they run--soI think--into danger.  I know not if I understand what I amsaying; for, as I said before, I measure others by myself. [6]6. The prayer of quiet, then, is a little spark of the true loveof Himself, which our Lord begins to enkindle in the soul; andHis will is, that the soul should understand what this love is bythe joy it brings.  This quiet and recollection and little spark,if it is the work of the Spirit of God, and not a sweetnesssupplied by Satan, or brought about by ourselves, produces greatresults.  A person of experience, however, cannot possibly failto understand at once that it is not a thing that can beacquired, were it not that our nature is so greedy of sweetness,that it seeks for it in every way.  But it becomes cold verysoon; for, however much we try to make the fire burn, in order toobtain this sweetness, it does not appear that we do anythingelse but throw water on it, to put it out.  This spark, then,given of God, however slight it may be, causes a great crackling;and if men do not quench it by their faults, it is the beginningof the great fire, which sends forth--I shall speak of it in theproper place [7]--the flames of that most vehement love of Godwhich His Majesty will have perfect souls to possess.7. This little spark is a sign or pledge which God gives to asoul, in token of His having chosen it for great things, if itwill prepare to receive them.  It is a great gift, much too greatfor me to be able to speak of it.  It is a great sorrow to me;because, as I said before, [8] I know that many souls come thusfar, and that those who go farther, as they ought to go, are sofew, that I am ashamed to say it.  I do not mean that they areabsolutely few: there must be many, because God is patient withus, for some reasons; I speak of what I have seen.8. I should like much to recommend these souls to take care thatthey do not hide their talent; for it may be that God has chosenthem to be the edification of many others, especially in thesedays, when the friends of God should be strong, in order thatthey may support the weak.  Those who discern in themselves thisgrace, must look upon themselves as such friends, if they wouldfulfil the law which even the honourable friendship of the worldrespects; if not, as I said just now, [9] let them fear andtremble, lest they should be doing mischief to themselves--andGod grant it be to themselves only!9. What the soul has to do at those seasons wherein it is raisedto the prayer of quiet is nothing more than to be gentle andwithout noise.  By noise, I mean going about with theunderstanding in search of words and reflections whereby to giveGod thanks for this grace, and heaping up its sins andimperfections together to show that it does not deserve it.All this commotion takes place now, and the understanding comesforward, and the memory is restless, and certainly to me thesepowers bring much weariness at times; for, though my memory isnot strong, I cannot control it.  Let the will quietly and wiselyunderstand that it is not by dint of labour on our part that wecan converse to any good purpose with God, and that our ownefforts are only great logs of wood, laid on without discretionto quench this little spark; and let it confess this, and inhumility say, O Lord, what can I do here? what has the servant todo with her Lord, and earth with heaven? or words of love thatsuggest themselves now, firmly grounded in the conviction thatwhat it says is truth; and let it make no account of theunderstanding, which is simply tiresome.10. And if the will wishes to communicate to the understandingany portion of that the fruition of which itself has entered on,or if it labours to make the understanding recollected, it shallnot succeed; for it will often happen that the will is in unionand at rest, while the understanding is in extreme disorder.It is better for it to leave it alone, and not to run after it--Iam speaking of the will; for the will should abide in thefruition of that grace, recollected itself, like the prudent bee;for if no bees entered the hive, and each of them wandered abroadin search of the rest, the honey would hardly be made.  In thesame way, the soul will lose much if it be not careful now,especially if the understanding be acute; for when it begins tomake reflections and search for reasons, it will think at oncethat it is doing something if its reasons and reflectionsare good.11. The only reason that ought to be admitted now is tounderstand clearly that there is no reason whatever, except Hismere goodness, why God should grant us so great a grace, and tobe aware that we are so near Him, and to pray to His Majesty formercies, to make intercession for the Church, for those who hadbeen recommended to us, and for the souls in purgatory,--not,however, with noise of words, but with a heartfelt desire to beheard.  This is a prayer that contains much, and by it more isobtained than by many reflections of the understanding.  Let thewill stir up some of those reasons, which proceed from reasonitself, to quicken its love, such as the fact of its being in abetter state, and let it make certain acts of love, as what itwill do for Him to whom it owes so much,--and that, as I saidjust now, without any noise of the understanding, in the searchafter profound reflections.  A little straw,--and it will be lessthan straw, if we bring it ourselves,--laid on with humility,will be more effectual here, and will help to kindle a fire morethan many fagots of most learned reasons, which, in my opinion,will put it out in a moment.12. This is good for those learned men who have commanded me towrite, [10] and who all, by the goodness of God, have come tothis state; for it may be that they spend the time in makingapplications of passages of the Scriptures.  And though learningcould not fail to be of great use to them, both before and afterprayer, still, in the very time of prayer itself, there is littlenecessity for it, in my opinion, unless it be for the purpose ofmaking the will tepid; for the understanding then, because of itsnearness to the light, is itself illuminated; so that even I, whoam what I am, seem to be a different person.  And so it is; forit has happened to me, who scarcely understand a word of what Iread in Latin, and specially in the Psalms, when in the prayer ofquiet, not only to understand the Latin as if it were Spanish,but, still more, to take a delight in dwelling on the meaning ofthat I knew through the Spanish.  We must make an exception: ifthese learned men have to preach or to teach, they will do wellto take advantage of their learning, that they may help poorpeople of little learning, of whom I am one.  Charity is a greatthing; and so always is ministering unto souls, when done simplyfor God.13. So, then, when the soul is in the prayer of quiet, let itrepose in its rest--let learning be put on one side.  The timewill come when they may make use of it in the service of ourLord--when they that possess it will appreciate it so highly asto be glad that they had not neglected it even for all thetreasures of the world, simply because it enables them to serveHis Majesty; for it is a great help.  But in the eyes of InfiniteWisdom, believe me, a little striving after humility, and asingle act thereof, are worth more than all the science in theworld.  This is not the time for discussing, but forunderstanding plainly what we are, and presenting ourselves insimplicity before God, who will have the soul make itself as afool--as, indeed, it is--in His presence, seeing that His Majestyso humbles Himself as to suffer it to be near Him, we being whatwe are.14. Moreover, the understanding bestirs itself to make itsthanksgiving in phrases well arranged; but the will, in peace,not daring to lift up its eyes with the publican, [11] makesperhaps a better act of thanksgiving than the understanding, withall the tropes of its rhetoric.  In a word, mental prayer is notto be abandoned altogether now, nor even vocal prayer, if at anytime we wish, or can, to make use of either of them; for if thestate of quiet be profound, it becomes difficult to speak, and itcan be done only with great pain.15. I believe myself that we know whether this proceeds from theSpirit of God, or is brought about by endeavours of our own, inthe commencement of devotion which God gives; and we seek ofourselves, as I said before, [12] to pass onwards to this quietof the will.  Then, no effect whatever is produced; it is quicklyover, and aridity is the result.  If it comes from Satan, thepractised soul, in my opinion, will detect it, because it leavestrouble behind, and scant humility and poor dispositions forthose effects which are wrought if it comes from God; it leavesneither light in the understanding nor steadiness inthe truth. [13]16. Here Satan can do little or no harm, if the soul directs untoGod the joy and sweetness it then feels; and if it fixes thethoughts and desires on Him, according to the advice alreadygiven, the devil can gain nothing whatever--on the contrary, bythe permission of God, he will lose much by that very joy whichhe causes in the soul, because that joy will help the soul,inasmuch as it thinks the joy comes from God, to betake itselfoften to prayer in its desire for it.  And if the soul is humble,indifferent to, and detached from, all joy, however spiritual,and if it loves the cross, it will make no account of thesweetness which Satan sends.  But it cannot so deal with thatwhich comes from the Spirit of God; of that it will make much.Now, when Satan sends it, as he is nothing but a lie, and when hesees that the soul humbles itself through that joy andsweetness--and here, in all things relating to prayer andsweetness, we must be very careful to endeavour to make ourselveshumble,--Satan will not often repeat his work, when he sees thathe loses by it.17. For this and for many other reasons, when I was speaking ofthe first degree of prayer, and of the first method of drawingthe water, [14] I insisted upon it that the great affair of soulsis, when they begin to pray, to begin also to detach themselvesfrom every kind of joy, and to enter on it resolved only onhelping to carry the cross of Christ like good soldiers, willingto serve their King without present pay, because they are sure ofit at last, having their eyes directed to the true andeverlasting kingdom at the conquest of which we are aiming.18. It is a very great matter to have this always before oureyes, especially in the beginning; afterwards, it becomes soclear, that it is rather a matter of necessity to forget it, inorder to live on.  Now, labouring to keep in mind that all thingshere below are of short duration, that they are all nothing, thatthe rest we have here is to be accounted as none,--all this, Isay, seems to be exceedingly low; and so, indeed, it is,--becausethose who have gone on to greater perfection would look upon itas a reproach, and be ashamed of themselves, if they thought thatthey were giving up the goods of this world because they areperishable, or that they would not be glad to give them up forGod--even if they were to last for ever.  The greater theperfection of these persons, the greater their joy, and thegreater also would that joy be if the duration of these worldlygoods were greater.19. In these persons, thus far advanced, love is already grown,and love is that which does this work.  But as to beginners, tothem it is of the utmost importance, and they must not regardthis consideration as unbecoming, for the blessings to be gainedare great,--and that is why I recommend it so much to them; forthey will have need of it--even those who have attained to greatheights of prayer--at certain times, when God will try them, andwhen His Majesty seems to have forsaken them.20. I have said as much already, and I would not have itforgotten, [15] in this our life on earth, the growth of the soulis not like that of the body.  We, however, so speak of it--and,in truth, it does grow.  A youth that is grown up, whose body isformed, and who is become a man, does not ungrow, nor does hisbody lessen in size; but as to the soul, it so is by our Lord'swill, so far as I have seen it in my own experience,--but I knownothing of it in any other way.  It must be in order to humble usfor our greater good, and to keep us from being careless duringour exile; seeing that he who has ascended the higher has themore reason to be afraid, and to be less confident in himself.A time may come when they whose will is so wrapt up in the willof God--and who, rather than fall into a single imperfection,would undergo torture and suffer a thousand deaths--will find itnecessary, if they would be delivered from offending God, andfrom the commission of sin, to make use of the first armour ofprayer, to call to mind how everything is coming to an end, thatthere is a heaven and a hell, and to make use of otherreflections of that nature, when they find themselves assailed bytemptations and persecutions.21. Let us go back to what I was saying.  The great source of ourdeliverance from the cunning devices and the sweetness whichSatan sends is to begin with a resolution to walk in the way ofthe Cross from the very first, and not to desire any sweetness atall, seeing that our Lord Himself has pointed out to us the wayof perfection, saying, 'Take up thy cross and follow Me.' [16]He is our example; and whosoever follows His counsels only toplease Him has nothing to fear.  In the improvement which theydetect in themselves, they who do so will see that this is nowork of Satan and if they fall, they have a sign of the presenceof our Lord in their rising again at once.  They have othersigns, also, of which I am going to speak.22. When it is the work of the Spirit of God, there is nonecessity for going about searching for reasons, on the strengthof which we may elicit acts of humility and of shame, because ourLord Himself supplies them in a way very different from that bywhich we could acquire them by our own poor reflections, whichare as nothing in comparison with that real humility arising outof the light which our Lord here gives us, and which begets aconfusion of face that undoes us.  The knowledge with which Godsupplies us, in order that we may know that of ourselves we haveno good in us, is perfectly apprehended--and the more perfectly,the greater the graces.  It fills us with a great desire ofadvancing in prayer, and of never giving it up, whatever troublesmay arise.  The soul offers to suffer everything.  A certainsecurity, joined with humility and fear concerning our salvation,casts out servile fear at once from the soul, and in its placeplants a loyal fear [17] of more perfect growth. [18]  There is avisible beginning of a love of God, utterly divested of allself-interest, together with a longing after seasons of solitude,in order to obtain a greater fruition of this good.23. In short, not to weary myself, it is the beginning of allgood; the flowers have so thriven, that they are on the point ofbudding.  And this the soul sees most clearly, and it isimpossible to persuade it now that God was not with it, till itturns back upon itself, and beholds its own failings andimperfections.  Then it fears for everything; and it is well itshould do so--though there are souls whom the certain convictionthat God is with them benefits more than all the fear they mayever have.  If a soul love greatly, and is thankful naturally,the remembrance of the mercies of God makes it turn to Him moreeffectually than all the chastisements of hell it can everpicture to itself--at least, it was so with me, though I amso wicked.24. As I shall speak at greater length of the signs of a goodspirit [19]--it has cost me much labour to be clear about them--Ido not treat of them here.  I believe, too, that, with the helpof God, I shall be able to speak somewhat to the point,because--setting aside the experience I have had, and by which Ilearned much--I have had the help of some most learned men andpersons of great holiness, whom we may reasonably believe in thematter. Souls, therefore, are not to weary themselves so much asI did, when, by the goodness of our Lord, they may have come tothis state.1.

ISFJ	 XVI.The Third State of Prayer.  Deep Matters.  What the Soul Can DoThat Has Reached It.  Effects of the Great Graces of Our Lord.1. Let us now speak of the third water wherewith this garden iswatered,--water running from a river or from a brook,--wherebythe garden is watered with very much less trouble, although thereis some in directing the water. [1]  In this state our Lord willhelp the gardener, and in such a way as to be, as it were, theGardener Himself, doing all the work.  It is a sleep of thepowers of the soul, which are not wholly lost, nor yetunderstanding how they are at work.  The pleasure, sweetness, anddelight are incomparably greater than in the former state ofprayer; and the reason is, that the waters of grace have risen upto the neck of the soul, so that it can neither advance norretreat--nor does it know how to do so; it seeks only thefruition of exceeding bliss.  It is like a dying man with thecandle in his hand, on the point of dying the death desired.It is rejoicing in this agony with unutterable joy; to me itseems to be nothing else but a death, as it were, to all thethings of this world, and a fruition of God.  I know of no otherwords whereby to describe it or to explain it; neither does thesoul then know what to do,--for it knows not whether to speak orbe silent, whether it should laugh or weep.  It is a gloriousfolly, a heavenly madness, wherein true wisdom is acquired; andto the soul a kind of fruition most full of delight. [2]2. It is now some five or six years, I believe, since our Lordraised me to this state of prayer, in its fulness, and that morethan once,--and I never understood it, and never could explainit; and so I was resolved, when I should come thus far in mystory, to say very little or nothing at all.  I knew well enoughthat it was not altogether the union of all the faculties, andyet most certainly it was higher than the previous state ofprayer; but I confess that I could not determine and understandthe difference.3. The humility of your reverence, willing to be helped by asimplicity so great as mine, has been the cause, I believe, whyour Lord, to-day, after Communion, admitted me to this state ofprayer, without the power of going further, and suggested to methese comparisons, and taught me how to speak of it, and of whatthe soul must do therein.  Certainly, I was amazed, and in amoment understood it all.  I have often been thus, as it were,beside myself, drunk with love, and yet never could understandhow it was.  I knew well that it was the work of God, but I neverwas able to understand the manner of His working here; for, infact, the faculties are almost all completely in union, yet notso absorbed that they do not act.  I have been singularlydelighted in that I have been able to comprehend the matter atlast.  Blessed be our Lord, who has thus consoled me!4. The faculties of the soul now retain only the power ofoccupying themselves wholly with God; not one of them ventures tostir, neither can we move one of them without making greatefforts to distract ourselves--and, indeed, I do not think we cando it at all at this time.  Many words are then uttered in praiseof God--but disorderly, unless it be that our Lord orders themhimself.  At least, the understanding is utterly powerless here;the soul longs to send forth words of praise, but it has nocontrol over itself,--it is in a state of sweet restlessness.The flowers are already opening; they are beginning to send forththeir fragrance.5. The soul in this state would have all men behold and know ofits bliss, to the praise of God, and help it to praise Him.It would have them to be partakers of its joy; for its joy isgreater than it can bear.  It seems to me that it is like thewoman in the Gospel, who would, or used to, call in herneighbours. [3]  The admirable spirit of David, the royalprophet, must have felt in the same way, so it seems to me, whenhe played on the harp, singing the praises of God.  I have a verygreat devotion to this glorious king; [4] and I wish all had it,particularly those who are sinners like myself.6. O my God, what must that soul be when it is in this state?It wishes it were all tongue, in order that it may praise ourLord. It utters a thousand holy follies, striving continually toplease Him by whom it is thus possessed.  I know one [5] who,though she was no poet, yet composed, without any preparation,certain stanzas, full of feeling, most expressive of her pain:they were not the work of her own understanding; but, in order tohave a greater fruition of that bliss which so sweet a painoccasioned her, she complained of it in that way to God. She waswilling to be cut in pieces, soul and body, to show the delightshe felt in that pain.  To what torments could she be thenexposed, that would not be delicious to endure for her Lord?She sees clearly that the martyrs did little or nothing, so faras they were concerned, when they endured their tortures, becausethe soul is well aware that its strength is derived fromanother source.7. But what will be its sufferings when it returns to the use ofthe senses, to live in the world, and go back to the anxietiesand the fashions thereof?  I do not think that I have exaggeratedin any way, but rather have fallen short, in speaking of thatjoy, which our Lord, of His good pleasure, gives to the soul inthis its exile.  Blessed for ever be Thou, O Lord! and may allcreated things praise Thee for ever!8. O my King, seeing that I am now, while writing this, stillunder the power of this heavenly madness, an effect of Thy mercyand goodness,--and it is a mercy I never deserved,--grant, Ibeseech Thee, that all those with whom I may have to converse maybecome mad through Thy love, or let me converse with none, or soorder it that I may have nothing to do in the world, or take meaway from it.  This Thy servant, O my God, is no longer able toendure sufferings so great as those are which she must bear whenshe sees herself without Thee if she must live, she seeks norepose in this life,--and do Thou give her none.  This my soullongs to be free--eating is killing it, and sleep is wearisome;it sees itself wasting the time of this life in comforts, andthat there is no comfort for it now but in Thee; it seems to beliving contrary to nature--for now, it desires to live not initself, but in Thee.9. O my true Lord and my happiness! what a cross hast Thouprepared for those who attain to this state!--light and mostheavy at the same time: light, because sweet; heavy, because nowand then there is no patience left to endure it--and yet the soulnever wishes to be delivered from it, unless it be that it maycome to Thee.  When the soul remembers that it has never servedThee at all, and that by living on it may do Thee some service,it longs for a still heavier cross, and never to die before theend of the world.  Its own repose it counts as nothing incomparison with doing a slight service to Thee.  It knows notwhat to desire; but it clearly understands that it desiresnothing else but Thee.10. O my son, [6] so humble is he to whom this writing isdirected, and who has commanded me to write, that he suffershimself to be thus addressed,--you, my father, only must seethese things, in which I seem to have transgressed all bounds;for no reason can keep me reasonable when our Lord draws me outof myself.  Since my communion this morning, [7] I do not believethat I am the person who is speaking; I seem to be dreaming thethings I see, and I wish I might never see any but people ill, asI am now.  I beseech you, my father, let us all be mad, for thelove of Him who for our sakes suffered men to say of Him that Hewas mad. [8]11. You, my father, say that you wish me well.  I wish you wouldprove it by disposing yourself so that God may bestow this graceupon you; for I see very few people who have not too much sensefor everything they have to do: and it may be that I have morethan anybody else.  Your reverence must not allow it; you are myfather, for you are my confessor, and the person to whom I havetrusted my soul; disperse my delusions by telling the truth; fortruths of this sort are very rarely told.12. I wish we five, who now love one another in our Lord, hadmade some such arrangement as this: as others in these times havemet together in secret [9] to plot wickedness and heresiesagainst His Majesty, so we might contrive to meet together nowand then, in order to undeceive one another, to tell each otherwherein we might improve ourselves, and be more pleasing untoGod; for there is no one that knows himself as well as he isknown of others who see him, if it be with eyes of love and thewish to do him good. I say; in secret; for language of this kindis no longer in use; even preachers go about arranging theirsermons so as to displease no one. [10]  They have a goodintention, and their work is good; yet still few amend theirlives.  But how is it that they are not many who, in consequenceof these sermons, abstain from public sins?  Well, I think it isbecause the preachers are highly sensible men.  They are notburning with the great fire of the love of God, as the Apostleswere, casting worldly prudence aside; and so their fire throwsout but little heat.  I do not say that their fire ought to burnlike that of the Apostles, but I do wish it were a stronger firethan I see it is.  Do you, my father, know wherein much of thisfire consists?  In the hatred of this life, in the desertion ofits honours, in being utterly indifferent whether we lose or gainanything or everything, provided the truth be told and maintainedfor the glory of God; for he who is courageously in earnest forGod, looks upon loss or gain indifferently.  I do not say that Iam a person of this kind, but I wish I was.13. Oh, grand freedom, to regard it as a captivity to be obligedto live and converse with men according to the laws of the world!It is the gift of our Lord; there is not a slave who would notimperil everything that he might escape and return to hiscountry; and as this is the true road, there is no reason why weshould linger; for we shall never effectually gain a treasure sogreat, so long as this life is not ended.  May our Lord give usHis grace for that end!  You, my father, if it shall seem good toyou, will tear up what I have written, and consider it as aletter for yourself alone, and forgive me that I have beenvery bold.1. 'The third degree, or third water, of the Saint, must begin, Ithink, with the prayer of infused recollection, include that ofinfused quiet, and end in that of inebriation; because it is notin our power to draw this water--all we can do is to direct thestream.' (Francis. de St. Thoma, Medulla Mystica,tr. iv. ch. xii. p. 208).2. See St. John of the Cross, Spirit. Canticle, stanzaxvii. vol. ii. p. 98, Engl. trans.3.

ISFJ	 XVII.The Third State of Prayer.  The Effects Thereof.  The HindranceCaused by the Imagination and the Memory.1. Enough has been said of this manner of prayer, and of what thesoul has to do, or rather, to speak more correctly, of what Godis doing within it; for it is He who now takes upon Himself thegardener's work, and who will have the soul take its ease; exceptthat the will is consenting to the graces, the fruition of whichit has, and that it must resign itself to all that the TrueWisdom would accomplish in it--for which it is certain it hasneed of courage; because the joy is so great, that the soul seemsnow and then to be on the very point of going forth out of thebody: and what a blessed death that would be!  Now, I think it isfor the soul's good--as you, my father, have been told--toabandon itself into the arms of God altogether; if He will takeit to heaven, let it go; if to hell, no matter, as it is goingthither with its sovereign Good.  If life is to come to an endfor ever, so it wills; if it is to last a thousand years, itwills that also: His Majesty may do with it as with His ownproperty,--the soul no longer belongs to itself, it has beengiven wholly to our Lord; let it cast all care utterly away.2. My meaning is that, in a state of prayer, so high as this, thesoul understands that God is doing His work without any fatiguingof the understanding, except that, as it seems to me, it is as ifamazed in beholding our Lord taking upon Himself the work of thegood gardener, refusing to let the soul undergo any labourwhatever, but that of taking its pleasure in the flowersbeginning to send forth their fragrance; for when God raises asoul up to this state, it can do all this, and much more,--forthese are the effects of it.3. In one of these visits, how brief soever it may be, theGardener, being who He is,--in a word, the Creator of thewater,--pours the water without stint; and what the poor soul,with the labour, perhaps, of twenty years in fatiguing theunderstanding, could not bring about, that the heavenly Gardeneraccomplishes in an instant, causing the fruit both to grow andripen; so that the soul, such being the will of our Lord, mayderive its sustenance from its garden.  But He allows it not todivide the fruit with others, until by eating thereof, it isstrong enough not to waste it in the mere tasting of it,--givingto Him none of the produce, nor making any compensation for it toHim who supplies it,--lest it should be maintaining others,feeding them at its own cost, and itself perhaps dying ofhunger. [1]  The meaning of this is perfectly clear for those whohave understanding enough to apply it--much more clear than I canmake it; and I am tired.4. Finally, the virtues are now stronger than they were duringthe preceding prayer of quiet; for the soul sees itself to beother than it was, and it knows not how it is beginning to dogreat things in the odour which the flowers send forth; it beingour Lord's will that the flowers should open, in order that thesoul may believe itself to be in possession of virtue; though itsees most clearly that it cannot, and never could, acquire themin many years, and that the heavenly Gardener has given them toit in that instant.  Now, too, the humility of the soul is muchgreater and deeper than it was before; because it sees moreclearly that it did neither much nor little, beyond giving itsconsent that our Lord might work those graces in it, and thenaccepting them willingly.5. This state of prayer seems to me to be a most distinct unionof the whole soul with God, but for this, that His Majestyappears to give the faculties leave to be intent upon, and havethe fruition of, the great work He is doing then.  It happens attimes, and indeed very often, that, the will being in union, thesoul should be aware of it, and see that the will is a captiveand in joy, that the will alone is abiding in greatpeace,--while, on the other hand, the understanding and thememory are so free, that they can be employed in affairs and beoccupied in works of charity.  I say this, that you, my father,may see it is so, and understand the matter when it shall happento yourself; at least, it carried me out of myself, and that isthe reason why I speak of it here.6. It differs from the prayer of quiet, of which I havespoken, [2] though it does seem as if it were all one with it.In that prayer, the soul, which would willingly neither stir normove, is delighting in the holy repose of Mary; but in thisprayer it can be like Martha also. [3]  Accordingly, the soul is,as it were, living the active and contemplative life at once, andis able to apply itself to works of charity and the affairs ofits state, and to spiritual reading.  Still, those who arrive atthis state, are not wholly masters of themselves, and are wellaware that the better part of the soul is elsewhere.  It is as ifwe were speaking to one person, and another speaking to us at thesame time, while we ourselves are not perfectly attentive eitherto the one or the other.  It is a state that is most easilyascertained, and one, when attained to, that ministers great joyand contentment, and that prepares the soul in the highestdegree, by observing times of solitude, or of freedom frombusiness, for the attainment of the most tranquil quietude.It is like the life of a man who is full, requiring no food, withhis appetite satisfied, so that he will not eat of everything setbefore him, yet not so full either as to refuse to eat if he sawany desirable food.  So the soul has no satisfaction in theworld, and seeks no pleasure in it then; because it has in itselfthat which gives it a greater satisfaction, greater joys in God,longings for the satisfaction of its longing to have a deeper joyin being with Him--this is what the soul seeks.7. There is another kind of union, which, though not a perfectunion, is yet more so than the one of which I have just spoken;but not so much so as this spoken of as the third water. You, myfather, will be delighted greatly if our Lord should bestow themall upon you, if you have them not already, to find an account ofthe matter in writing, and to understand it; for it is one gracethat our Lord gives grace; and it is another grace to understandwhat grace and what gift it is; and it is another and furthergrace to have the power to describe and explain it to others.Though it does not seem that more than the first of these--thegiving of the grace--is necessary to enable the soul to advancewithout confusion and fear, and to walk with the greater couragein the way of our Lord, trampling under foot all the things ofthis world, it is a great advantage and a great grace tounderstand it; for every one who has it has great reason topraise our Lord; and so, also, has he who has it not: because HisMajesty has bestowed it upon some person living who is to make usprofit by it.8. This union, of which I would now speak, frequently occurs,particularly to myself.  God has very often bestowed such a graceupon me, whereby He constrains the will, and even theunderstanding, as it seems to me, seeing that it makes noreflections, but is occupied in the fruition of God: like aperson who looks on, and sees so many things, that he knows notwhere to look--one object puts another out of sight, and none ofthem leaves any impression behind.9. The memory remains free, and it must be so, together with theimagination; and so, when it finds itself alone, it is marvellousto behold what war it makes on the soul, and how it labours tothrow everything into disorder.  As for me, I am wearied by it,and I hate it; and very often do I implore our Lord to deprive meof it on these occasions, if I am to be so much troubled by it.Now and then, I say to Him: O my God, when shall my soul praiseThee without distraction, not dissipated in this way, unable tocontrol itself!  I understand now the mischief that sin has done,in that it has rendered us unable to do what we desire--to bealways occupied in God. [4]10. I say that it happens to me from time to time,--it has doneso this very day, and so I remember it well,--to see my soul tearitself, in order to find itself there where the greater part ofit is, and to see, at the same time, that it is impossible:because the memory and the imagination assail it with such force,that it cannot prevail against them; yet, as the other facultiesgive them no assistance, they are not able to do it anyharm--none whatever; they do enough when they trouble its rest.When I say they do no harm, my meaning is, that they cannotreally hurt it, because they have not strength enough, andbecause they are too discursive.  As the understanding gives nohelp, neither much nor little, in the matters put before thesoul, they never rest anywhere, but hurry to and fro, likenothing else but gnats at night, troublesome and unquiet: and sothey go about from one subject to another.11. This comparison seems to me to be singularly to the purpose;for the memory and the imagination, though they have no power todo any harm, are very troublesome.  I know of no remedy for it;and, hitherto, God has told me of none.  If He had, most gladlywould I make use of it; for I am, as I say, tormented very often.This shows our wretchedness and brings out most distinctly thegreat power of God, seeing that the faculty which is free hurtsand wearies us so much; while the others, occupied with HisMajesty, give us rest.12. The only remedy I have found, after many years of weariness,is that I spoke of when I was describing the prayer of quiet: [5]to make no more account of it than of a madman, but let it gowith its subject; for God alone can take it from it,--in short,it is a slave here.  We must bear patiently with it, as Jacobbore with Lia; for our Lord showeth us mercy enough when we areallowed to have Rachel with us.13. I say that it remains a slave; for, after all, let it do whatit will, it cannot drag the other faculties in its train; on thecontrary, they, without taking any trouble, compel it to followafter them.  Sometimes God is pleased to take pity on it, when Hesees it so lost and so unquiet, through the longing it has to beunited with the other faculties, and His Majesty consents to itsburning itself in the flame of that divine candle by which theothers are already reduced to ashes, and their nature lost,being, as it were, supernaturally in the fruition of blessingsso great.14. In all these states of prayer of which I have spoken, whileexplaining this last method of drawing the water out of the well,so great is the bliss and repose of the soul, that even the bodymost distinctly shares in its joy and delight,--and this is mostplain; and the virtues continue to grow, as I said before. [6]It seems to have been the good pleasure of our Lord to explainthese states of prayer, wherein the soul finds itself, with theutmost clearness possible, I think, here on earth.15. Do you, my father, discuss it with any spiritual person whohas arrived at this state, and is learned. If  he says of it, itis well, you may believe that God has spoken it, and you willgive thanks to His Majesty; for, as I said just now, [7] in thecourse of time you will rejoice greatly in that you haveunderstood it.  Meanwhile, if He does not allow you to understandwhat it is, though He does give you the possession of it, yet,with your intellect and learning, seeing that His Majesty hasgiven you the first, you will know what it is, by the help ofwhat I have written here.  Unto Him be praise for ever andever!  Amen.1. See ch. xix. § 4.2. Ch. xv. § 1.3. See Relation, viii. § 6; and Way of Perfection, ch. liii., butch xxxi. of former editions.

ISFJ	 XVIII.The Fourth State of Prayer.  The Great Dignity of the Soul Raisedto It by Our Lord.  Attainable on Earth, Not by Our Merit, but bythe Goodness of Our Lord.1. May our Lord teach me words whereby I may in some measuredescribe the fourth water. [1]  I have great need of Hishelp--even more than I had while speaking of the last; for inthat the soul still feels that it is not dead altogether.  We maythus speak, seeing that to the world it is really dead.  But, asI have said, [2] it retains the sense to see that it is in theworld, and to feel its own loneliness; and it makes use of thatwhich is outward for the purpose of manifesting its feelings, atleast by signs.  In the whole of the prayer already spoken of,and in all the states of it, the gardener undergoes some labour:though in the later states the labour is attended with so muchbliss and comfort of the soul, that the soul would neverwillingly pass out of it,--and thus the labour is not felt aslabour, but as bliss.2. In this the fourth state there is no sense of anything, onlyfruition, without understanding what that is the fruition ofwhich is granted.  It is understood that the fruition is of acertain good containing in itself all good together at once; butthis good is not comprehended.  The senses are all occupied inthis fruition in such a way that not one of them is at liberty,so as to be able to attend to anything else, whether outwardor inward.3. The senses were permitted before, as I have said, [3] to givesome signs of the great joy they feel; but now, in this state,the joy of the soul is incomparably greater, and the power ofshowing it is still less; for there is no power in the body, andthe soul has none, whereby this fruition can be made known.Everything of that kind would be a great hindrance, a torment,and a disturbance of its rest.  And I say, if it really be aunion of all the faculties, that the soul, even if it wished,--Imean, when it is in union,--cannot make it known; and if it can,then it is not union at all.4. How this, which we call union, is effected, and what it is, Icannot tell.  Mystical theology explains it, and I do not knowthe terms of that science; nor can I understand what the mind is,nor how it differs from the soul or the spirit either: all threeseem to me but one; though I do know that the soul sometimesleaps forth out of itself, like a fire that is burning and isbecome a flame; and occasionally this fire increasesviolently--the flame ascends high above the fire; but it is nottherefore a different thing: it is still the same flame of thesame fire.  Your learning, my fathers, will enable you tounderstand the matter; I can go no further.5. What I undertake to explain is that which the soul feels whenit is in the divine union.  It is plain enough what union is--twodistinct things becoming one.  O my Lord, how good Thou art!Blessed be Thou for ever, O my God!  Let all creatures praiseThee, Who hast so loved us that we can truly speak of thiscommunication which Thou hast with souls in this our exile!Yea, even if they be good souls, it is on Thy part greatmunificence and magnanimity,--in a word, it is Thy munificence, Omy Lord, seeing that Thou givest like Thyself.  O infiniteMunificence!--how magnificent are Thy works!  Even he whoseunderstanding is not occupied with the things of earth is amazedthat he is unable to understand these truths.  Why, then, givegraces so high to souls who have been such great sinners?Truly, this passeth my understanding; and when I come to think ofit, I can get no further.  Is there any way at all for me to goon which is not a going back?  For, as to giving Thee thanks formercies so great, I know not how to do it.  Sometimes I relievemyself by giving utterance to follies.  It often happens to me,either when I receive these graces, or when God is about tobestow them,--for, in the midst of them, I have already said, [4]I was able to do nothing,--that I would break out into wordslike these.6. O Lord, consider what Thou art doing; forget not so soon thegreat evils that I have done.  To forgive me, Thou must alreadyhave forgotten them; yet, in order that there may be some limitto Thy graces, I beseech Thee remember them.  O my Creator, pournot a liquor so precious into a vessel so broken; for Thou hastalready seen how on other occasions I allowed it to run waste.Lay not up treasure like this, where the longing after theconsolations of this life is not so mortified as it ought to be;for it will be utterly lost.  How canst Thou commit the defenceof the city, and the keys of its fortress to a commander socowardly, who at the first assault will let the enemy enterwithin?  Oh, let not Thy love be so great, O King Eternal, as toimperil jewels so precious!  O my Lord, to me it seems that itbecomes a ground for undervaluing them, when Thou puttest them inthe power of one so wretched, so vile, so frail, so miserable,and so worthless as I am, who, though she may labour not to losethem, by the help of Thy grace,--and I have need of no littlegrace for that end, being what I am,--is not able to win over anyone to Thee,--in short, I am a woman, not good, but wicked.It seems to me that the talents are not only hidden, but buried,when they are committed to earth so vile.  It is not Thy wont, OLord, to bestow graces and mercies like these upon a soul, unlessit be that it may edify many.7. Thou, O my God, knowest already that I beg this of Thee withmy whole will, from the bottom of my heart, and that I have doneso more than once, and I account it a blessing to lose thegreatest blessings which may be had on earth, if Thou wouldst butbestow these graces upon him who will make a better use of themto the increase of Thy glory.  These, and expressions like these,it has happened to me often to utter.  I saw afterwards my ownfoolishness and want of humility; for our Lord knoweth well whatis expedient, and that there is no strength in my soul to besaved, if His Majesty did not give it with graces so great.8. I purpose also to speak of the graces and effects which abidein the soul, and of that which the soul itself can do, or rather,if it can do anything of itself towards attaining to a state sohigh.  The elevation of the spirit, or union, comes together withheavenly love but, as I understand it, union is a different thingfrom elevation in union itself.  To him who may not have had anyexperience of the latter, it must seem that it is not; and,according to my view of it, even if they are both one, theoperations of our Lord therein are different: there is a growthof the soul's detachment from creatures more abundantly still inthe flight of the spirit. [5]  I have clearly seen that this is aparticular grace, though, as I say, it may be the same, or seemto be so, with the other; but a little fire, also, is as muchfire as a great fire--and yet there is a visible differencebetween them.  Before a small piece of iron is made red-hot in alittle fire, some time must pass; but if the fire be great, theiron very quickly, though bulky, loses its nature altogetherin appearance.9. So, it seems to me, is it with these two kinds of graces whichour Lord bestows.  He who has had raptures will, I am sure,understand it well; to him who has not had that experience, itmust appear folly.  And, indeed, it may well be so; for if aperson like myself should speak of a matter of this kind, andgive any explanation at all of that for the description of whichno words ever can possibly be found, it is not to be wondered atthat I may be speaking foolishly.10. But I have this confidence in our Lord, that He will help mehere; for His Majesty knoweth that my object in writing--thefirst is to obey--is to inspire souls with a longing after sohigh a good.  I will speak of nothing that I do not know by greatexperience: and so, when I began to describe the last kind ofwater, I thought it more impossible for me to speak of it at allthan to speak Greek.  It is a very difficult matter; so I leftit, and went to Communion.  Blessed be our Lord, who is mercifulto the ignorant!  Oh, virtue of obedience! it can do everything!God enlightened my understanding--at one time suggesting thewords, at another showing me how to use them; for, as in thepreceding state of prayer, so also now, His Majesty seems toutter what I can neither speak nor understand. [6]11. What I am saying is the simple truth; and therefore whateveris good herein is His teaching; what is erroneous, clearly comesout of that sea of evil--myself.  If there be any--and there mustbe many--who, having attained to these states of prayer whereuntoour Lord in His mercy has brought me--wretch that I am!--and who,thinking they have missed their way, desire to treat of thesematters with me, I am sure that our Lord will help His servant todeclare the truth more plainly.12. I am now speaking of the water which cometh down from heavento fill and saturate in its abundance the whole of this gardenwith water.  If our Lord never ceased to pour it down whenever itwas necessary, the gardener certainly would have plenty of rest;and if there were no winter, but an ever temperate season, fruitsand flowers would never fail.  The gardener would have hisdelight therein; but in this life that is impossible.  We mustalways be careful, when one water fails, to obtain another.This water from heaven comes down very often when the gardenerleast expects it.13. The truth is that, in the beginning, this almost alwayshappens after much mental prayer.  Our Lord advances step by stepto lay hold of the little bird, and to lay it in the nest whereit may repose.  He observed it fluttering for a long time,striving with the understanding and the will, and with all itsmight, to seek God and to please Him; so now it is His pleasureto reward it even in this life.  And what a reward!--one momentis enough to repay all the possible trials of this life.14. The soul, while thus seeking after God, is conscious, with ajoy excessive and sweet, that it is, as it were, utterly faintingaway in a kind of trance: breathing, and all the bodily strength,fail it, so that it cannot even move the hands without greatpain; the eyes close involuntarily, and if they are open, theyare as if they saw nothing; nor is reading possible,--the veryletters seem strange, and cannot be distinguished,--the letters,indeed, are visible, but, as the understanding furnishes no help,all reading is impracticable, though seriously attempted.The ear hears; but what is heard is not comprehended.  The sensesare of no use whatever, except to hinder the soul's fruition; andso they rather hurt it.  It is useless to try to speak, becauseit is not possible to conceive a word; nor, if it were conceived,is there strength sufficient to utter it; for all bodily strengthvanishes, and that of the soul increases, to enable it the betterto have the fruition of its joy.  Great and most perceptible,also, is the outward joy now felt.15. This prayer, however long it may last, does no harm--atleast, it has never done any to me; nor do I remember, howeverill I might have been when our Lord had mercy upon me in thisway, that I ever felt the worse for it--on the contrary, I wasalways better afterwards.  But so great a blessing, what harm canit do?  The outward effects are so plain as to leave no doubtpossible that there must have been some great cause, seeing thatit thus robs us of our bodily powers with so much joy, in orderto leave them greater.16. The truth is, it passes away so quickly in the beginning--atleast, so it was with me--that neither by the outward signs, norby the failure of the senses, can it be perceived when it passesso quickly away.  But it is plain, from the overflowing abundanceof grace, that the brightness of the sun which had shone theremust have been great, seeing that it has thus made the soul tomelt away.  And this is to be considered; for, as it seems to me,the period of time, however long it may have been, during whichthe faculties of the soul were entranced, is very short; if halfan hour, that would be a long time.  I do not think that I haveever been so long. [7]  The truth of the matter is this: it isextremely difficult to know how long, because the senses are insuspense; but I think that at any time it cannot be very longbefore some one of the faculties recovers itself.  It is the willthat persists in the work; the other two faculties quickly beginto molest it.  As the will is calm, it entrances them again; theyare quiet for another moment, and then they recover themselvesonce more.17. In this way, some hours may be, and are, passed in prayer;for when the two faculties begin to drink deep, and to perceivethe taste of this divine wine, they give themselves up with greatreadiness, in order to be the more absorbed: they follow thewill, and the three rejoice together.  But this state of completeabsorption, together with the utter rest of the imagination,--forI believe that even the imagination is then wholly atrest,--lasts only for a short time; though the faculties do notso completely recover themselves as not to be for some hoursafterwards as if in disorder: God, from time to time, drawingthem to Himself.18. Let us now come to that which the soul feels interiorly.Let him describe it who knows it; for as it is impossible tounderstand it, much more is it so to describe it.  When Ipurposed to write this, I had just communicated, and had risenfrom the very prayer of which I am speaking.  I am thinking ofwhat the soul was then doing.  Our Lord said to me: It undoesitself utterly, My daughter, in order that it may give itselfmore and more to Me: it is not itself that then lives, it is I.As it cannot comprehend what it understands, it understands bynot understanding. [8]19. He who has had experience of this will understand it in somemeasure, for it cannot be more clearly described, because whatthen takes place is so obscure.  All I am able to say is, thatthe soul is represented as being close to God; and that thereabides a conviction thereof so certain and strong, that it cannotpossibly help believing so.  All the faculties fail now, and aresuspended in such a way that, as I said before, [9] theiroperations cannot be traced.  If the soul is making a meditationon any subject, the memory of it is lost at once, just as if ithad never been thought of.  If it reads, what is read is notremembered nor dwelt upon; neither is it otherwise with vocalprayer.  Accordingly, the restless little butterfly of the memoryhas its wings burnt now, and it cannot fly.  The will must befully occupied in loving, but it understands not how it loves;the understanding, if it understands, does not understand how itunderstands--at least, it can comprehend nothing of that itunderstands: it does not understand, as it seems to me, because,as I said just now, this cannot be understood.  I do notunderstand it at all myself.20. In the beginning, it happened to me that I was ignorant ofone thing--I did not know that God was in all things: [10] andwhen He seemed to me to be so near, I thought it impossible.Not to believe that He was present, was not in my power; for itseemed to me, as it were, evident that I felt there His verypresence.  Some unlearned men used to say to me, that He waspresent only by His grace.  I could not believe that, because, asI am saying, He seemed to me to be present Himself: so I wasdistressed.  A most learned man, of the Order of the gloriousPatriarch St. Dominic, delivered me from this doubt; for he toldme that He was present, and how He communed with us: this was agreat comfort to me.21. It is to be observed and understood that this water fromheaven,--this greatest grace of our Lord--always leaves in thesoul the greatest fruits, as I shall now show.1. See ch. xi. § 11.2.

ISFJ	 XIX.The Effects of This Fourth State of Prayer.  Earnest Exhortationsto Those Who Have Attained to It Not to Go Back, Nor to Ceasefrom Prayer, Even if They Fall.  The Great Calamity ofGoing Back.1. There remains in the soul, when the prayer of union is over,an exceedingly great tenderness; so much so, that it would undoitself--not from pain, but through tears of joy it finds itselfbathed therein, without being aware of it, and it knows not howor when it wept them.  But to behold the violence of the firesubdued by the water, which yet makes it burn the more, gives itgreat delight.  It seems as if I were speaking an unknownlanguage.  So it is, however.2. It has happened to me occasionally, when this prayer was over,to be so beside myself as not to know whether I had beendreaming, or whether the bliss I felt had really been mine; and,on finding myself in a flood of tears--which had painlesslyflowed, with such violence and rapidity that it seemed as if acloud from heaven [1] had shed them--to perceive that it was nodream.  Thus it was with me in the beginning, when it passedquickly away.  The soul remains possessed of so much courage,that if it were now hewn in pieces for God, it would be a greatconsolation to it.  This is the time of resolutions, of heroicdeterminations, of the living energy of good desires, of thebeginning of hatred of the world, and of the most clearperception of its vanity.  The soul makes greater and higherprogress than it ever made before in the previous states ofprayer; and grows in humility more and more, because it seesclearly that neither for obtaining nor for retaining this grace,great beyond all measure, has it ever done, or ever been able todo, anything of itself. It looks upon itself as mostunworthy--for in a room into which the sunlight enters strongly,not a cobweb can be hid; it sees its own misery; self-conceit isso far away, that it seems as if it never could have had any--fornow its own eyes behold how very little it could ever do, orrather, that it never did anything, that it hardly gave even itsown consent, but that it rather seemed as if the doors of thesenses were closed against its will in order that it might havemore abundantly the fruition of our Lord.  It is abiding alonewith Him: what has it to do but to love Him?  It neither sees norhears, unless on compulsion: no thanks to it.  Its past lifestands before it then, together with the great mercy of God, ingreat distinctness; and it is not necessary for it to go forth tohunt with the understanding, because what it has to eat andruminate upon, it sees now ready prepared.  It sees, so far asitself is concerned, that it has deserved hell, and that itspunishment is bliss.  It undoes itself in the praises of God, andI would gladly undo myself now.3. Blessed be Thou, O my Lord, who, out of a pool so filthy as Iam, bringest forth water so clean as to be meet for Thy table!Praised be Thou, O Joy of the Angels, who hast been thus pleasedto exalt so vile a worm!4. The good effects of this prayer abide in the soul for sometime.  Now that it clearly apprehends that the fruit is not itsown, the soul can begin to share it with others, and that withoutany loss to itself.  It begins to show signs of its being a soulthat is guarding the treasures of heaven, and to be desirous ofcommunicating them to others, [2] and to pray to God that itselfmay not be the only soul that is rich in them.  It begins tobenefit its neighbours, as it were, without being aware of it, ordoing anything consciously: its neighbours understand the matter,because the odour of the flowers has grown so strong as to makethem eager to approach them.  They understand that this soul isfull of virtue: they see the fruit, how delicious it is, and theywish to help that soul to eat it.5. If this ground be well dug by troubles, by persecutions,detractions, and infirmities,--they are few who ascend so highwithout this,--if it be well broken up by great detachment fromall self-interest, it will drink in so much water that it canhardly ever be parched again.  But if it be ground which is merewaste, and covered with thorns (as I was when I began); if theoccasions of sin be not avoided; if it be an ungrateful soil,unfitted for so great a grace,--it will be parched up again.If the gardener become careless,--and if our Lord, out of Hismere goodness, will not send down rain upon it,--the garden isruined. Thus has it been with me more than once, so that I amamazed at it; and if I had not found it so by experience, I couldnot have believed it.6. I write this for the comfort of souls which are weak, as I am,that they may never despair, nor cease to trust in the power ofGod; even if they should fall after our Lord has raised them toso high a degree of prayer as this is, they must not bediscouraged, unless they would lose themselves utterly.Tears gain everything, and one drop of water attracts another.7. One of the reasons that move me, who am what I am, underobedience to write this, and give an account of my wretched life,and of the graces our Lord has wrought in me,--though I neverserved Him, but offended Him rather,--is what I have just given:and, certainly, I wish I was a person of great authority, thatpeople might believe what I say.  I pray to our Lord that HisMajesty would be pleased to grant me this grace.  I repeat it,let no one who has begun to give himself to prayer bediscouraged, and say: If I fall into sin, it will be worse for meif I go on now with the practice of prayer.  I think so too, ifhe gives up prayer, and does not correct his evil ways; but if hedoes not give up prayer, let him be assured of this--prayer willbring him to the haven of light.8. In this the devil turned his batteries against me, and Isuffered so much because I thought it showed but little humilityif I persevered in prayer when I was so wicked, that--as I havealready said [3]--I gave it up for a year and a half--at least,for a year, but I do not remember distinctly the other sixmonths.  This could not have been, neither was it, anything elsebut to throw myself down into hell; there was no need of anydevils to drag me thither.  O my God, was there ever blindness sogreat as this?  How well Satan prepares his measures for hispurpose, when he pursues us in this way!  The traitor knows thathe has already lost that soul which perseveres in prayer, andthat every fall which he can bring about helps it, by thegoodness of God, to make greater progress in His service.Satan has some interest in this.9. O my Jesus, what a sight that must be--a soul so highlyexalted falling into sin, and raised up again by Thee; who, inThy mercy, stretchest forth Thine hand to save!  How such a soulconfesses Thy greatness and compassion and its own wretchedness!It really looks on itself as nothingness, and confesses Thypower.  It dares not lift up its eyes; it raises them, indeed,but it is to acknowledge how much it oweth unto Thee.  It becomesdevout to the Queen of Heaven, that she may propitiate Thee; itinvokes the Saints, who fell after Thou hadst called them, forsuccour.  Thou seemest now to be too bountiful in Thy gifts,because it feels itself to be unworthy of the earth it treads on.It has recourse to the Sacraments, to a quickened faith, whichabides in it at the contemplation of the power which Thou hastlodged in them.  It praises Thee because Thou hast left us suchmedicines and ointment for our wounds, which not only heal themon the surface, but remove all traces whatever of them.10. The soul is amazed at it.  Who is there, O Lord of my soul,that is not amazed at compassion so great and mercy sosurpassing, after treason so foul and so hateful?  I know not howit is that my heart does not break when I write this, for I amwicked.  With these scanty tears which I am now weeping, but yetThy gift,--water out of a well, so far as it is mine, soimpure,--I seem to make Thee some recompense for treachery sogreat as mine, in that I was always doing evil, labouring to makevoid the graces Thou hast given me.  Do Thou, O Lord, make mytears available; purify the water which is so muddy; at least,let me not be to others a temptation to rash judgments, as I havebeen to myself, when I used to think such thoughts as these.Why, O Lord, dost Thou pass by most holy persons, who have alwaysserved Thee, and who have been tried; who have been brought up inreligion, and are really religious--not such as I am, having onlythe name--so as to make it plain that they are not recipients ofthose graces which Thou hast bestowed upon me?11. I see clearly now, O Thou my Good, Thou hast kept the rewardto give it them all at once: my weakness has need of thesesuccours.  They, being strong, serve Thee without them, and Thoudealest with them as with a strong race, free from allself-interest.  But yet Thou knowest, O my Lord, that I haveoften cried unto Thee, making excuses for those who murmuredagainst me; for I thought they had reason on their side.  This Idid then when Thou of Thy goodness hadst kept me back fromoffending Thee so much, and when I was departing from everythingwhich I thought displeasing unto Thee.  It was when I did thisthat Thou, O Lord, didst begin to lay open Thy treasures for Thyservant.  It seemed as if Thou wert looking for nothing else butthat I should be willing and ready to receive them; accordingly,Thou didst begin at once, not only to give them, but also to makeothers know that Thou wert giving them.12. When this was known, there began to prevail a good opinion ofher, of whom all had not yet clearly understood how wicked shewas, though much of that wickedness was plain enough. Calumny andpersecution began at once, and, as I think, with good reason; soI looked on none of them as an enemy, but made my supplicationsto Thee, imploring Thee to consider the grounds they had.They said that I wished to be a saint, and that I inventednovelties; but I had not then attained in many things even to theobservance of my rule; nor had I come near those excellent andholy nuns who were in the house,--and I do not believe I evershall, if God of His goodness will not do that for me Himself; onthe contrary, I was there only to do away with what was good, andintroduce customs which were not good; at least, I did what Icould to bring them in, and I was very powerful for evil.Thus it was that they were blameless, when they blamed me.  I donot mean the nuns only, but the others as well: they told metruths; for it was Thy will.13. I was once saying the Office,--I had had this temptation forsome time,--and when I came to these words, 'Justus es, Domine,et rectum judicium tuum,' [4] I began to think what a deep truthit was.  Satan never was strong enough to tempt me in any way todoubt of Thy goodness, or of any article of the faith: on thecontrary, it seems to me that the more these truths were abovenature, the more firmly I held them, and my devotion grew; when Ithought of Thy omnipotence, I accepted all Thy wonderful works,and I say it again, I never had a doubt.  Then, as I was thinkinghow it could be just in Thee to allow so many, who, as I said,are Thy most faithful servants, to remain without thoseconsolations and graces which Thou hast given to me, who am whatI am, Thou, O my Lord, didst answer me: Serve thou Me, and meddlenot with this.14. This was the first word which I ever heard Thee speak to me,and it made me greatly afraid.  But as I shall speakhereafter [5] of this way of hearing, and of other matters, I saynothing here; for to do so would be to digress from my subject,and I have already made digressions enough.  I scarcely know whatI have said, nor can it be otherwise; but you, my father, mustbear with these interruptions; for when I consider what God musthave borne with from me, and when I see the state I am in, it isnot strange that I should wander in what I am saying, and what Ihave still to say.15. May it please our Lord that my wanderings may be of thiskind, and may His Majesty never suffer me to have strength toresist Him even in the least; yea, rather than that, may Hedestroy me this moment.  It is evidence enough of His greatcompassions, that He has forgiven so much ingratitude, not once,but often.  He forgave St. Peter once; but I have been forgivenmany times.  Satan had good reasons for tempting me: I oughtnever to have pretended to a strict friendship with One, myhatred of whom I made so public.  Was there ever blindness sogreat as mine?  Where could I think I should find help but inThee?  What folly to run away from the light, to be for everstumbling!  What a proud humility was that which Satan devisedfor me, when I ceased to lean upon the pillar, and threw thestaff away which supported me, in order that my fall might notbe great! [6]16. I make the sign of the cross this moment.  I do not think Iever escaped so great a danger as this device of Satan, which hewould have imposed upon me in the disguise of humility. [7]He filled me with such thoughts as these: How could I make myprayer, who was so wicked, and yet had received so many mercies?It was enough for me to recite the Office, as all others did; butas I did not that much well, how could I desire to do more?I was not reverential enough, and made too little of the merciesof God.  There was no harm in these thoughts and feelings inthemselves; but to act upon them, that was an exceedingly greatwickedness.  Blessed be Thou, O Lord; for Thou camest to my help.This seems to me to be in principle the temptation of Judas, onlythat Satan did not dare to tempt me so openly.  But he might haveled me by little and little, as he led Judas, to the same pitof destruction.17. Let all those who give themselves to prayer, for the love ofGod, look well to this.  They should know that when I wasneglecting it, my life was much worse than it had ever been; letthem reflect on the excellent help and the pleasant humilitywhich Satan provided for me: it was a grave interior disquietude.But how could my spirit be quiet?  It was going away in itsmisery from its true rest.  I remembered the graces and mercies Ihad received, and felt that the joys of this world wereloathsome.  I am astonished that I was able to bear it.  It musthave been the hope I had; for, as well as I can remember now, itis more than twenty-one years ago.  I do not think I ever gave upmy purpose of resuming my prayer; but I was waiting to be veryfree from sin first.18. Oh, how deluded I was in this expectation!  The devil wouldhave held it out before me till the day of judgment, that hemight then take me with him to hell.  Then, when I applied myselfto prayer and to spiritual reading,--whereby I might perceivethese truths, and the evil nature of the way I was walking in,and was often importunate with our Lord in tears,--I was sowicked, that it availed me nothing; when I gave that up, andwasted my time in amusing myself, in great danger of falling intosin, and with scanty helps,--and I may venture to say no help atall, unless it was a help to my ruin,--what could I expect butthat of which I have spoken?19. I believe that a certain Dominican friar, a most learned man,has greatly merited in the eyes of God; for it was he who rousedme from this slumber.  He made me--I think I said sobefore [8]--go to Communion once a fortnight, and be less givento evil; I began to be converted, though I did not cease tooffend our Lord all at once: however, as I had not lost my way, Iwalked on in it, though slowly, falling and rising again; and hewho does not cease to walk and press onwards, arrives at last,even if late.  To lose one's way is--so it seems to me--nothingelse but the giving up of prayer.  God, of His mercy, keeps usfrom this!20. It is clear from this,--and, for the love of God, consider itwell,--that a soul, though it may receive great graces from Godin prayer, must never rely on itself, because it may fall, norexpose itself in any way whatever to any risks of sin.  Thisshould be well considered because much depends on it; for thedelusion here, wherein Satan is able to entangle us afterwards,though the grace be really from God, lies in the traitor's makinguse of that very grace, so far as he can, for his own purpose,and particularly against persons not grown strong in virtues, whoare neither mortified nor detached; for these are not at presentstrong enough--as I shall explain hereafter [9]--to exposethemselves to dangerous occasions, notwithstanding the nobledesires and resolutions they may have.21. This doctrine is excellent, and not mine, but the teaching ofGod, and accordingly I wish ignorant people like myself knew it;for even if a soul were in this state, it must not rely so muchupon itself as to go forth to the battle, because it will haveenough to do in defending itself.  Defensive armour is thepresent necessity; the soul is not yet strong enough to assailSatan, and to trample him under foot, as those are who are in thestate of which I shall speak further on. [10]22. This is the delusion by which Satan prevails: when a soulsees itself so near unto God, when it sees the difference thereis between the things of heaven and those of earth, and when itsees the love which our Lord bears it, there grows out of thatlove a certain trust and confidence that there is to be nofalling away from that the fruition of which it then possesses.It seems to see the reward distinctly, as if it were impossiblefor it to abandon that which, even in this life, is so deliciousand sweet, for anything so mean and impure as worldly joy.Through this confidence, Satan robs it of that distrust which itought to have in itself; and so, as I have just said, [11] thesoul exposes itself to dangers, and begins, in the fulness of itszeal, to give away without discretion the fruit of its garden,thinking that now it has no reason to be afraid for itself.Yet this does not come out of pride; for the soul clearlyunderstands that of itself it can do no good thing; but ratherout of an excessive confidence in God, without discretion:because the soul does not see itself to be unfledged.  It can goforth out of its nest, and God Himself may take it out, but stillit cannot fly, because the virtues are not strong, and itself hasno experience wherewith to discern the dangers; nor is it awareof the evil which trusting to itself may do it.23. This it was that ruined me.  Now, to understand this, andeverything else in the spiritual life, we have great need of adirector, and of conference with spiritual persons.  I fullybelieve, with respect to that soul which God raises to thisstate, that He will not cease to be gracious to it, nor suffer itto be lost, if it does not utterly forsake His Majesty.  But whenthat soul--as I said--falls, let it look to it again and again,for the love of our Lord, that Satan deceive it not by temptingit to give up prayer, as he tempted me, through that falsehumility of which I have spoken before, [12] and would gladlyspeak of again and again.  Let it rely on the goodness of God,which is greater than all the evil we can do.  When we,acknowledging our own vileness, desire to return into His grace,He remembers our ingratitude no more,--no, not even the graces Hehas given us, for the purpose of chastising us, because of ourmisuse of them; yea, rather, they help to procure our pardon thesooner, as of persons who have been members of His household, andwho, as they say, have eaten of His bread.24. Let them remember His words, and behold what He hath doneunto me, who grew weary of sinning before He grew weary offorgiving.  He is never weary of giving, nor can His compassionbe exhausted.  Let us not grow weary ourselves of receiving.May He be blessed for ever, Amen; and may all created thingspraise Him!1. See ch. xx. § 2.2. See ch. xvii. § 3.3. Ch. vii. § 17, and ch. viii. § 5.4.

ISFJ	 XX.The Difference Between Union and Rapture.  What Rapture Is.The Blessing It Is to the Soul.  The Effects of It.1. I wish I could explain, with the help of God, wherein uniondiffers from rapture, or from transport, or from flight of thespirit, as they speak, or from a trance, which are all one. [1]I mean, that all these are only different names for that one andthe same thing, which is also called ecstasy. [2]  It is moreexcellent than union, the fruits of it are much greater, and itsother operations more manifold; for union is uniform in thebeginning, the middle, and the end, and is so also interiorly.But as raptures have ends of a much higher kind, they produceeffects both within and without. [3]  As our Lord has explainedthe other matters, so also may He explain this; for certainly, ifHe had not shown me in what way and by what means thisexplanation was in some measure possible, I should never havebeen able to do it.2. Consider we now that this last water, of which I am speaking,is so abundant that, were it not that the ground refuses toreceive it, we might suppose that the cloud of His great Majestyis here raining down upon us on earth.  And when we are givingHim thanks for this great mercy, drawing near to Him in earnest,with all our might, then it is our Lord draws up the soul, as theclouds, so to speak, gather the mists from the face of the earth,and carries it away out of itself,--I have heard it said that theclouds, or the sun, draw the mists together, [4]--and as a cloud,rising up to heaven, takes the soul with Him, and begins to showit the treasures of the kingdom which He has prepared for it.I know not whether the comparison be accurate or not; but thefact is, that is the way in which it is brought about.During rapture, the soul does not seem to animate the body, thenatural heat of which is perceptibly lessened; the coldnessincreases, though accompanied with exceeding joyand sweetness. [5]3. A rapture is absolutely irresistible; whilst union, inasmuchas we are then on our own ground, may be hindered, though thatresistance be painful and violent; it is, however, almost alwaysimpossible.  But rapture, for the most part, is irresistible.It comes, in general, as a shock, quick and sharp, before you cancollect your thoughts, or help yourself in any way, and you seeand feel it as a cloud, or a strong eagle rising upwards, andcarrying you away on its wings.4. I repeat it: you feel and see yourself carried away, you knownot whither.  For though we feel how delicious it is, yet theweakness of our nature makes us afraid at first, and we require amuch more resolute and courageous spirit than in the previousstates, in order to risk everything, come what may, and toabandon ourselves into the hands of God, and go willingly whitherwe are carried, seeing that we must be carried away, howeverpainful it may be; and so trying is it, that I would very oftenresist, and exert all my strength, particularly at those timeswhen the rapture was coming on me in public.  I did so, too, veryoften when I was alone, because I was afraid of delusions.Occasionally I was able, by great efforts, to make a slightresistance; but afterwards I was worn out, like a person who hadbeen contending with a strong giant; at other times it wasimpossible to resist at all: my soul was carried away, and almostalways my head with it,--I had no power over it,--and now andthen the whole body as well, so that it was lifted up fromthe ground.5. This has not happened to me often: once, however, it tookplace when we were all together in choir, and I, on my knees, onthe point of communicating.  It was a very sore distress to me;for I thought it a most extraordinary thing, and was afraid itwould occasion much talk; so I commanded the nuns--for ithappened after I was made Prioress--never to speak of it.  But atother times, the moment I felt that our Lord was about to repeatthe act, and once, in particular, during a sermon,--it was thefeast of our house, some great ladies being present,--I threwmyself on the ground; then the nuns came around me to hold me;but still the rapture was observed.6. I made many supplications to our Lord, that He would bepleased to give me no more of those graces which were outwardlyvisible; for I was weary of living under such great restraint,and because His Majesty could not bestow such graces on mewithout their becoming known.  It seems that, of His goodness, Hehas been pleased to hear my prayer; for I have never beenenraptured since.  It is true that it was not long ago. [6]7. It seemed to me, when I tried to make some resistance, as if agreat force beneath my feet lifted me up.  I know of nothing withwhich to compare it; but it was much more violent than the otherspiritual visitations, and I was therefore as one ground topieces; for it is a great struggle, and, in short, of little use,whenever our Lord so wills it.  There is no power againstHis power.8. At other times He is pleased to be satisfied when He makes ussee that He is ready to give us this grace, and that it is not Hethat withholds it.  Then, when we resist it out of humility, Heproduces those very effects which would have resulted if we hadfully consented to it.9. The effects of rapture are great: one is that the mighty powerof our Lord is manifested; and as we are not strong enough, whenHis Majesty wills it, to control either soul or body, so neitherhave we any power over it; but, whether we like it or not, we seethat there is one mightier than we are, that these graces are Hisgifts, and that of ourselves we can do nothing whatever; andhumility is deeply imprinted in us.  And further, I confess thatit threw me into great fear, very great indeed at first; for whenI saw my body thus lifted up from the earth, how could I help it?Though the spirit draws it upwards after itself, and that withgreat sweetness, if unresisted, the senses are not lost; atleast, I was so much myself as to be able to see that I was beinglifted up.  The majesty of Him who can effect this so manifestsitself, that the hairs of my head stand upright, [7] and a greatfear comes upon me of offending God, who is so mighty.  This fearis bound up in exceedingly great love, which is acquired anew,and directed to Him, who, we see, bears so great a love to a wormso vile, and who seems not to be satisfied with attracting thesoul to Himself in so real a way, but who will have the bodyalso, though it be mortal and of earth so foul, such as it isthrough our sins, which are so great.10. Rapture leaves behind a certain strange detachment also,which I shall never be able to describe; I think I can say thatit is in some respects different from--yea, higher than--theother graces, which are simply spiritual; for though these effecta complete detachment in spirit from all things, it seems that inthis of rapture our Lord would have the body itself to bedetached also: and thus a certain singular estrangement from thethings of earth is wrought, which makes life much moredistressing.  Afterwards it causes a pain, which we can neverinflict of ourselves, nor remove when once it has come.11. I should like very much to explain this great pain, and Ibelieve I shall not be able; however, I will say something if Ican.  And it is to be observed that this is my present state, andone to which I have been brought very lately, after all thevisions and revelations of which I shall speak, and after thattime, wherein I gave myself to prayer, in which our Lord gave meso much sweetness and delight. [8]  Even now I have thatsweetness occasionally; but it is the pain of which I speak thatis the most frequent and the most common.  It varies in itsintensity.  I will now speak of it when it is sharpest; for Ishall speak later on [9] of the great shocks I used to feel whenour Lord would throw me into those trances, and which are, in myopinion, as different from this pain as the most corporeal thingis from the most spiritual; and I believe that I am notexaggerating much. For though the soul feels that pain, it is incompany with the body; [10] both soul and body apparently shareit, and it is not attended with that extremity of abandonmentwhich belongs to this.12. As I said before, [11] we have no part in causing this pain;but very often there springs up a desire unexpectedly,--I knownot how it comes,--and because of this desire, which pierces thesoul in a moment, the soul begins to be wearied, so much so thatit rises upwards above itself, and above all created things. Godthen so strips it of everything, that, do what it may, there isnothing on earth that can be its companion.  Neither, indeed,would it wish to have any; it would rather die in thatloneliness.  If people spoke to it, and if itself made everyeffort possible to speak, it would be of little use: the spirit,notwithstanding all it may do, cannot be withdrawn from thatloneliness; and though God seems, as it were, far away from thesoul at that moment, yet He reveals His grandeurs at times in thestrangest way conceivable.  That way is indescribable; I do notthink any one can believe or comprehend it who has not previouslyhad experience of it.  It is a communication made, not toconsole, but to show the reason why the soul must be weary;because it is far away from the Good which in itself comprehendsall good.13. In this communication the desire grows, so also does thebitterness of that loneliness wherein the soul beholds itself,suffering a pain so sharp and piercing that, in that veryloneliness in which it dwells, it may literally say ofitself,--and perhaps the royal prophet said so, being in thatvery loneliness himself, except that our Lord may have granted tohim, being a saint, to feel it more deeply,--'Vigilavi, et factussum sicut passer solitarius in tecto.' [12]  These wordspresented themselves to me in such a way that I thought I sawthem fulfilled in myself.  It was a comfort to know that othershad felt this extreme loneliness; how much greater my comfort,when these persons were such as David was!  The soul is then--soI think--not in itself, but on the house-top, or on the roof,above itself, and above all created things; for it seems to me tohave its dwelling higher than even in the highest part of itself.14. On other occasions, the soul seems to be, as it were, in theutmost extremity of need, asking itself, and saying, 'Where isThy God?' [13]  And it is to be remembered, that I did not knowhow to express in Spanish the meaning of those words.Afterwards, when I understood what it was, I used to consolemyself with the thought, that our Lord, without any effort ofmine, had made me remember them.  At other times, I used torecollect a saying of St. Paul's, to the effect that he wascrucified to the world. [14] I do not mean that this is true ofme: I know it is not; but I think it is the state of theenraptured soul.  No consolation reaches it from heaven, and itis not there itself; it wishes for none from earth, and it is notthere either; but it is, as it were, crucified between heaven andearth, enduring its passion: receiving no succour from either.15. Now, the succour it receives from heaven--which, as I havesaid, [15] is a most marvellous knowledge of God, above all thatwe can desire--brings with it greater pain; for the desire thenso grows, that, in my opinion, its intense painfulness now andthen robs the soul of all sensation; only, it lasts but for ashort time after the senses are suspended.  It seems as if itwere the point of death; only, the agony carries with it so greata joy, that I know of nothing wherewith to compare it.  It is asharp martyrdom, full of sweetness; for if any earthly thing bethen offered to the soul, even though it may be that which ithabitually found most sweet, the soul will have none of it; yea,it seems to throw it away at once.  The soul sees distinctly thatit seeks nothing but God; yet its love dwells not on anyattribute of Him in particular; it seeks Him as He is, and knowsnot what it seeks.  I say that it knows not, because theimagination forms no representation whatever; and, indeed, as Ithink, during much of that time the faculties are at rest.Pain suspends them then, as joy suspends them in union and ina trance.16. O Jesus! oh, that some one would clearly explain this to you,my father, were it only that you may tell me what it means,because this is the habitual state of my soul!  Generally, when Iam not particularly occupied, I fall into these agonies of death,and I tremble when I feel them coming on, because they are notunto death.  But when I am in them, I then wish to spend thereinall the rest of my life, though the pain be so very great, that Ican scarcely endure it.  Sometimes my pulse ceases, as it were,to beat at all,--so the sisters say, who sometimes approach me,and who now understand the matter better,--my bones are racked,and my hands become so rigid, that I cannot always join them.Even on the following day I have a pain in my wrists, and over mywhole body, as if my bones were out of joint. [16]  Well, I thinksometimes, if it continues as at present, that it will end, inthe good pleasure of our Lord, by putting an end to my life; forthe pain seems to me sharp enough to cause death; only, I do notdeserve it.17. All my anxiety at these times is that I should die: I do notthink of purgatory, nor of the great sins I have committed, andby which I have deserved hell.  I forget everything in myeagerness to see God; and this abandonment and loneliness seempreferable to any company in the world.  If anything can be aconsolation in this state, it is to speak to one who has passedthrough this trial, seeing that, though the soul may complain ofit, no one seems disposed to believe in it.18. The soul is tormented also because the pain has increased somuch, that it seeks solitude no longer, as it did before, norcompanionship, unless it be that of those to whom it may make itscomplaint.  It is now like a person, who, having a rope aroundhis neck, and being strangled, tries to breathe. This desire ofcompanionship seems to me to proceed from our weakness; for, aspain brings with it the risk of death,--which it certainly does;for I have been occasionally in danger of death, in my greatsickness and infirmities, as I have said before, [17] and I thinkI may say that this pain is as great as any,--so the desire notto be parted, which possesses soul and body, is that which raisesthe cry for succour in order to breathe, and by speaking of it,by complaining, and distracting itself, causes the soul to seekmeans of living very much against the will of the spirit, or thehigher part of the soul, which would not wish to be deliveredfrom this pain.19. I am not sure that I am correct in what I say, nor do I knowhow to express myself, but to the best of my knowledge it comesto pass in this way.  See, my father, what rest I can have inthis life, now that what I once had in prayer andloneliness--therein our Lord used to comfort me--has become ingeneral a torment of this kind; while, at the same time, it is sofull of sweetness, that the soul, discerning its inestimableworth, prefers it to all those consolations which it formerlyhad.  It seems also to be a safer state, because it is the way ofthe cross; and involves, in my opinion, a joy of exceeding worth,because the state of the body in it is only pain.  It is the soulthat suffers and exults alone in that joy and contentment whichsuffering supplies.20. I know not how this can be, but so it is; it comes from thehand of our Lord, and, as I said before, [18] is not anythingthat I have acquired myself, because it is exceedinglysupernatural, and I think I would not barter it for all thegraces of which I shall speak further on: I do not say for all ofthem together, but for any one of them separately.  And it mustnot be forgotten that, as I have just said, these impetuositiescame upon me after I had received those graces from our Lord [19]which I am speaking of now, and all those described in this book,and it is in this state our Lord keeps me at this moment. [20]21. In the beginning I was afraid--it happens to me to be almostalways so when our Lord leads me by a new way, until His Majestyreassures me as I proceed--and so our Lord bade me not to fear,but to esteem this grace more than all the others He had givenme; for the soul was purified by this pain--burnished, or refinedas gold in the crucible, so that it might be the better enamelledwith His gifts, and the dross burnt away in this life, whichwould have to be burnt away in purgatory.22. I understood perfectly that this pain was a great grace; butI was much more certain of it now and my confessor tells me I didwell.  And though I was afraid, because I was so wicked, I nevercould believe it was anything wrong: on the other hand, theexceeding greatness of the blessing made me afraid, when I calledto mind how little I had deserved it.  Blessed be our Lord, whois so good!  Amen.23. I have, it seems, wandered from my subject; for I began byspeaking of raptures, and that of which I have been speaking iseven more than a rapture, and the effects of it are what I havedescribed.  Now let us return to raptures, and speak of theirordinary characteristics.  I have to say that, when the rapturewas over, my body seemed frequently to be buoyant, as if allweight had departed from it; so much so, that now and then Iscarcely knew that my feet touched the ground.  But during therapture itself the body is very often as if it were dead,perfectly powerless.  It continues in the position it was in whenthe rapture came upon it--if sitting, sitting; if the hands wereopen, or if they were shut, they will remain open or shut. [21]For though the senses fail but rarely, it has happened to meoccasionally to lose them wholly--seldom, however, and then onlyfor a short time.  But in general they are in disorder; andthough they have no power whatever to deal with outward things,there remains the power of hearing and seeing; but it is as ifthe things heard and seen were at a great distance, far away.24. I do not say that the soul sees and hears when the rapture isat the highest,--I mean by at the highest, when the faculties arelost, because profoundly united with God,--for then it neithersees, nor hears, nor perceives, as I believe; but, as I said ofthe previous prayer of union, [22] this utter transformation ofthe soul in God continues only for an instant; yet while itcontinues no faculty of the soul is aware of it, or knows what ispassing there.  Nor can it be understood while we are living onthe earth--at least, God will not have us understand it, becausewe must be incapable of understanding it.  I know itby experience.25. You, my father, will ask me: How comes it, then, that arapture occasionally lasts so many hours?  What has oftenhappened to me is this,--I spoke of it before, when writing ofthe previous state of prayer, [23]--the rapture is notcontinuous, the soul is frequently absorbed, or, to speak morecorrectly, our Lord absorbs it in Himself; and when He has heldit thus for a moment, the will alone remains in union with Him.The movements of the two other faculties seem to me to be likethose of the needle of sun-dials, which is never at rest; yetwhen the Sun of Justice will have it so, He can hold it still.26. This I speak of lasts but a moment; yet, as the impulse andthe upraising of the spirit were vehement, and though the otherfaculties bestir themselves again, the will continues absorbed,and causes this operation in the body, as if it were the absolutemistress; for now that the two other faculties are restless, andattempt to disturb it, it takes care--for if it is to haveenemies, the fewer the better--that the senses also shall nottrouble it: and thus it comes to pass that the senses aresuspended; for so our Lord wills it.  And for the most part theeyes are closed, though we may not wish to close them; and ifoccasionally they remain open, as I said just now, the soulneither discerns nor considers what it sees.27. What the body then can do here is still less in order that,when the faculties come together again, there may not be so muchto do.  Let him, therefore, to whom our Lord has granted thisgrace, be not discouraged when he finds himself in thisstate--the body under constraint for many hours, theunderstanding and the memory occasionally astray.  The truth isthat, in general, they are inebriated with the praises of God, orwith searching to comprehend or understand that which has passedover them.  And yet even for this they are not thoroughly awake,but are rather like one who has slept long, and dreamed, and ishardly yet awake.28. I dwell so long on this point because I know that there arepersons now, even in this place, [24] to whom our Lord isgranting these graces; and if their directors have had noexperience in the matter, they will think, perhaps, that theymust be as dead persons during the trance--and they will think sothe more if they have no learning.  It is piteous to see whatthose confessors who do not understand this make people suffer.I shall speak of it by and by. [25]  Perhaps I do not know what Iam saying.  You, my father, will understand it, if I am at allcorrect; for our Lord has admitted you to the experience of it:yet, because that experience is not very great, it may be,perhaps, that you have not considered the matter so much as Ihave done.29. So then, though I do all I can, my body has no strength tomove for some time; the soul took it all away.  Very often, too,he who was before sickly and full of pain remains healthy, andeven stronger; for it is something great that is given to thesoul in rapture; and sometimes, as I have said already, [26] ourLord will have the body rejoice, because it is obedient in thatwhich the soul requires of it.  When we recover ourconsciousness, the faculties may remain, if the rapture has beendeep, for a day or two, and even for three days, so absorbed, oras if stunned,--so much so, as to be in appearance nolonger themselves.30. Here comes the pain of returning to this life; here it is thewings of the soul grew, to enable it to fly so high: the weakfeathers are fallen off.  Now the standard of Christ is raised upaloft, which seems to be nothing else but the going up, or thecarrying up, of the Captain of the fort to the highest tower ofit, there to raise up the standard of God.  The soul, as in aplace of safety, looks down on those below; it fears no dangersnow--yea, rather, it courts them, as one assured beforehand ofvictory.  It sees most clearly how lightly are the things of thisworld to be esteemed, and the nothingness thereof. The soul nowseeks not, and possesses not, any other will but that of doingour Lord's will, [27] and so it prays Him to let it be so; itgives to Him the keys of its own will.  Lo, the gardener is nowbecome the commander of a fortress!  The soul will do nothing butthe will of our Lord; it will not act as the owner even ofitself, nor of anything, not even of a single apple in theorchard; only, if there be any good thing in the garden, it is atHis Majesty's disposal; for from henceforth the soul will havenothing of its own,--all it seeks is to do everything for Hisglory, and according to His will.31. This is really the way in which these things come to pass; ifthe raptures be true raptures, the fruits and advantages spokenof abide in the soul; but if they did not, I should have greatdoubts about their being from God--yea, rather, I should beafraid they were those frenzies of which St. Vincent speaks. [28]I have seen it myself, and I know it by experience, that the soulin rapture is mistress of everything, and acquires such freedomin one hour, and even in less, as to be unable to recognizeitself.  It sees distinctly that all this does not belong to it,neither knows it how it came to possess so great a good; but itclearly perceives the very great blessing which every one ofthese raptures always brings.  No one will believe this who hasnot had experience of it, and so they do not believe the poorsoul: they saw it lately so wicked, and now they see it pretendto things of so high an order; for it is not satisfied withserving our Lord in the common way,--it must do so forthwith inthe highest way it can.  They consider this a temptation and afolly; yet they would not be astonished, if they knew that itcomes not from the soul, but from our Lord, to whom it has givenup the keys of its will.32. For my part, I believe that a soul which has reached thisstate neither speaks nor acts of itself, but rather that thesupreme King takes care of all it has to do.  O my God, how clearis the meaning of those words, and what good reason the Psalmisthad, and all the world will ever have, to pray for the wings of adove! [29]  It is plain that this is the flight of the spiritrising upwards above all created things, and chiefly aboveitself: but it is a sweet flight, a delicious flight--a flightwithout noise.33. Oh, what power that soul possesses which our Lord raises tothis state! how it looks down upon everything, entangled bynothing! how ashamed it is of the time when it was entangled! howit is amazed at its own blindness! how it pities those who arestill in darkness, especially if they are men of prayer, and havereceived consolations from God!  It would like to cry out tothem, that they might be made to see the delusions they are in:and, indeed, it does so now and then; and then a thousandpersecutions fall upon it as a shower.  People consider itwanting in humility, and think it means to teach those from whomit should learn, particularly if it be a woman.  Hence itscondemnation; and not without reason; because they know not howstrong the influence is that moves it.  The soul at times cannothelp itself; nor can it refrain from undeceiving those it loves,and whom it longs to see delivered out of the prison of thislife; for that state in which the soul itself had been beforeneither is, nor seems to be, anything else but a prison.34. The soul is weary of the days during which it respectedpoints of honour, and the delusion which led it to believe thatto be honour which the world calls by that name; now it sees itto be the greatest lie, and that we are all walking therein.It understands that true honour is not delusive, but real,esteeming that which is worthy of esteem, and despising thatwhich is despicable; for everything is nothing, and less thannothing, whatever passeth away, and is not pleasing unto God.The soul laughs at itself when it thinks of the time in which itregarded money, and desired to possess it,--though, as to this, Iverily believe that I never had to confess such a fault; it wasfault enough to have regarded money at all.  If I could purchasewith money the blessings which I possess, I should make much ofit; but it is plain that these blessings are gained by abandoningall things.35. What is there that is procurable by this money which wedesire?  Is it anything of worth, and anything lasting?Why, then, do we desire it?  A dismal resting place it provides,which costs so dear!  Very often it obtains for us hell itself,fire everlasting, and torments without end.  Oh, if all men wouldbut regard it as profitless dross, how peaceful the world wouldbe! how free from bargaining!  How friendly all men would be onewith another, if no regard were paid to honour and money!I believe it would be a remedy for everything.36. The soul sees how blind men are to the nature ofpleasure--how by means of it they provide for themselves troubleand disquietude even in this life.  What restlessness! how littlesatisfaction! what labour in vain!  It sees, too, not only thecobwebs that cover it, and its great faults, but also the specksof dirt, however slight they may be; for the sun shines mostclearly; and thus, however much the soul may have laboured at itsown perfection, it sees itself to be very unclean, if the rays ofthe sun fall really upon it.  The soul is like water in a vessel,which appears pellucid when the sun does not shine through it;but if it does, the water then is found to be full of motes.37. This comparison is literally correct.  Before the soul fellinto the trance, it thought itself to be careful about notoffending God, and that it did what it could in proportion to itsstrength; but now that it has attained to this state, in whichthe Sun of Justice shines upon it, and makes it open its eyes, itbeholds so many motes, that it would gladly close them again.It is not so truly the child of the noble eagle, that it can gazeupon the sun; but, for the few instants it can keep them open, itbeholds itself wholly unclean.  It remembers the words: 'Whoshall be just in Thy presence?' [30]  When it looks on thisDivine Sun, the brightness thereof dazzles it,--when it looks onitself, its eyes are blinded by the dust: the little dove isblind.  So it happens very often: the soul is utterly blinded,absorbed, amazed, dizzy at the vision of so much grandeur.38. It is in rapture that true humility is acquired--humilitythat will never say any good of self, nor suffer others to do so.The Lord of the garden, not the soul, distributes the fruitthereof, and so none remains in its hands; all the good it has,it refers to God; if it says anything about itself, it is for Hisglory.  It knows that it possesses nothing here; and even if itwished, it cannot continue ignorant of that.  It sees this, as itwere, with the naked eye; for, whether it will or not, its eyesare shut against the things of this world, and open to seethe truth.1.

Mystic. par. iii. tr. i, disp. iii., art. 3; 'Hæc oratioraptus superior est præcedentibus orationis gradibus, etiamoratione unionis ordinariæ, et habet effectus multoexcellentiores et multas alias operationes.'2. 'She says that rapture is more excellent than union; that is,that the soul in a rapture has a greater fruition of God, andthat God takes it then more into His own hands.  That isevidently so; because in a rapture the soul loses the use of itsexterior and interior faculties.  When she says that union is thebeginning, middle, and end, she means that pure union is almostalways uniform; but that there are degrees in rapture, of whichsome are, as it were, the beginning, some the middle, others theend.

ISFJ	 XXI.Conclusion of the Subject.  Pain of the Awakening.Light Against Delusions.1. To bring this matter to an end, I say that it is not necessaryfor the soul to give its consent here; it is already given: thesoul knows that it has given up its will into His hands, [1] andthat it cannot deceive Him, because He knoweth all things.  It isnot here as it is in the world, where all life is full of deceitand double-dealing.  When you think you have gained one man'sgood will, because of the outward show he makes, you afterwardslearn that all was a lie.  No one can live in the midst of somuch scheming, particularly if there be any interests at stake.2. Blessed, then, is that soul which our Lord draws on to theunderstanding of the truth!  Oh, what a state for kings!How much better it would be for them if they strove for this,rather than for great dominions!  How justice would prevail undertheir rule!  What evils would be prevented, and might have beenprevented already!  Here no man fears to lose life or honour forthe love of God.  What a grand thing this would be to him who ismore bound than those beneath him to regard the honour of ourLord!--for it is kings whom the crowd must follow.  To make onestep in the propagation of the faith, and to give one ray oflight to heretics, I would forfeit a thousand kingdoms.  And withgood reason: for it is another thing altogether to gain a kingdomthat shall never end, because one drop of the water of thatkingdom, if the soul but tastes it, renders the things of thisworld utterly loathsome.3. If, then, the soul should be wholly engulfed, what then?O Lord, if Thou wert to give me the right to publish this abroad,people would not believe me--as they do not believe many who areable to speak of it in a way very different from mine; but Ishould satisfy myself, at least.  I believe I should count mylife as nothing, if I might make others understand but one ofthese truths.  I know not what I shall do afterwards, for Icannot trust myself; though I am what I am, I have a violentdesire, which is wasting me, to say this to those who are inauthority.  And now that I can do no more, I betake myself toThee, O my Lord, to implore a remedy for all.  Thou knowest wellthat I would gladly divest myself of all the graces which Thouhast given me,--provided I remained in a condition never tooffend Thee,--and give them up to those who are kings; for I knowit would then be impossible for them to allow what they allownow, or fail to receive the very greatest blessings.4. O my God, make kings to understand how far their obligationsreach!  Thou hast been pleased to distinguish them on earth insuch a way that--so I have heard--Thou showest signs in theheavens when Thou takest any of them away.  Certainly, when Ithink of this, my devotion is stirred, because Thou wilt havethem learn, O my King, even from this, that they must imitateThee in their lives, seeing that, when they die, signs arevisible in the heavens, as it was when Thou wert dying Thyself.5. I am very bold; if it be wrong, you, my father, will tear thisout: only believe that I should speak much more to the purpose inthe presence of kings,--if I might, or thought they would listento me,--for I recommend them greatly to God, and I wish I mightbe of service to them.  All this makes one risk life; for I longfrequently to lose mine,--and that would be to lose a little forthe chance of gaining much; for surely it is not possible tolive, when we see with our eyes the great delusion wherein we arewalking, and the blindness in which we are living.6. A soul that has attained to this is not limited to the desiresit has to serve God; for His Majesty gives it strength to bringthose desires to good effect.  Nothing can be put before it intowhich it will not throw itself, if only it thinks that God may beserved thereby: and yet it is doing nothing, because, as I saidbefore, [2] it sees clearly that all is nothing, except pleasingGod.  The trial is, that those who are so worthless as I am, haveno trial of the kind.  May it be Thy good pleasure, O my God,that the time may come in which I may be able to pay one farthingat least, of the heavy debt I owe Thee!  Do Thou, O Lord, sodispose matters according to Thy will, that this Thy servant maydo Thee some service.  Other women there have been who did heroicdeeds for Thee; I am good only to talk; and so it has not beenThy pleasure, O my God, that I should do any thing: all ends intalk and desires--that is all my service.  And yet even in this Iam not free, because it is possible I might fail altogether.7. Strengthen Thou my soul, and prepare it, O Good of all good;and, my Jesus, then ordain Thou the means whereby I may dosomething for Thee, so that there may be not even one who canbear to receive so much, and make no payment in return.  Costwhat it may, O Lord, let me not come before Thee with hands soempty, [3] seeing that the reward of every one will be accordingto his works. [4]  Behold my life, behold my good name and mywill; I have given them all to Thee; I am Thine: dispose of meaccording to Thy will.  I see well enough, O Lord, how little Ican do; but now, having drawn near to Thee,--having ascended tothis watchtower, from which the truth may be seen,--and whileThou departest not from me, I can do all things; but if Thoudepartest from me, were it but for a moment, I shall go thitherwhere I was once--that is, to hell. [5]8. Oh, what it is for a soul in this state to have to return tothe commerce of the world, to see and look on the farce of thislife, [6] so ill-ordered; to waste its time in attending to thebody by sleeping and eating! [7]  All is wearisome; it cannot runaway,--it sees itself chained and imprisoned; it feels then mostkeenly the captivity into which the body has brought us, and thewretchedness of this life.  It understands the reason whySt. Paul prayed to God to deliver him from it. [8]  The soulcries with the Apostle, and calls upon God to deliver it, as Isaid on another occasion. [9]  But here it often cries with somuch violence, that it seems as if it would go out of the body insearch of its freedom, now that they do not take it away.  It isas a slave sold into a strange land; and what distresses it mostis, that it cannot find many who make the same complaint and thesame prayer: the desire of life is more common.9. Oh, if we were utterly detached,--if we never placed ourhappiness in anything of this world,--how the pain, caused byliving always away from God, would temper the fear of death withthe desire of enjoying the true life!  Sometimes I consider, if aperson like myself--because our Lord has given this light to me,whose love is so cold, and whose true rest is so uncertain, for Ihave not deserved it by my works--frequently feels her banishmentso much, what the feelings of the Saints must have been.What must St. Paul and the Magdalene, and others like them, havesuffered, in whom the fire of the love of God has grown sostrong?  Their life must have been a continual martyrdom.It seems to me that they who bring me any comfort, and whoseconversation is any relief, are those persons in whom I findthese desires--I mean, desires with acts.  I say with acts, forthere are people who think themselves detached, and who say so ofthemselves,--and it must be so, for their vocation demands it, aswell as the many years that are passed since some of them beganto walk in the way of perfection,--but my soul distinguishesclearly, and afar off, between those who are detached in words,and those who make good those words by deeds.  The littleprogress of the former, and the great progress of the latter,make it plain.  This is a matter which a person of any experiencecan see into most clearly.10. So far, then, of the effects of those raptures which comefrom the Spirit of God.  The truth is, that these are greater orless.  I say less, because in the beginning, though the effectsare wrought, they are not tested by works, and so it cannot beclear that a person has them; and perfection, too, is a thing ofgrowth, and of labouring after freedom from the cobwebs ofmemory; and this requires some time.  Meanwhile, the greater thegrowth of love and humility in the soul, the stronger the perfumeof the flowers of virtues is for itself and for others. The truthis, that our Lord can so work in the soul in an instant duringthese raptures, that but little remains for the soul to do inorder to attain to perfection.  No one, who has not hadexperience of it, will ever be able to believe what our Lord nowbestows on the soul.  No effort of ours--so I think--can everreach so far.11. However, I do not mean to say that those persons who duringmany years make use of the method prescribed by writers onprayer,--who discuss the principles thereof, and the meanswhereby it may be acquired,--will not, by the help of our Lord,attain to perfection and great detachment with much labour; butthey will not attain to it so rapidly as by the way of raptures,in which our Lord works independently of us, draws the soulutterly away from earth, and gives it dominion over all thingshere below, though the merits of that soul may not be greaterthan mine were: I cannot use stronger language, for my merits areas nothing.  Why His Majesty doeth this is, because it is Hispleasure, and He doeth it according to His pleasure; even if thesoul be without the fitting disposition, He disposes it for thereception of that blessing which He is giving to it.  Although itbe most certain that He never fails to comfort those who do well,and strive to be detached, still He does not always give theseeffects because they have deserved them at His hands bycultivating the garden, but because it is His will to show Hisgreatness at times in a soil which is most worthless, as I havejust said, and to prepare it for all good: and all this in such away that it seems as if the soul was now, in a manner, unable togo back and live in sin against God, as it did before.12. The mind is now so inured to the comprehension of that whichis truth indeed, that everything else seems to it to be butchild's play.  It laughs to itself, at times, when it sees gravemen--men given to prayer, men of religion--make much of points ofhonour, which itself is trampling beneath its feet.  They saythat discretion, and the dignity of their callings, require it ofthem as a means to do more good; but that soul knows perfectlywell that they would do more good in one day by preferring thelove of God to this their dignity, than they will do in ten yearsby considering it.13. The life of this soul is a life of trouble: the cross isalways there, but the progress it makes is great.  When those whohave to do with it think it has arrived at the summit ofperfection, within a little while they see it much more advanced;for God is ever giving it grace upon grace.  God is the soul ofthat soul now; it is He who has the charge of it; and so Heenlightens it; for He seems to be watching over it, alwaysattentive to it, that it may not offend Him,--giving it grace,and stirring it up in His service.  When my soul reached thisstate, in which God showed me mercy so great, my wretchednesscame to an end, and our Lord gave me strength to rise above it.The former occasions of sin, as well as the persons with whom Iwas accustomed to distract myself, did me no more harm than ifthey had never existed; on the contrary, that which ordinarilydid me harm, helped me on.  Everything contributed to make meknow God more, and to love Him; to make me see how much I owedHim, as well as to be sorry for being what I had been.14. I saw clearly that this did not come from myself, that I hadnot brought it about by any efforts of my own, and that there wasnot time enough for it.  His Majesty, of His mere goodness, hadgiven me strength for it.  From the time our Lord began to giveme the grace of raptures, until now, this strength has gone onincreasing.  He, of His goodness, hath held me by the hand, thatI might not go back.  I do not think that I am doing anythingmyself--certainly I do not; for I see distinctly that all this isthe work of our Lord.  For this reason, it seems to me that thesoul in which our Lord worketh these graces,--if it walks inhumility and fear, always acknowledging the work of our Lord, andthat we ourselves can do, as it were, nothing,--may be thrownamong any companions, and, however distracted and wicked thesemay be, will neither be hurt nor disturbed in any way; on thecontrary, as I have just said, that will help it on, and be ameans unto it whereby it may derive much greater profit.15. Those souls are strong which are chosen by our Lord to dogood to others; still, this their strength is not their own.When our Lord brings a soul on to this state, He communicates toit of His greatest secrets by degrees.  True revelations--thegreat gifts and visions--come by ecstasies, all tending to makethe soul humble and strong, to make it despise the things of thisworld, and have a clearer knowledge of the greatness of thereward which our Lord has prepared for those who serve Him. [10]16. May it please His Majesty that the great munificence withwhich He hath dealt with me, miserable sinner that I am, may havesome weight with those who shall read this, so that they may bestrong and courageous enough to give up everything utterly forGod.  If His Majesty repays us so abundantly, that even in thislife the reward and gain of those who serve Him become visible,what will it be in the next?1. Ch. xx. § 30.2. Ch. xx. § 34.3.

ISFJ	 XXII.The Security of Contemplatives Lies in Their Not Ascending toHigh Things if Our Lord Does Not Raise Them.  The Sacred HumanityMust Be the Road to the Highest Contemplation.  A Delusion inWhich the Saint Was Once Entangled.1. There is one thing I should like to say--I think it important:and if you, my father, approve, it will serve for a lesson thatpossibly may be necessary; for in some books on prayer thewriters say that the soul, though it cannot in its own strengthattain to this state,--because it is altogether a supernaturalwork wrought in it by our Lord,--may nevertheless succeed, bylifting up the spirit above all created things, and raising itupwards in humility, after some years spent in a purgative life,and advancing in the illuminative.  I do not very well know whatthey mean by illuminative: I understand it to mean the life ofthose who are making progress.  And they advise us much towithdraw from all bodily imagination, and draw near to thecontemplation of the Divinity; for they say that those who haveadvanced so far would be embarrassed or hindered in their way tothe highest contemplation, if they regarded even the SacredHumanity itself. [1]  They defend their opinion [2] by bringingforward the words [3] of our Lord to the Apostles, concerning thecoming of the Holy Ghost; I mean that Coming which was after theAscension.  If the Apostles had believed, as they believed afterthe Coming of the Holy Ghost, that He is both God and Man, Hisbodily Presence would, in my opinion, have been no hindrance; forthose words were not said to the Mother of God, though she lovedHim more than all. [4]  They think that, as this work ofcontemplation is wholly spiritual, any bodily object whatever candisturb or hinder it.  They say that the contemplative shouldregard himself as being within a definite space, God everywherearound, and himself absorbed in Him.  This is what we shouldaim at.2. This seems to me right enough now and then; but to withdrawaltogether from Christ, and to compare His divine Body with ourmiseries or with any created thing whatever, is what I cannotendure.  May God help me to explain myself!  I am notcontradicting them on this point, for they are learned andspiritual persons, understanding what they say: God, too, isguiding souls by many ways and methods, as He has guided mine.It is of my own soul that I wish to speak now,--I do notintermeddle with others,--and of the danger I was in because Iwould comply with the directions I was reading.  I can wellbelieve that he who has attained to union, and advances nofurther,--that is, to raptures, visions, and other graces of Godgiven to souls,--will consider that opinion to be best, as I didmyself: and if I had continued in it, I believe I should neverhave reached the state I am in now.  I hold it to be a delusion:still, it may be that it is I who am deluded.  But I will tellyou what happened to me.3. As I had no director, I used to read these books, where, bylittle and little, I thought I might understand something.I found out afterwards that, if our Lord had not shown me theway, I should have learned but little from books; for Iunderstood really nothing till His Majesty made me learn byexperience: neither did I know what I was doing.  So, in thebeginning, when I attained to some degree of supernaturalprayer,--I speak of the prayer of quiet,--I laboured to removefrom myself every thought of bodily objects; but I did not dareto lift up my soul, for that I saw would be presumption in me,who was always so wicked. I thought, however, that I had a senseof the presence of God: this was true, and I contrived to be in astate of recollection before Him.  This method of prayer is fullof sweetness, if God helps us in it, and the joy of it is great.And so, because I was conscious of the profit and delight whichthis way furnished me, no one could have brought me back to thecontemplation of the Sacred Humanity; for that seemed to me to bea real hindrance to prayer.4. O Lord of my soul, and my Good!  Jesus Christ crucified!I never think of this opinion, which I then held, without pain; Ibelieve it was an act of high treason, though done in ignorance.Hitherto, I had been all my life long so devout to the SacredHumanity--for this happened but lately; I mean by lately, that itwas before our Lord gave me the grace of raptures and visions.I did not continue long of this opinion, [5] and so I returned tomy habit of delighting in our Lord, particularly at Communion.I wish I could have His picture and image always before my eyes,since I cannot have Him graven in my soul as deeply as I wish.5. Is it possible, O my Lord, that I could have had the thought,if only for an hour, that Thou couldst be a hindrance to mygreatest good?  Whence are all my blessings? are they not fromThee?  I will not think that I was blamable, for I was very sorryfor it, and it was certainly done in ignorance.  And so itpleased Thee, in Thy goodness, to succour me, by sending me onewho has delivered me from this delusion; and afterwards byshowing Thyself to me so many times, as I shall relatehereafter, [6] that I might clearly perceive how great mydelusion was, and also tell it to many persons; which I havedone, as well as describe it as I am doing now.  I believe myselfthat this is the reason why so many souls, after advancing to theprayer of union, make no further progress, and do not attain tovery great liberty of spirit.6. It seems to me, that there are two considerations on which Imay ground this opinion.  Perhaps I am saying nothing to thepurpose, yet what I say is the result of experience; for my soulwas in a very evil plight, till our Lord enlightened it: all itsjoys were but sips; and when it had come forth therefrom, itnever found itself in that company which afterwards it had intrials and temptations.7. The first consideration is this: there is a little absence ofhumility--so secret and so hidden, that we do not observe it.Who is there so proud and wretched as I, that, even afterlabouring all his life in penances and prayers and persecutions,can possibly imagine himself not to be exceedingly rich, mostabundantly rewarded, when our Lord permits him to stand withSt. John at the foot of the cross?  I know not into whose head itcould have entered to be not satisfied with this, unless it bemine, which has gone wrong in every way where it should have goneright onwards.8. Then, if our constitution--or perhaps sickness--will notpermit us always to think of His Passion, because it is sopainful, who is to hinder us from thinking of Him risen from thegrave, seeing that we have Him so near us in the Sacrament, wherehe is glorified, and where we shall not see Him in His greatweariness--scourged, streaming with blood, faint by the way,persecuted by those to whom He had done good, and not believed inby the Apostles?  Certainly it is not always that one can bear tomeditate on sufferings so great as were those He underwent.Behold Him here, before His ascension into heaven, without pain,all-glorious, giving strength to some and courage to others.In the most Holy Sacrament, He is our companion, as if it was notin His power to withdraw Himself for a moment from us.  And yetit was in my power to withdraw from Thee, O my Lord, that I mightserve Thee better!  It may be that I knew Thee not when I sinnedagainst Thee; but how could I, having once known Thee, ever thinkI should gain more in this way?  O Lord, what an evil way I took!and I was going out of the way, if Thou hadst not brought me backto it.  When I see Thee near me, I see all good things together.No trial befalls me that is not easy to bear, when I think ofThee standing before those who judged Thee.9. With so good a Friend and Captain ever present, Himself thefirst to suffer, everything can be borne.  He helps, Hestrengthens, He never fails, He is the true Friend.  I seeclearly, and since then have always seen, that if we are toplease God, and if He is to give us His great graces, everythingmust pass through the hands of His most Sacred Humanity, in whomHis Majesty said that He is well pleased. [7]  I know this byrepeated experience: our Lord has told it me.  I have seenclearly that this is the door [8] by which we are to enter, if wewould have His supreme Majesty reveal to us His great secrets.10. So, then, I would have your reverence seek no other way, evenif you were arrived at the highest contemplation.  This way issafe.  Our Lord is He by whom all good things come to us; He willteach you.  Consider His life; that is the best example. Whatmore can we want than so good a Friend at our side, who will notforsake us when we are in trouble and distress, as they do whobelong to this world!  Blessed is he who truly loves Him, and whoalways has Him near him!  Let us consider the glorious St. Paul,who seems as if Jesus was never absent from his lips, as if hehad Him deep down in his heart.  After I had heard this of somegreat Saints given to contemplation, I considered the mattercarefully; and I see that they walked in no other way.St. Francis with the stigmata proves it, St. Antony of Padua withthe Infant Jesus; St. Bernard rejoiced in the Sacred Humanity; sodid St. Catherine of Siena, and many others, as your reverenceknows better than I do.11. This withdrawing from bodily objects must no doubt be good,seeing that it is recommended by persons who are so spiritual;but, in my opinion, it ought to be done only when the soul hasmade very great progress; for until then it is clear that theCreator must be sought for through His creatures.  All thisdepends on the grace which our Lord distributes to every soul.I do not intermeddle here.  What I would say is, that the mostSacred Humanity of Christ is not to be counted among the objectsfrom which we have to withdraw.  Let this be clearly understood.I wish I knew how to explain it. [9]12. When God suspends all the powers of the soul,--as we see Hedoes in the states of prayer already described,--it is clearthat, whether we wish it or not, this presence is withdrawn.Be it so, then.  The loss is a blessed one, because it takesplace in order that we may have a deeper fruition of what we seemto have lost; for at that moment the whole soul is occupied inloving Him whom the understanding has toiled to know; and itloves what it has not comprehended, and rejoices in what it couldnot have rejoiced in so well, if it had not lost itself, inorder, as I am saying, to gain itself the more.  But that weshould carefully and laboriously accustom ourselves not to strivewith all our might to have always--and please God it bealways!--the most Sacred Humanity before our eyes,--this, I say,is what seems to me not to be right: it is making the soul, asthey say, to walk in the air; for it has nothing to rest on, howfull soever of God it may think itself to be.13. It is a great matter for us to have our Lord before us as Manwhile we are living and in the flesh.  This is that otherinconvenience which I say must be met with.  The first--I havealready begun to describe it--is a little failure in humility, inthat the soul desires to rise of itself before our Lord raisesit, and is not satisfied with meditation on so excellent asubject,--seeking to be Mary before it has laboured with Martha.If our Lord will have a soul to be Mary, even on the first day,there is nothing to be afraid of; but we must not be self-invitedguests, as I think I said on another occasion. [10]  This littlemote of want of humility, though in appearance a mere nothing,does a great deal of harm to those who wish to advancein contemplation.14. I now come back to the second consideration.  We are notangels, for we have a body; to seek to make ourselves angelswhile we are on the earth, and so much on the earth as I was, isan act of folly.  In general, our thoughts must have something torest on, though the soul may go forth out of itself now and then,or it may be very often so full of God as to be in need of nocreated thing by the help of which it may recollect itself.But this is not so common a case; for when we have many things todo, when we are persecuted and in trouble, when we cannot havemuch rest, and when we have our seasons of dryness, Christ is ourbest Friend; for we regard Him as Man, and behold Him faint andin trouble, and He is our Companion; and when we shall haveaccustomed ourselves in this way, it is very easy to find Himnear us, although there will be occasions from time to time whenwe can do neither the one nor the other.15. For this end, that is useful which I spoke of before: [11] wemust not show ourselves as labouring after spiritualconsolations; come what may, to embrace the cross is the greatthing.  The Lord of all consolation was Himself forsaken: theyleft Him alone in His sorrows.  Do not let us forsake Him; forHis hand will help us to rise more than any efforts we can make;and He will withdraw Himself when He sees it be expedient for us,and when He pleaseth will also draw the soul forth out of itself,as I said before. [12]16. God is greatly pleased when He beholds a soul in its humilitymaking His Son a Mediator between itself and Him, and yet lovingHim so much as to confess its own unworthiness, even when Hewould raise it up to the highest contemplation, and saying withSt. Peter: [13] 'Go Thou away from me, O Lord, for I am a sinfulman.'  I know this by experience: it was thus that God directedmy soul.  Others may walk, as I said before, [14] by another anda shorter road.  What I have understood of the matter is this:that the whole foundation of prayer must be laid in humility, andthat the more a soul humbles itself in prayer, the more God liftsit up.  I do not remember that He ever showed me any of thosemarvellous mercies, of which I shall speak hereafter, [15] at anyother time than when I was as one brought to nothing, [16] byseeing how wicked I was.  Moreover, His Majesty contrived to makeme understand matters that helped me to know myself, but which Icould never have even imagined of myself.17. I believe myself that if a soul makes any efforts of its ownto further itself in the way of the prayer of union, and thoughit may seem to make immediate progress, it will quickly fallback, because the foundations were not duly laid.  I fear, too,that such a soul will never attain to true poverty of spirit,which consists in seeking consolation or sweetness, not inprayer,--the consolations of the earth are alreadyabandoned,--but rather in sorrows, for the love of Him who alwayslived in sorrows Himself; [17] and in being calm in the midst ofsorrows and aridities.  Though the soul may feel it in somemeasure, there is no disquiet, nor any of that pain which somepersons suffer, who, if they are not always labouring with theunderstanding and with a sense of devotion, think everythinglost,--as if their efforts merited so great a blessing!18. I am not saying that men should not seek to be devout, northat they should not stand with great reverence in the presenceof God, but only that they are not to vex themselves if theycannot find even one good thought, as I said in anotherplace; [18] for we are unprofitable servants. [19]  What do wethink we can do?  Our Lord grant that we understand this, andthat we may be those little asses who drive the windlass I spokeof: [20] these, though their eyes are bandaged, and they do notunderstand what they are doing, yet draw up more water than thegardener can draw with all his efforts.  We must walk in libertyon this road, committing ourselves into the hands of God.  If itbe His Majesty's good pleasure to raise us and place us among Hischamberlains and secret councillors, we must go willingly; ifnot, we must serve Him in the lower offices of His house, and notsit down on the upper seats. [21]  As I have sometimes said, [22]God is more careful of us than we are ourselves, and knows whateach one of us is fit for.19. What use is there in governing oneself by oneself, when thewhole will has been given up to God? I think this less endurablenow than in the first state of prayer, and it does much greaterharm; for these blessings are supernatural.  If a man has a badvoice, let him force himself ever so much to sing, he will neverimprove it; but if God gives him a good voice, he has no need totry it twice.  Let us, then, pray Him always to show His mercyupon us, with a submissive spirit, yet trusting in the goodnessof God.  And now that the soul is permitted to sit at the feet ofChrist, let it contrive not to quit its place, but keep itanyhow.  Let it follow the example of the Magdalene; and when itshall be strong enough, God will lead it intothe wilderness. [23]20. You, then, my father, must be content with this until youmeet with some one of more experience and better knowledge than Iam.  If you see people who are beginning to taste of God, do nottrust them if they think that they advance more, and have adeeper fruition of God, when they make efforts of their own.Oh, when God wills it, how He discovers Himself without theselittle efforts of ours!  We may do what we like, but He throwsthe spirit into a trance as easily as a giant takes up a straw;no resistance is possible.  What a thing to believe, that Godwill wait till the toad shall fly of itself, when He has alreadywilled it should do so!  Well, it seems to me still moredifficult and hard for our spirit to rise upwards, if God doesnot raise it, seeing that it is burdened with earth, and hinderedin a thousand ways.  Its willingness to rise is of no service toit; for, though an aptness for flying be more natural to it thanto a toad, yet is it so sunk in the mire as to have lost it byits own fault.21. I come, then, to this conclusion: whenever we think ofChrist, we should remind ourselves of the love that made Himbestow so many graces upon us, and also how great that love iswhich our Lord God has shown us, in giving us such a pledge ofthe love He bears us; for love draws forth love.  And though weare only at the very beginning, and exceedingly wicked, yet letus always labour to keep this in view, and stir ourselves up tolove; for if once our Lord grants us this grace, of having thislove imprinted in our hearts, everything will be easy, and weshall do great things in a very short time, and with very littlelabour.  May His Majesty give us that love,--He knows the greatneed we have of it,--for the sake of that love which He bore us,and of His glorious Son, to whom it cost so much to make it knownto us!  Amen.22. There is one thing I should like to ask you, my father.How is it that, when our Lord begins to bestow upon a soul agrace so great as this of perfect contemplation, it is not, as itought to be, perfect at once?  Certainly, it seems it should beso; for he who receives a grace so great ought never more to seekconsolations on earth.  How is it, I ask, that a soul which hasecstasies and so far is more accustomed to receive graces, shouldyet seem to bring forth fruits still higher and higher,--and themore so, the more it is detached,--when our Lord might havesanctified it at once, the moment He came near it?  How is it, Iask again, that the same Lord brings it to the perfection ofvirtue only in the course of time?  I should be glad to learn thereason, for I know it not.  I do know, however, that in thebeginning, when a trance lasts only the twinkling of an eye, andis almost imperceptible but for the effects it produces, thedegree of strength which God then gives is very different fromthat which He gives when this grace is a trance oflonger duration.23. Very often, when thinking of this, have I imagined the reasonmight be, that the soul does not despise itself all at once, tillour Lord instructs it by degrees, and makes it resolute, andgives it the strength of manhood, so that it may trample utterlyupon everything.  He gave this strength to the Magdalene in amoment.  He gives the same grace to others, according to themeasure of their abandonment of themselves into the hands of HisMajesty, that He may do with them as He will. We never thoroughlybelieve that God rewards a hundredfold even in this life. [24]24. I also thought of this comparison: supposing grace given tothose who are far advanced to be the same with that given tothose who are but beginners, we may then liken it to a certainfood of which many persons partake: they who eat a little retainthe savour of it for a moment, they who eat more are nourished byit, but those who eat much receive life and strength.  Now, thesoul may eat so frequently and so abundantly of this food of lifeas to have no pleasure in eating any other food, because it seeshow much good it derives from it.  Its taste is now so formedupon it, that it would rather not live than have to eat any otherfood; for all food but this has no other effect than to take awaythe sweet savour which this good food leaves behind.25. Further, the conversation of good people does not profit usin one day as much as it does in many; and we may converse withthem long enough to become like them, by the grace of God.In short, the whole matter is as His Majesty wills.  He gives Hisgrace to whom He pleases; but much depends on this: he who beginsto receive this grace must make a firm resolution to detachhimself from all things, and esteem this grace accordingto reason.26. It seems also to me as if His Majesty were going about to trythose who love Him,--now one, now another,--revealing Himself insupreme joy, so as to quicken our belief, if it should be dead,in what He will give us, saying, Behold! this is but a drop ofthe immense sea of blessings; for He leaves nothing undone forthose He loves; and as He sees them receive it, so He gives, andHe gives Himself.  He loves those who love Him.  Oh, how dear Heis!--how good a Friend!  O my soul's Lord, who can find words todescribe what Thou givest to those who trust in Thee, and whatthey lose who come to this state, and yet dwell in themselves!Oh, let not this be so, O my Lord! for Thou doest more than thiswhen Thou comest to a lodging so mean as mine.  Blessed be Thoufor ever and ever!27. I now humbly ask you, my father, if you mean to discuss whatI have written on prayer with spiritual persons, to see that theyare so really; for if they be persons who know only one way, orwho have stood still midway, they will not be able to understandthe matter.  There are also some whom God leads at once by thehighest way; these think that others might advance in the samemanner--quiet the understanding, and make bodily objects none oftheir means; but these people will remain dry as a stick.Others, also, there are who, having for a moment attained to theprayer of quiet, think forthwith that, as they have had the one,so they may have the other.  These instead of advancing, go back,as I said before. [25]  So, throughout, experience and discretionare necessary.  May our Lord, of His goodness, bestow them on us!1.

ISFJ	 XXIII.The Saint Resumes the History of Her Life.  Aiming at Perfection.Means Whereby It May Be Gained.  Instructions for Confessors.1. I shall now return to that point in my life where I brokeoff, [1] having made, I believe, a longer digression than I needhave made, in order that what is still to come may be moreclearly understood.  Henceforth, it is another and a new book,--Imean, another and a new life.  Hitherto, my life was my own; mylife, since I began to explain these methods of prayer, is thelife which God lived in me,--so it seems to me; for I feel it tobe impossible that I should have escaped in so short a time fromways and works that were so wicked.  May our Lord be praised, whohas delivered me from myself!2. When, then, I began to avoid the occasions of sin, and to givemyself more unto prayer, our Lord also began to bestow His gracesupon me, as one who desired, so it seemed, that I too should bewilling to receive them.  His Majesty began to give me mostfrequently the grace of the prayer of quiet, and very often thatof union, which lasted some time.  But as, in these days, womenhave fallen into great delusions and deceits of Satan, [2] Ibegan to be afraid, because the joy and sweetness which I feltwere so great, and very often beyond my power to avoid.  On theother hand, I felt in myself a very deep conviction that God waswith me, especially when I was in prayer.  I saw, too, that Igrew better and stronger thereby.3. But if I was a little distracted, I began to be afraid, and toimagine that perhaps it was Satan that suspended myunderstanding, making me think it to be good, in order towithdraw me from mental prayer, hinder my meditation on thePassion, and debar me the use of my understanding: this seemed tome, who did not comprehend the matter, to be a grievous loss but,as His Majesty was pleased to give me light to offend Him nomore, and to understand how much I owed Him, this fear so grewupon me, that it made me seek diligently for spiritual personswith whom I might treat of my state.  I had already heard ofsome; for the Fathers of the Society of Jesus had comehither; [3] and I, though I knew none of them, was greatlyattracted by them, merely because I had heard of their way oflife and of prayer; but I did not think myself fit to speak tothem, or strong enough to obey them; and this made me still moreafraid; for to converse with them, and remain what I was, seemedto me somewhat rude.4. I spent some time in this state, till, after much inwardcontention and fear, I determined to confer with some spiritualperson, to ask him to tell me what that method of prayer waswhich I was using, and to show me whether I was in error.  I wasalso resolved to do everything I could not to offend God; for thewant of courage of which I was conscious, as I said before, [4]made me so timid.  Was there ever delusion so great as mine, O myGod, when I withdrew from good in order to become good!The devil must lay much stress on this in the beginning of acourse of virtue; for I could not overcome my repugnance.He knows that the whole relief of the soul consists in conferringwith the friends of God.  Hence it was that no time was fixed inwhich I should resolve to do this.  I waited to grow betterfirst, as I did before when I ceased to pray, [5]--and perhaps Inever should have become better; for I had now sunk so deeplyinto the petty ways of an evil habit,--I could not convincemyself that they were wrong,--that I needed the help of others,who should hold out a hand to raise me up.  Blessed be Thou, OLord!--for the first hand outstretched to me was Thine.5. When I saw that my fear was going so far, it struckme--because I was making progress in prayer--that this must be agreat blessing, or a very great evil; for I understood perfectlythat what had happened was something supernatural, because attimes I was unable to withstand it; to have it when I would wasalso impossible.  I thought to myself that there was no help forit, but in keeping my conscience pure, avoiding every occasioneven of venial sins; for if it was the work of the Spirit of God,the gain was clear; and if the work of Satan, so long as I stroveto please, and did not offend, our Lord, Satan could do me littleharm; on the contrary, he must lose in the struggle.Determined on this course, and always praying God to help me,striving also after purity of conscience for some days, I sawthat my soul had not strength to go forth alone to a perfectionso great.  I had certain attachments to trifles, which, thoughnot very wrong in themselves, were yet enough to ruin all.6. I was told of a learned ecclesiastic, [6] dwelling in thiscity, whose goodness and pious life our Lord was beginning tomake known to the world.  I contrived to make his acquaintancethrough a saintly nobleman [7] living in the same place.This latter is a married man; but his life is so edifying andvirtuous, so given to prayer, and so full of charity, that thegoodness and perfection of it shine forth in all he does: andmost justly so; for many souls have been greatly blessed throughhim, because of his great gifts, which, though his condition of alayman be a hindrance to him, never lie idle.  He is a man ofgreat sense, and very gentle with all people; his conversation isnever wearisome, but so sweet and gracious, as well as uprightand holy, that he pleases everybody very much with whom he hasany relations.  He directs it all to the great good of thosesouls with whom he converses and he seems to have no other end inview but to do all he may be permitted to do for all men, andmake them content.7. This blessed and holy man, then, seems to me, by the pains hetook, to have been the beginning of salvation to my soul.His humility in his relations with me makes me wonder; for he hadspent, I believe, nearly forty years in prayer,--it may be two orthree years less,--and all his life was ordered with thatperfection which his state admitted.  His wife is so great aservant of God, and so full of charity, that nothing is lost tohim on her account, [8]--in short, she was the chosen wife of onewho God knew would serve Him so well.  Some of their kindred aremarried to some of mine.  Besides, I had also much communicationwith another great servant of God, married to one of myfirst cousins.8. It was thus I contrived that the ecclesiastic I speak of, whowas so great a servant of God, and his great friend, should cometo speak to me, intending to confess to him, and to take him formy director.  When he had brought him to speak to me, I, in thegreatest confusion at finding myself in the presence of so holy aman, revealed to him the state of my soul, and my way of prayer.He would not be my confessor; he said that he was very muchoccupied: and so, indeed, he was.  He began with a holyresolution to direct me as if I was strong,--I ought to have beenstrong, according to the method of prayer which he saw Iused,--so that I should in nothing offend God.  When I saw thathe was resolved to make me break off at once with the petty waysI spoke of before, [9] and that I had not the courage to go forthat once in the perfection he required of me, I was distressed;and when I perceived that he ordered the affairs of my soul as ifI ought to be perfect at once, I saw that much more care wasnecessary in my case.  In a word, I felt that the means he wouldhave employed were not those by which my soul could be helpedonwards; for they were fitted for a soul more perfect than mine;and though the graces I had received from God were very many, Iwas still at the very beginning in the matter of virtue andof mortification.9. I believe certainly, if I had only had this ecclesiastic toconfer with, that my soul would have made no progress; for thepain it gave me to see that I was not doing--and, as I thought,could not do--what he told me, was enough to destroy all hope,and make me abandon the matter altogether.  I wonder at times howit was that he, being one who had a particular grace for thedirection of beginners in the way of God, was not permitted tounderstand my case, or to undertake the care of my soul.  I seeit was all for my greater good, in order that I might know andconverse with persons so holy as the members of the Societyof Jesus.10. After this, I arranged with that saintly nobleman that heshould come and see me now and then.  It shows how deep hishumility was; for he consented to converse with a person sowicked as I was.  He began his visits, he encouraged me, and toldme that I ought not to suppose I could give up everything in oneday; God would bring it about by degrees: he himself had for someyears been unable to free himself from some very slightimperfections.  O humility! what great blessings thou bringest tothose in whom thou dwellest, and to them who draw near to thosewho possess thee!  This holy man--for I think I may justly callhim so--told me of weaknesses of his own, in order to help me.He, in his humility, thought them weaknesses; but, if we considerhis state, they were neither faults nor imperfections; yet, in mystate, it was a very great fault to be subject to them.11. I am not saying this without a meaning, though I seem to beenlarging on trifles; but these trifles contribute so muchtowards the beginning of the soul's progress and its flightupwards, though it has no wings, as they say; and yet no one willbelieve it who has not had experience of it; but, as I hope inGod that your reverence will help many a soul, I speak of ithere.  My whole salvation depended on his knowing how to treatme, on his humility, on the charity with which he conversed withme, and on his patient endurance of me when he saw that I did notmend my ways at once.  He went on discreetly, by degrees showingme how to overcome Satan.  My affection for him so grew upon me,that I never was more at ease than on the day I used to see him.I saw him, however, very rarely.  When he was long in coming, Iused to be very much distressed, thinking that he would not seeme because I was so wicked.12. When he found out my great imperfections, they might wellhave been sins, though since I conversed with him I am somewhatimproved,--and when I recounted to him, in order to obtain lightfrom him, the great graces which God had bestowed upon me, hetold me that these things were inconsistent one with another;that these consolations were given to people who had made greatprogress, and led mortified lives; that he could not help beingvery much afraid--he thought that the evil spirit might havesomething to do in my case; he would not decide that question,however, but he would have me carefully consider my whole methodof prayer, and then tell him of it.  That was the difficulty: Idid not understand it myself, and so I could tell him nothing ofmy prayer; for the grace to understand it--and, understanding it,to describe it--has only lately been given me of God.This saying of his, together with the fear I was in, distressedme exceedingly, and I cried; for certainly I was anxious toplease God, and I could not persuade myself that Satan hadanything to do with it.  But I was afraid, on account of my greatsins, that God might leave me blind, so that I shouldunderstand nothing.13. Looking into books to see if I could find anything there bywhich I might recognise the prayer I practised, I found in one ofthem, called the Ascent of the Mount, [10] and in that part of itwhich relates to the union of the soul with God, all those markswhich I had in myself, in that I could not think of anything.This is what I most dwelt on--that I could think of nothing whenI was in prayer.  I marked that passage, and gave him the book,that he, and the ecclesiastic mentioned before, [11] saint andservant of God, might consider it, and tell me what I should do.If they thought it right, I would give up that method of prayeraltogether; for why should I expose myself to danger, when, atthe end of nearly twenty years, during which I had used it, I hadgained nothing, but had fallen into a delusion of the devil?It was better for me to give it up.  And yet this seemed to mehard; for I had already discovered what my soul would becomewithout prayer.  Everything seemed full of trouble.  I was like aperson in the middle of a river, who, in whatever direction hemay turn, fears a still greater danger, and is well-nigh drowned.This is a very great trial, and I have gone through many like it,as I shall show hereafter; [12] and though it does not seem to beof any importance, it will perhaps be advantageous to understandhow the spirit is to be tried.14. And certainly the affliction to be borne is great, andcaution is necessary, particularly in the case of women,--for ourweakness is great,--and much evil may be the result of tellingthem very distinctly that the devil is busy with them; yea,rather, the matter should be very carefully considered, and theyshould be removed out of reach of the dangers that may arise.They should be advised to keep things secret; and it isnecessary, also, that their secret should be kept.  I am speakingof this as one to whom it has been a sore trouble; for some ofthose with whom I spoke of my prayer did not keep my secret, but,making inquiries one of another, for a good purpose, did me muchharm; for they made things known which might well have remainedsecret, because not intended for every one and it seemed as if Ihad made them public myself. [13]15. I believe that our Lord permitted [14] this to be donewithout sin on their part, in order that I might suffer.  I donot say that they revealed anything I discussed with them inconfession; still, as they were persons to whom, in my fears, Igave a full account of myself, in order that they might give melight, I thought they ought to have been silent.  Nevertheless, Inever dared to conceal anything from such persons.  My meaning,then, is, that women should be directed with much discretion;their directors should encourage them, and bide the time when ourLord will help them, as He has helped me.  If He had not, thegreatest harm would have befallen me, for I was in great fear anddread; and as I suffered from disease of the heart, [15] I amastonished that all this did not do me a great deal of harm.16. Then, when I had given him the book, and told the story of mylife and of my sins, the best way I could in general,--for I wasnot in confession, because he was a layman; yet I gave himclearly to understand how wicked I was,--those two servants ofGod, with great charity and affection, considered what was bestfor me.  When they had made up their minds what to say,--I waswaiting for it in great dread, having begged many persons to prayto God for me, and I too had prayed much during those days,--thenobleman came to me in great distress, and said that, in theopinion of both, I was deluded by an evil spirit; that the bestthing for me to do was to apply to a certain father of theSociety of Jesus, who would come to me if I sent for him, sayingI had need of him; that I ought, in a general confession, to givehim an account of my whole life, and of the state I was in,--andall with great clearness: God would, in virtue of the Sacramentof Confession, give him more light concerning me; for thosefathers were very experienced men in matters of spirituality.Further, I was not to swerve in a single point from the counselsof that father; for I was in great danger, if I had no one todirect me.17. This answer so alarmed and distressed me, that I knew notwhat to do--I did nothing but cry.  Being in an oratory in greataffliction, not knowing what would become of me, I read in abook--it seemed as if our Lord had put it into my hands--thatSt. Paul said, God is faithful; [16] that He will never permitSatan to deceive those who love Him.  This gave me greatconsolation. I began to prepare for my general confession, and towrite out all the evil and all the good: a history of my life, asclearly as I understood it, and knew how to make it, omittingnothing whatever.  I remember, when I saw I had written so muchevil, and scarcely anything that was good, that I was exceedinglydistressed and sorrowful.  It pained me, also, that the nuns ofthe community should see me converse with such holy persons asthose of the Society of Jesus; for I was afraid of my ownwickedness, and I thought I should be obliged to cease from it,and give up my amusements; and that if I did not do so, I shouldgrow worse: so I persuaded the sacristan and the portress to tellno one of it.  This was of little use, after all; for when I wascalled down there was one at the door, as it happened, who toldit to the whole convent.  But what difficulties and what terrorsSatan troubles them with who would draw near unto God!18. I communicated the whole state of my soul to that servant ofGod [17] and he was a great servant of His, and very prudent.He understood all I told him, explained it to me, and encouragedme greatly.  He said that all was very evidently the work of theSpirit of God; only it was necessary for me to go back again tomy prayer, because I was not well grounded, and had not begun tounderstand what mortification meant,--that was true, for I do notthink I knew it even by name,--that I was by no means to give upprayer; on the contrary, I was to do violence to myself in orderto practise it, because God had bestowed on me such specialgraces as made it impossible to say whether it was, or was not,the will of our Lord to do good to many through me. He wentfurther, for he seems to have prophesied of that which our Lordafterwards did with me, and said that I should be very much toblame if I did not correspond with the graces which God bestowedupon me.  It seems to me that the Holy Ghost was speaking by hismouth in order to heal my soul, so deep was the impression hemade.  He made me very much ashamed of myself, and directed me bya way which seemed to change me altogether.  What a grand thingit is to understand a soul!  He told me to make my prayer everyday on some mystery of the Passion, and that I should profit byit, and to fix my thoughts on the Sacred Humanity only, resistingto the utmost of my power those recollections and delights, towhich I was not to yield in any way till he gave me furtherdirections in the matter.19. He left me consoled and fortified: our Lord came to mysuccour and to his, so that he might understand the state I wasin, and how he was to direct me.  I made a firm resolution not toswerve from anything he might command me, and to this day I havekept it.  Our Lord be praised, who has given me grace to beobedient to my confessors, [18] however imperfectly!--and theyhave almost always been those blessed men of the Society ofJesus; though, as I said, I have but imperfectly obeyed them.My soul began to improve visibly, as I am now going to say.1.

ISFJ	 XXIV.Progress Under Obedience.  Her Inability to Resist the Gracesof God.  God Multiplies His Graces.1. After this my confession, my soul was so docile that, as itseems to me, there was nothing in the world I was not prepared toundertake.  I began at once to make a change in many things,though my confessor never pressed me--on the contrary, he seemedto make light of it all.  I was the more influenced by this,because he led me on by the way of the love of God; he left mefree, and did not press me, unless I did so myself, out of love.I continued thus nearly two months, doing all I could to resistthe sweetness and graces that God sent.  As to my outward life,the change was visible; for our Lord gave me courage to gothrough with certain things, of which those who knew me--and eventhose in the community--said that they seemed to them extreme;and, indeed, compared with what I had been accustomed to do, theywere extreme: people, therefore, had reason to say so.  Yet, inthose things which were of obligation, considering the habit Iwore, and the profession I had made, I was still deficient.By resisting the sweetness and joys which God sent me, I gainedthis, that His Majesty taught me Himself; for, previously, I usedto think that, in order to obtain sweetness in prayer, it wasnecessary for me to hide myself in secret places, and so Iscarcely dared to stir.  Afterwards, I saw how little that was tothe purpose; for the more I tried to distract myself, the moreour Lord poured over me that sweetness and joy which seemed to meto be flowing around me, so that I could not in any way escapefrom it: and so it was.  I was so careful about this resistance,that it was a pain to me.  But our Lord was more careful to showHis mercies, and during those two months to reveal Himself morethan before, so that I might the better comprehend that it was nolonger in my power to resist Him.2. I began with a renewed love of the most Sacred Humanity; myprayer began to be solid, like a house, the foundations of whichare strong; and I was inclined to practise greater penance,having been negligent in this matter hitherto because of my greatinfirmities.  The holy man who heard my confession told me thatcertain penances would not hurt me, and that God perhaps sent meso much sickness because I did no penance; His Majesty wouldtherefore impose it Himself.  He ordered me to practise certainacts of mortification not very pleasant for me. [1] I did so,because I felt that our Lord was enjoining it all, and giving himgrace to command me in such a way as to make me obedientunto him.3. My soul was now sensitive to every offence I committed againstGod, however slight it might be; so much so, that if I had anysuperfluity about me, I could not recollect myself in prayer tillI had got rid of it.  I prayed earnestly that our Lord would holdme by the hand, and not suffer me to fall again, now that I wasunder the direction of His servants.  I thought that would be agreat evil, and that they would lose their credit through me.4. At this time, Father Francis, who was Duke of Gandia, [2] camehere; he had left all he possessed some years before, and hadentered the Society of Jesus.  My confessor, and the nobleman ofwhom I spoke before, [3] contrived that he should visit me, inorder that I might speak to him, and give him an account of myway of prayer; for they knew him to be greatly favoured andcomforted of God: he had given up much, and was rewarded for iteven in this life.  When he had heard me, he said to me that itwas the work of the Spirit of God, [4] and that he thought it wasnot right now to prolong that resistance; that hitherto it hadbeen safe enough,--only, I should always begin my prayer bymeditating on some part of the Passion and that if our Lordshould then raise up my spirit, I should make no resistance, butsuffer His Majesty to raise it upwards, I myself not seeking it.He gave both medicine and advice, as one who had made greatprogress himself; for experience is very important in thesematters.  He said that further resistance would be a mistake.I was exceedingly consoled; so, too, was the nobleman, whorejoiced greatly when he was told that it was the work of God.He always helped me and gave me advice according to hispower,--and that power was great.5. At this time, they changed my confessor's residence.  I feltit very much, for I thought I should go back to my wickedness,and that it was not possible to find another such as he.  My soulwas, as it were, in a desert, most sorrowful and afraid.  I knewnot what to do with myself.  One of my kinswomen contrived to getme into her house, and I contrived at once to find anotherconfessor, [5] in the Society of Jesus.  It pleased our Lord thatI should commence a friendship with a noble lady, [6] a widow,much given to prayer, who had much to do with the fathers.She made her own confessor [7] hear me, and I remained in herhouse some days.  She lived near, and I delighted in the manyconferences I had with the fathers; for merely by observing theholiness of their way of life, I felt that my soulprofited exceedingly.6. This father began by putting me in the way of greaterperfection.  He used to say to me, that I ought to leave nothingundone that I might be wholly pleasing unto God.  He was,however, very prudent and very gentle at the same time; for mysoul was not at all strong, but rather very weak, especially asto giving up certain friendships, though I did not offend God bythem: there was much natural affection in them, and I thought itwould be an act of ingratitude if I broke them off.  And so, as Idid not offend God, I asked him if I must be ungrateful.  He toldme to lay the matter before God for a few days, and recite thehymn, 'Veni, Creator,' that God might enlighten me as to thebetter course.  One day, having prayed for some time, andimplored our Lord to help me to please Him in all things, I beganthe hymn; and as I was saying it, I fell into a trance--sosuddenly, that I was, as it were, carried out of myself.  I couldhave no doubt about it, for it was most plain.7. This was the first time that our Lord bestowed on me the graceof ecstasy.  I heard these words: 'I will not have thee conversewith men, but with angels.'  This made me wonder very much; forthe commotion of my spirit was great, and these words wereuttered in the very depth of my soul.  They made meafraid,--though, on the other hand, they gave me great comfort,which, when I had lost the fear,--caused, I believe, by thestrangeness of the visitation,--remained with me.8. Those words have been fulfilled; for I have never been able toform friendship with, nor have any comfort in, nor any particularlove for, any persons whatever except those who, as I believe,love God, and who strive to serve Him.  It has not been in mypower to do it.  It is nothing to me that they are my kindred, ormy friends, if I do not know them to be lovers of God, or personsgiven to prayer.  It is to me a painful cross to converse withany one.  This is the truth, so far as I can judge. [8]From that day forth, I have had courage so great as to leave allthings for God, who in one moment--and it seems to me but amoment--was pleased to change His servant into another person.Accordingly, there was no necessity for laying further commandsupon me in this matter.  When my confessor saw how much I clungto these friendships, he did not venture to bid me distinctly togive them up.  He must have waited till our Lord did the work--asHe did Himself.  Nor did I think myself that I could succeed; forI had tried before, and the pain it gave me was so great that Iabandoned the attempt, on the ground that there was nothingunseemly in those attachments.  Now our Lord set me at liberty,and gave me strength also to use it.9. So I told my confessor of it, and gave up everything,according to his advice.  It did a great deal of good to thosewith whom I used to converse, to see my determination.  God beblessed for ever! Who in one moment set me free, while I had beenfor many years making many efforts, and had never succeeded, veryoften also doing such violence to myself as injured my health;but, as it was done by Him Who is almighty, and the true Lord ofall, it gave me no pain whatever.1. The Saint now treated her body with extreme severity,disciplining herself even unto blood (Reforma, vol. i. lib. i. c.xx. § 4).2. St. Francis de Borja came to Avila, where St. Teresa lived, in1557 (De la Fuente).  This passage must have been written afterthe foundation of St. Joseph, for it was not in the first Life,as the Saint says, ch. x. § 11, that he kept secret the names ofherself and all others.3. Ch. xxiii. § 6.4. See Relation, viii. § 6.5. Who he was is not certainly known.  The Bollandists decline togive an opinion: but F. Bouix thinks it was F. Ferdinand Alvarez,who became her confessor on the removal of F. Juan de Padranos,and that it was to him she confessed till she placed herselfunder the direction of F. Baltasar Alvarez, the confessor of DoñaGuiomar, as it is stated in the next paragraph,--unless theconfessor there mentioned was F. Ferdinand.6. Doña Guiomar de Ulloa.  See below, ch. xxxii. § 13.7. If this confessor was F. Baltasar Alvarez, the Saint, F. Bouixobserves, passes rapidly over the history of the year 1557, andthe greater part, perhaps, of 1558; for F. Baltasar was ordainedpriest only in the latter year.8. See Relation, i. § 6.
ISFJ	 XXV.Divine Locutions.  Discussions on That Subject.1. It will be as well, I think, to explain these locutions ofGod, and to describe what the soul feels when it receives them,in order that you, my father, may understand the matter; for eversince that time of which I am speaking, when our Lord granted methat grace, it has been an ordinary occurrence until now, as willappear by what I have yet to say. [1]2. The words are very distinctly formed; but by the bodily earthey are not heard.  They are, however, much more clearlyunderstood than they would be if they were heard by the ear.It is impossible not to understand them, whatever resistance wemay offer.  When we wish not to hear anything in this world, wecan stop our ears, or give attention to something else: so that,even if we do hear, at least we can refuse to understand.In this locution of God addressed to the soul there is no escape,for in spite of ourselves we must listen; and the understandingmust apply itself so thoroughly to the comprehension of thatwhich God wills we should hear, that it is nothing to the purposewhether we will it or not; for it is His will, Who can do allthings.  We should understand that His will must be done; and Hereveals Himself as our true Lord, having dominion over us.I know this by much experience; for my resistance lasted nearlytwo years, [2] because of the great fear I was in: and even now Iresist occasionally; but it is of no use.3. I should like to explain the delusions which may happen here,though he who has had much experience will run little or no risk,I think; but the experience must be great.  I should like toexplain also how those locutions which come from the Good Spiritdiffer from those which come from an evil spirit; and, further,how they may be but an apprehension of the understanding,--forthat is possible,--or even words which the mind addressed toitself.  I do not know if it be so but even this very day Ithought it possible.  I know by experience in many ways, whenthese locutions come from God.  I have been told things two orthree years beforehand, which have all come to pass; and in noneof them have I been hitherto deceived.  There are also otherthings in which the Spirit of God may be clearly traced, as Ishall relate by and by. [3]4. It seems to me that a person commending a matter to God withgreat love and earnestness may think that he hears in some way orother whether his prayer will be granted or not, and this isquite possible; but he who has heard the divine locution will seeclearly enough what this is, because there is a great differencebetween the two.  If it be anything which the understanding hasfashioned, however cunningly it may have done so, he sees that itis the understanding which has arranged that locution, and thatit is speaking of itself.  This is nothing else but a worduttered by one, and listened to by another: in that case, theunderstanding will see that it has not been listening only, butalso forming the words; and the words it forms are somethingindistinct, fantastic, and not clear like the divine locutions.It is in our power to turn away our attention from theselocutions of our own, just as we can be silent when we arespeaking; but, with respect to the former, that cannot be done.5. There is another test more decisive still.  The words formedby the understanding effect nothing; but, when our Lord speaks,it is at once word and work; and though the words may not bemeant to stir up our devotion, but are rather words of reproof,they dispose a soul at once, strengthen it, make it tender, giveit light, console and calm it; and if it should be in dryness, orin trouble and uneasiness, all is removed, as if by the action ofa hand, and even better; for it seems as if our Lord would havethe soul understand that He is all-powerful, and that His wordsare deeds.6. It seems to me that there is as much difference between thesetwo locutions as there is between speaking and listening, neithermore nor less; for when I speak, as I have just said, [4] I go onwith my understanding arranging what I am saying; but if I amspoken to by others, I do nothing else but listen, without anylabour.  The human locution is as something which we cannot wellmake out, as if we were half asleep; but the divine locution is avoice so clear that not a syllable of its utterance is lost.It may occur, too, when the understanding and the soul are sotroubled and distracted that they cannot form one sentencecorrectly; and yet grand sentences, perfectly arranged, such asthe soul in its most recollected state never could have formed,are uttered, and at the first word, as I said, [5] change itutterly.  Still less could it have formed them if they areuttered in an ecstasy, when the faculties of the soul aresuspended; for how should the soul then comprehend anything, whenit remembers nothing?--yea, rather, how can it remember themthen, when the memory can hardly do anything at all, and theimagination is, as it were, suspended?7. But it is to be observed, that if we see visions and hearwords it never is as at the time when the soul is in union in thevery rapture itself,--so it seems to me.  At that moment, as Ihave shown,--I think it was when I was speaking of the secondwater, [6]--all the faculties of the soul are suspended; and, asI think, neither vision, nor understanding, nor hearing, ispossible at that time.  The soul is then wholly in the power ofanother; and in that instant--a very brief one, in myopinion--our Lord leaves it free for nothing whatever; but whenthis instant is passed, the soul continuing still entranced, thenis the time of which I am speaking; for the faculties, though notcompletely suspended, are so disposed that they are scarcelyactive, being, as it were, absorbed, and incapable of makingany reflections.8. There are so many ways of ascertaining the nature of theselocutions, that if a person be once deceived, he will not bedeceived often.  I mean, that a soul accustomed to them, and onits guard, will most clearly see what they are; for, settingother considerations aside which prove what I have said, thehuman locution produces no effect, neither does the soul acceptit,--though it must admit the other, whether we like it ornot,--nor does it believe it; on the contrary, it is known to bea delusion of the understanding, and is therefore put away as wewould put away the ravings of a lunatic.9. But as to the divine locution, we listen to that as we do to aperson of great holiness, learning, or authority, whom we know tobe incapable of uttering a falsehood.  And yet this is aninadequate illustration; for these locutions proceed occasionallyin such great majesty that, without our recollecting who it isthat utters them, they make us tremble if they be words ofreproof, and die of love if words of love.  They are also, as Ihave said, [7] matters of which the memory has not the leastrecollection; and expressions so full are uttered so rapidly,that much time must have been spent in arranging them, if weformed them ourselves; and so it seems to me that we cannotpossibly be ignorant at the time that we have never formed themourselves at all.10. There is no reason, therefore, why I should dwell longer onthis matter.  It is a wonder to me that any experienced person,unless he deliberately chooses to do so, can fall into delusions.It has often happened to me, when I had doubts, to distrust whatI had heard, and to think that it was all imagination,--but thisI did afterwards: for at the moment that is impossible,--and at alater time to see the whole fulfilled; for our Lord makes thewords dwell in the memory so that they cannot be forgotten.Now, that which comes forth from our understanding is, as itwere, the first movement of thought, which passes away and isforgotten; but the divine locution is a work done; and thoughsome of it may be forgotten, and time have lapsed, yet is not sowholly forgotten that the memory loses all traces of what wasonce spoken,--unless, indeed, after very long time, or unless thelocution were words of grace or of instruction.  But as toprophetic words, they are never forgotten, in my opinion; atleast, I have never forgotten any,--and yet my memory is weak.11. I repeat it, unless a soul be so wicked as to pretend that ithas these locutions, which would be a great sin, and say that ithears divine words when it hears nothing of the kind, it cannotpossibly fail to see clearly that itself arranges the words, andutters them to itself.  That seems to me altogether impossiblefor any soul that has ever known the Spirit of God.  If it hasnot, it may continue all its life long in this delusion, andimagine that it hears and understands, though I know not how thatcan be.  A soul desires to hear these locutions, or it does not;if it does not, it is distressed because it hears them, and isunwilling to listen to them, because of a thousand fears whichthey occasion, and for many other reasons it has for being quietin prayer without these interruptions.  How is it that theunderstanding has time enough to arrange these locutions?They require time.12. But, on the other side, the divine locutions instruct uswithout loss of time, and we understand matters which seem torequire a month on our part to arrange.  The understandingitself, and the soul, stand amazed at some of the things weunderstand.  So it is; and he who has any experience of it willsee that what I am saying is literally true.  I give God thanksthat I have been able thus to explain it.  I end by saying that,in my opinion, we may hear the locutions that proceed from theunderstanding whenever we like, and think that we hear themwhenever we pray.  But it is not so with the divine locutions:for many days I may desire to hear them, and I cannot; and atother times, even when I would not, as I said before, [8] hearthem, I must.  It seems to me that any one disposed to deceivepeople by saying that he heard from God that which he hasinvented himself, might as easily say that he heard it with hisbodily ears.  It is most certainly true that I never imaginedthere was any other way of hearing or understanding till I hadproof of it in myself; and so, as I have said before, [9] it gaveme trouble enough.13. Locutions that come from Satan not only do not leave any goodeffects behind, but do leave evil effects.  This has happened tome; but not more than two or three times.  Our Lord warned me atonce that they came from Satan.  Over and above the great ariditywhich remains in the soul after these evil locutions, there isalso a certain disquiet, such as I have had on many otheroccasions, when, by our Lord's permission, I fell into greattemptations and travail of soul in diverse ways; and though I amin trouble often enough, as I shall show hereafter, [10] yet thisdisquiet is such that I know not whence it comes; only the soulseems to resist, is troubled and distressed, without knowing why;for the words of Satan are good, and not evil.  I am thinkingwhether this may not be so because one spirit is conscious of thepresence of another.14. The sweetness and joy which Satan gives are, in my opinion,of a very different kind.  By means of these sweetnesses he maydeceive any one who does not, or who never did, taste of thesweetness of God,--by which I mean a certain sweet, strong,impressive, delightsome, and calm refreshing.  Those little,fervid bursts of tears, and other slight emotions,--for at thefirst breath of persecution these flowers wither,--I do not calldevotion, though they are a good beginning, and are holyimpressions; but they are not a test to determine whether theselocutions come from a good or an evil spirit.  It is thereforebest for us to proceed always with great caution; for thosepersons who have advanced in prayer only so far as this may mosteasily fall into delusions, if they have visions or revelations.For myself, I never had a single vision or revelation till Godhad led me on to the prayer of union,--unless it be on thatoccasion, of which I have spoken before, [11] now many years ago,when I saw our Lord.  Oh, that His Majesty had been pleased tolet me then understand that it was a true vision, as I have sinceunderstood it was! it would have been no slight blessing to me.15. After these locutions of the evil one, the soul is nevergentle, but is, as it were, terrified, and greatly disgusted.16. I look upon it as a most certain truth, that the devil willnever deceive, and that God will not suffer him to deceive, thesoul which has no confidence whatever in itself; which is strongin faith, and resolved to undergo a thousand deaths for any onearticle of the creed; which in its love of the faith, infused ofGod once for all,--a faith living and strong,--always labours,seeking for further light on this side and on that, to moulditself on the teaching of the Church, as one already deeplygrounded in the truth.  No imaginable revelations, not even if itsaw the heavens open, could make that soul swerve in any degreefrom the doctrine of the Church.  If, however, it should at anytime find itself wavering even in thought on this point, orstopping to say to itself, If God says this to me, it may betrue, as well as what He said to the Saints--the soul must not besure of it.  I do not mean that it so believes, only that Satanhas taken the first step towards tempting it; and the giving wayto the first movements of a thought like this is evidently mostwrong.  I believe, however, that these first movements will nottake place if the soul is so strong in the matter--as that soulis to whom our Lord sends these graces--that it seems as if itcould crush the evil spirits in defence of the very least of thetruths which the Church holds.17. If the soul does not discern this great strength in itself,and if the particular devotion or vision help it not onwards,then it must not look upon it as safe.  For though at first thesoul is conscious of no harm, great harm may by degrees ensue;because, so far as I can see, and by experience understand, thatwhich purports to come from God is received only in so far as itcorresponds with the sacred writings; but if it varies therefromever so little, I am incomparably more convinced that it comesfrom Satan than I am now convinced it comes from God, howeverdeep that conviction may be.  In this case, there is no need toask for signs, nor from what spirit it proceeds, because thisvarying is so clear a sign of the devil's presence, that if allthe world were to assure me that it came from God, I would notbelieve it.  The fact is, that all good seems to be lost out ofsight, and to have fled from the soul, when the devil has spokento it; the soul is thrown into a state of disgust, and istroubled, able to do no good thing whatever--for if it conceivesgood desires, they are not strong; its humility is fictitious,disturbed, and without sweetness.  Any one who has ever tasted ofthe Spirit of God will, I think, understand it.18. Nevertheless, Satan has many devices; and so there is nothingmore certain than that it is safer to be afraid, and always onour guard, under a learned director, from whom nothing isconcealed.  If we do this, no harm can befall us, though much hasbefallen me through the excessive fears which possessed somepeople.  For instance, it happened so once to me, when manypersons in whom I had great confidence, and with good reason, hadassembled together,--five or six in number, I think,--and allvery great servants of God.  It is true, my relations were withone of them only; but by his orders made my state known to theothers.  They had many conferences together about my necessities;for they had great affection for me, and were afraid I was undera delusion.  I, too, was very much afraid whenever I was notoccupied in prayer; but when I prayed, and our Lord bestowed Hisgraces upon me, I was instantly reassured.  My confessor told methey were all of opinion that I was deceived by Satan; that Imust communicate less frequently, and contrive to distract myselfin such a way as to be less alone.19. I was in great fear myself, as I have just said, and mydisease of the heart [12] contributed thereto, so that very oftenI did not dare to remain alone in my cell during the day.  When Ifound so many maintain this, and myself unable to believe them, Ihad at once a most grievous scruple; for it seemed to me that Ihad very little humility, especially as they all led livesincomparably better than mine: they were also learned men.Why should I not believe them?  I did all I could to believethem.  I reflected on my wicked life, and therefore what theysaid to me must be true.20. In this distress, I quitted the church, [13] and entered anoratory.  I had not been to Communion for many days, nor had Ibeen alone, which was all my comfort.  I had no one to speak to,for every one was against me.  Some, I thought, made a mock of mewhen I spoke to them of my prayer, as if I were a person underdelusions of the imagination; others warned my confessor to be onhis guard against me; and some said it was clear the whole was anoperation of Satan.  My confessor, though he agreed with them forthe sake of trying me, as I understood afterwards, alwayscomforted me: and he alone did so.  He told me that, if I did notoffend God, my prayer, even if it was the work of Satan, could dome no harm; that I should be delivered from it.  He bade me praymuch to God: he himself, and all his penitents, and many othersdid so earnestly; I, too, with all my might, and as many as Iknew to be servants of God, prayed that His Majesty would bepleased to lead me by another way.  This lasted, I think, abouttwo years; and this was the subject of my continual prayer toour Lord.21. But there was no comfort for me when I thought of thepossibility that Satan could speak to me so often.  Now that Iwas never alone for prayer, our Lord made me recollected evenduring conversation: He spoke what He pleased,--I could not avoidit; and, though it distressed me, I was forced to listen.  I wasby myself, having no one in whom I could find any comfort; unableto pray or read, like a person stunned by heavy trials, and bythe dread that the evil one had deluded me; utterly disquietedand wearied, not knowing what would become of me.  I have beenoccasionally--yea, very often--in distress, but never before indistress so great.  I was in this state for four or five hours;there was no comfort for me, either from heaven or on earth--onlyour Lord left me to suffer, afraid of a thousand dangers.22. O my Lord, how true a friend art Thou! how powerful!Thou showest Thy power when Thou wilt; and Thou dost will italways, if only we will it also.  Let the whole creation praiseThee, O Thou Lord of the world!  Oh, that a voice might go forthover all the earth, proclaiming Thy faithfulness to those wholove Thee! All things fail; but Thou, Lord of all, never failest!They who love Thee, oh, how little they have to suffer! oh, howgently, how tenderly, how sweetly Thou, O my Lord, dealest withthem! Oh, that no one had ever been occupied with any other lovethan Thine!  It seems as if Thou didst subject those who loveThee to a severe trial: but it is in order that they may learn,in the depths of that trial, the depths of Thy love.  O my God,oh, that I had understanding and learning, and a new language, inorder to magnify Thy works, according to the knowledge of themwhich my soul possesses!  Everything fails me, O my Lord; but ifThou wilt not abandon me, I will never fail Thee.  Let all thelearned rise up against me,--let the whole creation persecuteme,--let the evil spirits torment me,--but do Thou, O Lord, failme not; for I know by experience now the blessedness of thatdeliverance which Thou dost effect for those who trust only inThee.  In this distress,--for then I had never had a singlevision,--these Thy words alone were enough to remove it, and giveme perfect peace: 'Be not afraid, my daughter: it is I; and Iwill not abandon thee.  Fear not.' [14]23. It seems to me that, in the state I was in then, many hourswould have been necessary to calm me, and that no one could havedone it.  Yet I found myself, through these words alone, tranquiland strong, courageous and confident, at rest and enlightened; ina moment, my soul seemed changed, and I felt I could maintainagainst all the world that my prayer was the work of God.Oh, how good is God! how good is our Lord, and how powerful!He gives not counsel only, but relief as well.  His words aredeeds. O my God! as He strengthens our faith, love grows.  So itis, in truth; for I used frequently to recollect how our Lord,when the tempest arose, commanded the winds to be still over thesea. [15] So I said to myself: Who is He, that all my facultiesshould thus obey Him?  Who is He, that gives light in suchdarkness in a moment; who softens a heart that seemed to be madeof stone; who gives the waters of sweet tears, where for a longtime great dryness seems to have prevailed; who inspires thesedesires; who bestows this courage?  What have I been thinking of?what am I afraid of? what is it?  I desire to serve this my Lord;I aim at nothing else but His pleasure; I seek no joy, no rest,no other good than that of doing His will.  I was so confidentthat I had no other desire, that I could safely assert it.24. Seeing, then, that our Lord is so powerful,--as I see andknow He is,--and that the evil spirits are His slaves, of whichthere can be no doubt, because it is of faith,--and I a servantof this our Lord and King,--what harm can Satan do unto me?Why have I not strength enough to fight against all hell?  I tookup the cross in my hand,--I was changed in a moment into anotherperson, and it seemed as if God had really given me courageenough not to be afraid of encountering all the evil spirits.It seemed to me that I could, with the cross, easily defeat themaltogether.  So I cried out, Come on, all of you; I am theservant of our Lord: I should like to see what you can doagainst me.25. And certainly they seemed to be afraid of me, for I was leftin peace: I feared them so little, that the terrors, which untilnow oppressed me, quitted me altogether; and though I saw themoccasionally,--I shall speak of this by and by, [16]--I was neveragain afraid of them--on the contrary, they seemed to be afraidof me. [17]  I found myself endowed with a certain authority overthem, given me by the Lord of all, so that I cared no more forthem than for flies.  They seem to be such cowards; for theirstrength fails them at the sight of any one who despises them.These enemies have not the courage to assail any but those whomthey see ready to give in to them, or when God permits them to doso, for the greater good of His servants, whom they may tryand torment.26. May it please His Majesty that we fear Him whom we ought tofear, [18] and understand that one venial sin can do us more harmthan all hell together; for that is the truth.  The evil spiritskeep us in terror, because we expose ourselves to the assaults ofterror by our attachments to honours, possessions, and pleasures.For then the evil spirits, uniting themselves with us,--we becomeour own enemies when we love and seek what we ought to hate,--dous great harm.  We ourselves put weapons into their hands, thatthey may assail us; those very weapons with which we shoulddefend ourselves.  It is a great pity.  But if, for the love ofGod, we hated all this, and embraced the cross, and set about Hisservice in earnest, Satan would fly away before such realities,as from the plague.  He is the friend of lies, and a liehimself. [19]  He will have nothing to do with those who walk inthe truth.  When he sees the understanding of any one obscured,he simply helps to pluck out his eyes; if he sees any one alreadyblind, seeking peace in vanities,--for all the things of thisworld are so utterly vanity, that they seem to be but theplaythings of a child,--he sees at once that such a one is achild; he treats him as a child, and ventures to wrestle withhim--not once, but often.27. May it please our Lord that I be not one of these; and mayHis Majesty give me grace to take that for peace which is reallypeace, that for honour which is really honour, and that fordelight which is really a delight.  Let me never mistake onething for another--and then I snap my fingers at all the devils,for they shall be afraid of me.  I do not understand thoseterrors which make us cry out, Satan, Satan! when we may say,God, God! and make Satan tremble.  Do we not know that he cannotstir without the permission of God?  What does it mean?  I amreally much more afraid of those people who have so great a fearof the devil, than I am of the devil himself.  Satan can do me noharm whatever, but they can trouble me very much, particularly ifthey be confessors.  I have spent some years of such greatanxiety, that even now I am amazed that I was able to bear it.Blessed be our Lord, who has so effectually helped me!1. Philip. a SS. Trinitate, Theolog.

ISFJ	 XXVI.How the Fears of the Saint Vanished.  How She Was Assured ThatHer Prayer Was the Work of the Holy Spirit.1. I look upon the courage which our Lord has implanted in meagainst evil spirits as one of the greatest mercies which He hasbestowed upon me; for a cowardly soul, afraid of anything but sinagainst God, is a very unseemly thing, when we have on our sidethe King omnipotent, our Lord most high, who can do all things,and subjects all things to Himself.  There is nothing to beafraid of if we walk, as I said before, [1] in the truth, in thesight of His Majesty, with a pure conscience.  And for this end,as I said in the same place, I would have myself all fears, thatI may not for one instant offend Him who in that instant is ableto destroy us.  If His Majesty is pleased with us, whoeverresists us--be he who he may--will be utterly disappointed.2. It may be so, you will say; but, then, where is that soul sojust as to please Him in everything?--and that is the reason whywe are afraid.  Certainly it is not my soul, which is mostwretched, unprofitable, and full of misery.  God is not like manin His ways; He knows our weakness.  But the soul perceives, bythe help of certain great signs, whether it loves God of a truth;for the love of those souls who have come to this state is nothidden as it was at first, but is full of high impulses, and oflongings for the vision of God, as I shall show hereafter--orrather, as I have shown already. [2]  Everything wearies,everything distresses, everything torments the soul, unless it besuffered with God, or for God.  There is no rest which is not aweariness, because the soul knows itself to be away from its truerest; and so love is made most manifest, and, as I have justsaid, impossible to hide.3. It happened to me, on another occasion to be grievously tried,and much spoken against on account of a certain affair,--of whichI will speak hereafter, [3]--by almost everybody in the placewhere I am living, and by the members of my Order.  When I was inthis distress, and afflicted by many occasions of disquietwherein I was placed, our Lord spoke to me, saying: 'What artthou afraid of? knowest thou not that I am almighty?  I will dowhat I have promised thee.'  And so, afterwards, was it done.I found myself at once so strong, that I could have undertakenanything, so it seemed, immediately, even if I had to enduregreater trials for His service, and had to enter on a new stateof suffering.  These locutions are so frequent, that I cannotcount them; many of them are reproaches, and He sends them when Ifall into imperfections.  They are enough to destroy a soul.They correct me, however; for His Majesty--as I saidbefore [4]--gives both counsel and relief.  There are otherswhich bring my former sins into remembrance,--particularly whenHe is about to bestow upon me some special grace,--in such a waythat the soul beholds itself as being really judged; for thosereproaches of God put the truth before it so distinctly, that itknows not what to do with itself.  Some are warnings againstcertain dangers to myself or others; many of them are propheciesof future things, three or four years beforehand; and all of themhave been fulfilled: some of them I could mention.  Here, then,are so many reasons for believing that they come from God, asmake it impossible, I believe, for anybody to mistake them.4. The safest course in these things is to declare, without fail,the whole state of the soul, together with the graces our Lordgives me, to a confessor who is learned, and obey him.  I do so;and if I did not, I should have no peace.  Nor is it right thatwe women, who are unlearned, should have any: there can be nodanger in this, but rather great profit.  This is what our Lordhas often commanded me to do, and it is what I have often done.I had a confessor [5] who mortified me greatly, and now and thendistressed me: he tried me heavily, for he disquieted meexceedingly; and yet he was the one who, I believe, did me themost good.  Though I had a great affection for him, I wasoccasionally tempted to leave him; I thought that the pain heinflicted on me disturbed my prayer.  Whenever I was resolved onleaving him, I used to feel instantly that I ought not to do so;and one reproach of our Lord would press more heavily upon methan all that my confessor did.  Now and then, I was wornout--torture on the one hand, reproaches on the other.I required it all, for my will was but little subdued.  Our Lordsaid to me once, that there was no obedience where there was noresolution to suffer; that I was to think of His sufferings, andthen everything would be easy.5. One of my confessors, to whom I went in the beginning, advisedme once, now that my spiritual state was known to be the work ofGod, to keep silence, and not speak of these things to any one,on the ground that it was safer to keep these graces secret.To me, the advice seemed good, because I felt it so much wheneverI had to speak of them to my confessor; [6] I was also so ashamedof myself, that I felt it more keenly at times to speak of themthan I should have done in confessing grave sins, particularlywhen the graces I had to reveal were great.  I thought they didnot believe me, and that they were laughing at me.  I felt it somuch,--for I look on this as an irreverent treatment of themarvels of God,--that I was glad to be silent. I learned thenthat I had been ill-advised by that confessor, because I oughtnever to hide anything from my confessor; for I should find greatsecurity if I told everything; and if I did otherwise, I might atany time fall into delusions. [7]6. Whenever our Lord commanded me to do one thing in prayer, andif my confessor forbade it, our Lord Himself told me to obey myconfessor.  His Majesty afterwards would change the mind of thatconfessor, so that he would have me do what he had forbiddenbefore.  When we were deprived of many books written in Spanish,and forbidden to read them,--I felt it deeply, for some of thesebooks were a great comfort to me, and I could not read them inLatin,--our Lord said to me, 'Be not troubled; I will give thee aliving book.'  I could not understand why this was said to me,for at that time I had never had a vision. [8]  But, a very fewdays afterwards, I understood it well enough; for I had so muchto think of, and such reasons for self-recollection in what I sawbefore me and our Lord dealt so lovingly with me, in teaching mein so many ways, that I had little or no need whatever of books.His Majesty has been to me a veritable Book, in which I saw alltruth.  Blessed be such a Book, which leaves behind an impressionof what is read therein, and in such a way that it cannotbe forgotten!7. Who can look upon our Lord, covered with wounds, and boweddown under persecutions, without accepting, loving, and longingfor them?  Who can behold but a part of that glory which He willgive to those who serve Him without confessing that all he maydo, and all he may suffer, are altogether as nothing, when we mayhope for such a reward?  Who can look at the torments of lostsouls without acknowledging the torments of this life to bejoyous delights in comparison, and confessing how much they oweto our Lord in having saved them so often from the place oftorments? [9]  But as, by the help of God, I shall speak more atlarge of certain things, I wish now to go on with the story of mylife.  Our Lord grant that I have been clear enough in what Ihave hitherto said!  I feel assured that he will understand mewho has had experience herein, and that he will see I havepartially succeeded; but as to him who has had no suchexperience, I should not be surprised if he regarded it all asfolly.  It is enough for him that it is I who say it, in order tobe free from blame; neither will I blame any one who shall sospeak of it.  Our Lord grant that I may never fail to do Hiswill!  Amen.1.

The Bollandists, n. 185, attribute some of the severity withwhich her confessor treated the Saint to the spirit of desolationwith which he was then tried himself; and, in proof of it, referto the account which F. Baltasar Alvarez gave of his own prayerto the General of the Society.6. See Relation, vii. § 7.7. St. John of the Cross, Mount Carmel, bk. ii. ch. 22, § 14.8.

ISFJ	 XXVII.The Saint Prays to Be Directed by a Different Way.Intellectual Visions.1. I now resume the story of my life.  I was in great pain anddistress; and many prayers, as I said, [1] were made on mybehalf, that our Lord would lead me by another and a safer way;for this, they told me, was so suspicious.  The truth is, thatthough I was praying to God for this, and wished I had a desirefor another way, yet, when I saw the progress I was making, I wasunable really to desire a change,--though I always prayed forit,--excepting on those occasions when I was extremely cast downby what people said to me, and by the fears with which theyfilled me.2. I felt that I was wholly changed; I could do nothing but putmyself in the hands of God: He knew what was expedient for me;let Him do with me according to His will in all things.  I sawthat by this way I was directed heavenwards, and that formerly Iwas going down to hell.  I could not force myself to desire achange, nor believe that I was under the influence of Satan.Though I was doing all I could to believe the one and to desirethe other, it was not in my power to do so.  I offered up all myactions, if there should be any good in them, for this end; I hadrecourse to the Saints for whom I had a devotion, that they mightdeliver me from the evil one; I made novenas; I commended myselfto St. Hilarion, to the Angel St. Michael, to whom I had recentlybecome devout, for this purpose; and many other Saints Iimportuned, that our Lord might show me the way,--I mean, thatthey might obtain this for me from His Majesty.3. At the end of two years spent in prayer by myself and othersfor this end, namely, that our Lord would either lead me byanother way, or show the truth of this,--for now the locutions ofour Lord were extremely frequent,--this happened to me.  I was inprayer one day,--it was the feast of the gloriousSt. Peter, [2]--when I saw Christ close by me, or, to speak morecorrectly, felt Him; for I saw nothing with the eyes of the body,nothing with the eyes of the soul.  He seemed to me to be closebeside me; and I saw, too, as I believe, that it was He who wasspeaking to me. As I was utterly ignorant that such a vision waspossible, [3] I was extremely afraid at first, and did nothingbut weep; however, when He spoke to me but one word to reassureme, I recovered myself, and was, as usual, calm and comforted,without any fear whatever.  Jesus Christ seemed to be by my sidecontinually, and, as the vision was not imaginary, I saw no form;but I had a most distinct feeling that He was always on my righthand, a witness of all I did; and never at any time, if I was butslightly recollected, or not too much distracted, could I beignorant of His near presence. [4]4. I went at once to my confessor, [5] in great distress, to tellhim of it.  He asked in what form I saw our Lord.  I told him Isaw no form.  He then said: 'How did you know that it wasChrist?'  I replied, that I did not know how I knew it; but Icould not help knowing that He was close beside me,--that I sawHim distinctly, and felt His presence,--that the recollectednessof my soul was deeper in the prayer of quiet, and morecontinuous,--that the effects thereof were very different fromwhat I had hitherto experienced,--and that it was most certain.I could only make comparisons in order to explain myself; andcertainly there are no comparisons, in my opinion, by whichvisions of this kind can be described.  Afterwards I learnt fromFriar Peter of Alcantara, a holy man of great spirituality,--ofwhom I shall speak by and by, [6]--and from others of greatlearning, that this vision was of the highest order, and one withwhich Satan can least interfere; and therefore there are no wordswhereby to explain,--at least, none for us women, who know solittle: learned men can explain it better.5. For if I say that I see Him neither with the eyes of the body,nor with those of the soul,--because it was not an imaginaryvision,--how is it that I can understand and maintain that Hestands beside me, and be more certain of it than if I saw Him?If it be supposed that it is as if a person were blind, or in thedark, and therefore unable to see another who is close to him,the comparison is not exact.  There is a certain likelihood aboutit, however, but not much, because the other senses tell him whois blind of that presence: he hears the other speak or move, orhe touches him; but in these visions there is nothing like this.The darkness is not felt; only He renders Himself present to thesoul by a certain knowledge of Himself which is more clear thanthe sun. [7]  I do not mean that we now see either a sun or anybrightness, only that there is a light not seen, which illuminesthe understanding so that the soul may have the fruition of sogreat a good.  This vision brings with it great blessings.6. It is not like that presence of God which is frequently felt,particularly by those who have attained to the prayer of unionand of quiet, when we seem, at the very commencement of ourprayer, to find Him with whom we would converse, and when we seemto feel that He hears us by the effects and the spiritualimpressions of great love and faith of which we are thenconscious, as well as by the good resolutions, accompanied bysweetness, which we then make.  This is a great grace from God;and let him to whom He has given it esteem it much, because it isa very high degree of prayer; but it is not vision.  God isunderstood to be present there by the effects He works in thesoul: that is the way His Majesty makes His presence felt; buthere, in this vision, it is seen clearly that Jesus Christ ispresent, the Son of the Virgin.  In the prayer of union and ofquiet, certain inflowings of the Godhead are present; but in thevision, the Sacred Humanity also, together with them, is pleasedto be our visible companion, and to do us good.7. My confessor next asked me, who told me it was JesusChrist. [8]  I replied that He often told me so Himself; but,even before He told me so, there was an impression on myunderstanding that it was He; and before this He used to tell meso, and I saw Him not.  If a person whom I had never seen, but ofwhom I had heard, came to speak to me, and I were blind or in thedark, and told me who he was, I should believe him; but I couldnot so confidently affirm that he was that person, as I might doif I had seen him.  But in this vision I could do so, because soclear a knowledge is impressed on the soul that all doubt seemsimpossible, though He is not seen.  Our Lord wills that thisknowledge be so graven on the understanding, that we can no morequestion His presence than we can question that which we see withour eyes: not so much even; for very often there arises asuspicion that we have imagined things we think we see; but here,though there may be a suspicion in the first instant, thereremains a certainty so great, that the doubt has no forcewhatever.  So also is it when God teaches the soul in anotherway, and speaks to it without speaking, in the way Ihave described.8. There is so much of heaven in this language, that it cannotwell be understood on earth, though we may desire ever so much toexplain it, if our Lord will not teach it experimentally.Our Lord impresses in the innermost soul that which He wills thatsoul to understand; and He manifests it there without images orformal words, after the manner of the vision I am speaking of.Consider well this way in which God works, in order that the soulmay understand what He means--His great truths and mysteries; forvery often what I understand, when our Lord explains to me thevision, which it is His Majesty's pleasure to set before me, isafter this manner; and it seems to me that this is a state withwhich the devil can least interfere, for these reasons; but ifthese reasons are not good, I must be under a delusion.  Thevision and the language are matters of such pure spirituality,that there is no toil of the faculties, or of the senses, out ofwhich--so seems to me--the devil can derive any advantage.9. It is only at intervals, and for an instant, that this occurs;for generally--so I think--the senses are not taken away, and thefaculties are not suspended: they preserve their ordinary state.It is not always so in contemplation; on the contrary, it is veryrarely so; but when it is so, I say that we do nothing whateverourselves: no work of ours is then possible; all that is done isapparently the work of our Lord.  It is as if food had beenreceived into the stomach which had not first been eaten, andwithout our knowing how it entered; but we do know well that itis there, though we know not its nature, nor who it was thatplaced it there.  In this vision, I know who placed it; but I donot know how He did it.  I neither saw it, nor felt it; I neverhad any inclination to desire it, and I never knew before thatsuch a thing was possible.10. In the locutions of which I spoke before, [9] God makes theunderstanding attentive, though it may be painful to understandwhat is said; then the soul seems to have other ears wherewith ithears; and He forces it to listen, and will not let it bedistracted.  The soul is like a person whose hearing was good,and who is not suffered to stop his ears, while people standingclose beside him speak to him with a loud voice.  He may beunwilling to hear, yet hear he must.  Such a person contributessomething of his own; for he attends to what is said to him; buthere there is nothing of the kind: even that little, which isnothing more than the bare act of listening, which is granted toit in the other case, is now out of its power.  It finds its foodprepared and eaten; it has nothing more to do but to enjoy it.It is as if one without ever learning, without taking the painseven to learn to read, and without studying any subject whatever,should find himself in possession of all knowledge, not knowinghow or whence it came to him, seeing that he had never taken thetrouble even to learn the alphabet.  This last comparison seemsto me to throw some light on this heavenly gift; for the soulfinds itself learned in a moment, and the mystery of the mostHoly Trinity so clearly revealed to it, together with other mostdeep doctrines, that there is no theologian in the world withwhom it would hesitate to dispute for the truth of these matters.11. It is impossible to describe the surprise of the soul when itfinds that one of these graces is enough to change it utterly,and make it love nothing but Him who, without waiting foranything itself might do, renders it fit for blessings so high,communicates to it His secrets, and treats it with so muchaffection and love.  Some of the graces He bestows are liable tosuspicion because they are so marvellous, and given to one whohas deserved them so little--incredible, too, without a mostlively faith.  I intend, therefore, to mention very few of thosegraces which our Lord has wrought in me, if I should not beordered otherwise; but there are certain visions of which I shallspeak, an account of which may be of some service.  In doing so,I shall either dispel his fears to whom our Lord sends them, andwho, as I used to do, thinks them impossible, or I shall explainthe way or the road by which our Lord has led me; and that iswhat I have been commanded to describe.12. Now, going back to speak of this way of understanding, whatit is seems to me to be this: it is our Lord's will in every waythat the soul should have some knowledge of what passes inheaven; and I think that, as the blessed there without speechunderstand one another,--I never knew this for certain till ourLord of His goodness made me see it; He showed it to me in atrance,--so is it here: God and the soul understand one another,merely because His Majesty so wills it, without the help of othermeans, to express the love there is between them both.  In thesame way on earth, two persons of sound sense, if they love eachother much, can even, without any signs, understand one anotheronly by their looks.  It must be so here, though we do not seehow, as these two lovers earnestly regard each the other: thebridegroom says so to the bride in the Canticle, so I believe,and I have heard that it is spoken of there. [10]13. Oh, marvellous goodness of God, in that Thou permittest eyeswhich have looked upon so much evil as those of my soul to lookupon Thee!  May they never accustom themselves, after looking onThee, to look upon vile things again! and may they have pleasurein nothing but in Thee, O Lord!  Oh, ingratitude of men, how farwill it go!  I know by experience that what I am saying is true,and that all we can say is exceedingly little, when we considerwhat Thou doest to the soul which Thou hast led to such a stateas this.  O souls, you who have begun to pray, and you whopossess the true faith, what can you be in search of even in thislife, let alone that which is for ever, that is comparable to theleast of these graces?  Consider, and it is true, that God givesHimself to those who give up everything for Him.  God is not anaccepter of persons. [11]  He loves all; there is no excuse forany one, however wicked he may be, seeing that He hath thus dealtwith me, raising me to the state I am in. Consider, that what Iam saying is not even an iota of what may be said; I say onlythat which is necessary to show the kind of the vision and of thegrace which God bestows on the soul; for that cannot be toldwhich it feels when our Lord admits it to the understanding ofHis secrets and of His mighty works.  The joy of this is so farabove all conceivable joys, that it may well make us loathe allthe joys of earth; for they are all but dross; and it is anodious thing to make them enter into the comparison, even if wemight have them for ever.  Those which our Lord gives, what arethey?  One drop only of the waters of the overflowing river whichHe is reserving for us.14. It is a shame!  And, in truth, I am ashamed of myself; ifshame could have a place in heaven, I should certainly be themost ashamed there.  Why do we seek blessings and joys so great,bliss without end, and all at the cost of our good Jesus?Shall we not at least weep with the daughters of Jerusalem, [12]if we do not help to carry his cross with the Cyrenean? [13]Is it by pleasure and idle amusements that we can attain to thefruition of what He purchased with so much blood?  It isimpossible.  Can we think that we can, by preserving our honour,which is vanity, recompense Him for the sufferings He endured,that we might reign with Him for ever?  This is not the way; weare going by the wrong road utterly, and we shall never arrivethere.  You, my father, must lift up your voice, and utter thesetruths aloud, seeing that God has taken from me the power ofdoing it.  I should like to utter them to myself for ever.I listened to them myself, and came to the knowledge of God solate, as will appear by what I have written, that I am ashamed ofmyself when I speak of this; and so I should like to be silent.15. Of one thing, however, I will speak, and I think of it nowand then,--may it be the good pleasure of our Lord to bring meon, so that I may have the fruition of it!--what will be theaccidental glory and the joy of the blessed who have entered onit, when they see that, though they were late, yet they leftnothing undone which it was possible for them to do for God, whokept nothing back they could give Him, and who gave what theygave in every way they could, according to their strength andtheir measure,--they who had more gave more.  How rich will he bewho gave up all his riches for Christ!  How honourable will he bewho, for His sake, sought no honours whatever, but rather tookpleasure in seeing himself abased!  How wise he will be whorejoiced when men accounted him as mad!--they did so of WisdomItself! [14]  How few there are of this kind now, because of oursins!  Now, indeed, they are all gone whom people regarded asmad, [15] because they saw them perform heroic acts, as truelovers of Christ.16. O world, world! how thou art gaining credit because they arefew who know thee!  But do we suppose that God is better pleasedwhen men account us wise and discreet persons?  We thinkforthwith that there is but little edification given when peopledo not go about, every one in his degree, with great gravity, ina dignified way.  Even in the friar, the ecclesiastic, and thenun, if they wear old and patched garments, we think it anovelty, and a scandal to the weak; and even if they are veryrecollected and given to prayer.  Such is the state of the world,and so forgotten are matters of perfection, and those grandimpetuosities of the Saints.  More mischief, I think, is done inthis way, than by any scandal that might arise if the religiousshowed in their actions, as they proclaim it in words, that theworld is to be held in contempt.  Out of scandals such as this,our Lord obtains great fruit.  If some people took scandal,others are filled with remorse: anyhow, we should have before ussome likeness of that which our Lord and His Apostles endured;for we have need of it now more than ever.17. And what an excellent likeness in the person of that blessedfriar, Peter of Alcantara, God has just taken from us! [16]The world cannot bear such perfection now; it is said that men'shealth is grown feebler, and that we are not now in those formertimes.  But this holy man lived in our day; he had a spiritstrong as those of another age, and so he trampled on the world.If men do not go about barefooted, nor undergo sharp penances, ashe did, there are many ways, as I have said before, [17] oftrampling on the world; and our Lord teaches them when He findsthe necessary courage. How great was the courage with which HisMajesty filled the Saint I am speaking of!  He did penance--oh,how sharp it was!--for seven-and-forty years, as all men know.I should like to speak of it, for I know it to be all true.18. He spoke of it to me and to another person, from whom he keptfew or no secrets.  As for me, it was the affection he bore methat led him to speak; for it was our Lord's will that he shouldundertake my defence, and encourage me, at a time when I was ingreat straits, as I said before, and shall speak of again. [18]He told me, I think, that for forty years he slept but an hourand a half out of the twenty-four, and that the most laboriouspenance he underwent, when he began, was this of overcomingsleep.  For that purpose, he was always either kneeling orstanding.  When he slept, he sat down, his head resting against apiece of wood driven into the wall.  Lie down he could not, if hewished it; for his cell, as every one knows, was only four feetand a half in length.  In all these years, he never covered hishead with his hood, even when the sun was hottest, or the rainheaviest.  He never covered his feet: the only garment he worewas made of sackcloth, and that was as tight as it could be, withnothing between it and his flesh; over this, he wore a cloak ofthe same stuff.  He told me that, in the severe cold, he used totake off his cloak, and open the door and the window of his cell,in order that when he put his cloak on again, after shutting thedoor and the window, he might give some satisfaction to his bodyin the pleasure it might have in the increased warmth.His ordinary practice was to eat but once in three days.  He saidto me, 'Why are you astonished at it? it is very possible for anyone who is used to it.'  One of his companions told me that hewould be occasionally eight days without eating: that must havebeen when he was in prayer; for he was subject to trances, and tothe impetuosities of the love of God, of which I was once awitness myself.19. His poverty was extreme; and his mortification, from hisyouth, was such,--so he told me,--that he was three years in oneof the houses of his Order without knowing how to distinguish onefriar from another, otherwise than by the voice; for he neverraised his eyes: and so, when he was obliged to go from one partof the house to the other, he never knew the way, unless hefollowed the friars.  His journeys, also, were made in the sameway.  For many years, he never saw a woman's face.  He told methat it was nothing to him then whether he saw it or not: but hewas an aged man when I made his acquaintance; and his weaknesswas so great, that he seemed like nothing else but the roots oftrees.  With all his sanctity, he was very agreeable; though hiswords were few, unless when he was asked questions; he was verypleasant to speak to, for he had a most clear understanding.20. Many other things I should like to say of him, if I were notafraid, my father, that you will say, Why does she meddle here?and it is in that fear I have written this.  So I leave thesubject, only saying that his last end was like hislife--preaching to, and exhorting, his brethren.  When he sawthat the end was comes he repeated the Psalm, [19] 'Lætatus sumin his quæ dicta sunt mihi;' and then, kneeling down, he died.21. Since then, it has pleased our Lord that I should find morehelp from him than during his life.  He advises me in manymatters.  I have often seen him in great glory.  The first timehe appeared to me, he said: 'O blessed penance, which has meritedso great a reward!' with other things.  A year before his death,he appeared to me being then far away.  I knew he was about todie, and so I sent him word to that effect, when he was someleagues from here.  When he died, he appeared to me, and saidthat he was going to his rest.  I did not believe it.  I spoke ofit to some persons, and within eight days came the news that hewas dead--or, to speak more correctly, he had begun to livefor evermore. [20]22. Behold here, then, how that life of sharp penance isperfected in such great glory: and now he is a greater comfort tome, I do believe, than he was on earth.  Our Lord said to me onone occasion, that persons could not ask Him anything in hisname, and He not hear them.  I have recommended many things tohim that he was to ask of our Lord, and I have seen my petitionsgranted.  God be blessed for ever!  Amen.23. But how I have been talking in order to stir you up never toesteem anything in this life!--as if you did not know this, or asif you were not resolved to leave everything, and had alreadydone it!  I see so much going wrong in the world, that though myspeaking of it is of no other use than to weary me by writing ofit, it is some relief to me that all I am saying makes againstmyself.  Our Lord forgive me all that I do amiss herein; and youtoo, my father, for wearying you to no purpose.  It seems as if Iwould make you do penance for my sins herein.1. Ch. xxv. § 20.2.

ISFJ	 XXVIII.Visions of the Sacred Humanity, and of the Glorified Bodies.Imaginary Visions.  Great Fruits Thereof When They Come from God.1. I now resume our subject.  I spent some days, not many, withthat vision [1] continually before me.  It did me so much good,that I never ceased to pray.  Even when I did cease, I contrivedthat it should be in such a way as that I should not displeaseHim whom I saw so clearly present, an eye-witness of my acts.And though I was occasionally afraid, because so much was said tome about delusions, that fear lasted not long, because our Lordreassured me.2. It pleased our Lord, one day that I was in prayer, to show meHis Hands, and His Hands only.  The beauty of them was so great,that no language can describe it.  This put me in great fear; foreverything that is strange, in the beginning of any new gracefrom God, makes me very much afraid.  A few days later, I saw Hisdivine Face, and I was utterly entranced.  I could not understandwhy our Lord showed Himself in this way, seeing that, afterwards,He granted me the grace of seeing His whole Person.  Later on, Iunderstood that His Majesty was dealing with me according to theweakness of my nature.  May He be blessed for ever!  A glory sogreat was more than one so base and wicked could bear; and ourmerciful Lord, knowing this, ordered it in this way.3. You will think, my father, that it required no great courageto look upon Hands and Face so beautiful.  But so beautiful areglorified bodies, that the glory which surrounds them rendersthose who see that which is so supernatural and beautiful besidethemselves.  It was so with me: I was in such great fear,trouble, and perplexity at the sight.  Afterwards there ensued asense of safety and certainty, together with other results, sothat all fear passed immediately away. [2]4. On one of the feasts of St. Paul, [3] when I was at Mass,there stood before me the most Sacred Humanity, [4] as paintersrepresent Him after the resurrection, in great beauty andmajesty, as I particularly described it to you, my father, whenyou had insisted on it.  It was painful enough to have to writeabout it, for I could not describe it without doing greatviolence to myself.  But I described it as well as I could, andthere is no reason why I should now recur to it.  One thing,however, I have to say: if in heaven itself there were nothingelse to delight our eyes but the great beauty of glorifiedbodies, that would be an excessive bliss, particularly the visionof the Humanity of Jesus Christ our Lord.  If here below, whereHis Majesty shows Himself to us according to the measure whichour wretchedness can bear, it is so great, what must it be there,where the fruition of it is complete!5. This vision, though imaginary, I never saw with my bodilyeyes, nor, indeed, any other, but only with the eyes of the soul.Those who understand these things better than I do, say that theintellectual vision is more perfect than this; and this, theimaginary vision, much more perfect than those visions which areseen by the bodily eyes.  The latter kind of visions, they say,is the lowest; and it is by these that the devil can most deludeus. [5]  I did not know it then; for I wished, when this gracehad been granted me, that it had been so in such a way that Icould see it with my bodily eyes, in order that my confessormight not say to me that I indulged in fancies.6. After the vision was over, it happened that I tooimagined--the thought came at once--I had fancied these things;so I was distressed, because I had spoken of them to myconfessor, thinking that I might have been deceiving him.There was another lamentation: I went to my confessor, and toldhim of my doubts. He would ask me whether I told him the truth sofar as I knew it; or, if not, had I intended to deceive him?I would reply, that I told the truth; for, to the best of mybelief, I did not lie, nor did I mean anything of the kind;neither would I tell a lie for the whole world. [6]  This he knewwell enough; and, accordingly, he contrived to quiet me; and Ifelt so much the going to him with these doubts, that I cannottell how Satan could have put it into my head that I inventedthose things for the purpose of tormenting myself.7. But our Lord made such haste to bestow this grace upon me, andto declare the reality of it, that all doubts of the vision beinga fancy on my part were quickly taken away, and ever since I seemost clearly how silly I was.  For if I were to spend many yearsin devising how to picture to myself anything so beautiful, Ishould never be able, nor even know how, to do it for it isbeyond the reach of any possible imagination here below: thewhiteness and brilliancy alone are inconceivable.  It is not abrilliancy which dazzles, but a delicate whiteness and abrilliancy infused, furnishing the most excessive delight to theeyes, never wearied thereby, nor by the visible brightness whichenables us to see a beauty so divine.  It is a light so differentfrom any light here below, that the very brightness of the sun wesee, in comparison with the brightness and light before our eyes,seems to be something so obscure, that no one would ever wish toopen his eyes again.8. It is like most pellucid water running in a bed of crystal,reflecting the rays of the sun, compared with most muddy water ona cloudy day, flowing on the surface of the earth.  Not thatthere is anything like the sun present here, nor is the lightlike that of the sun: this light seems to be natural; and, incomparison with it, every other light is something artificial.It is a light which knows no night; but rather, as it is alwayslight, nothing ever disturbs it.  In short, it is such that noman, however gifted he may be, can ever, in the whole course ofhis life, arrive at any imagination of what it is.  God puts itbefore us so instantaneously, that we could not open our eyes intime to see it, if it were necessary for us to open them at all.But whether our eyes be open or shut, it makes no differencewhatever; for when our Lord wills, we must see it, whether wewill or not.  No distraction can shut it out, no power can resistit, nor can we attain to it by any diligence or efforts of ourown.  I know this by experience well, as I shall show you.9. That which I wish now to speak of is the manner in which ourLord manifests Himself in these visions.  I do not mean that I amgoing to explain how it is that a light so strong can enter theinterior sense, or so distinct an image the understanding, so asto seem to be really there; for this must be work for learnedmen.  Our Lord has not been pleased to let me understand how itis.  I am so ignorant myself, and so dull of understanding, that,although people have very much wished to explain it to me, I havenever been able to understand how it can be.10. This is the truth: though you, my father, may think that Ihave a quick understanding, it is not so; for I have found out,in many ways, that my understanding can take in only, as theysay, what is given to it to eat.  Sometimes my confessor used tobe amazed at my ignorance: and he never explained to me--nor,indeed, did I desire to understand--how God did this, nor how itcould be.  Nor did I ever ask; though, as I have said, [7] I hadconverse for many years with men of great learning.  But I didask them if this or that were a sin or not: as for everythingelse, the thought that God did it all was enough for me.  I sawthere was no reason to be afraid, but great reason to praise Him.On the other hand, difficulties increase my devotion; and thegreater the difficulty the greater the increase.11. I will therefore relate what my experience has shown me; buthow our Lord brought it about, you, my father, will explainbetter than I can, and make clear all that is obscure, and beyondmy skill to explain.  Now and then it seemed to me that what Isaw was an image; but most frequently it was not so.  I thoughtit was Christ Himself, judging by the brightness in which He waspleased to show Himself.  Sometimes the vision was so indistinct,that I thought it was an image; but still not like a picture,however well painted--and I have seen many good pictures.It would be absurd to suppose that the one bears any resemblancewhatever to the other, for they differ as a living person differsfrom his portrait, which, however well drawn, cannot be lifelike,for it is plain that it is a dead thing.  But let this pass,though to the purpose, and literally true.12. I do not say this by way of comparison, for comparisons arenever exact, but because it is the truth itself, as there is thesame difference here that there is between a living subject andthe portrait thereof, neither more nor less: for if what I sawwas an image, it was a living image,--not a dead man, but theliving Christ: and He makes me see that He is God and man,--notas He was in the sepulchre, but as He was when He had gone forthfrom it, risen from the dead.  He comes at times in majesty sogreat, that no one can have any doubt that it is our LordHimself, especially after Communion: we know that He is thenpresent, for faith says so.  He shows Himself so clearly to bethe Lord of that little dwelling-place, that the soul seems to bedissolved and lost in Christ.  O my Jesus, who can describe themajesty wherein Thou showest Thyself!  How utterly Thou art theLord of the whole world, and of heaven, and of a thousand otherand innumerable worlds and heavens, the creation of which ispossible to Thee!  The soul understands by that majesty whereinThou showest Thyself that it is nothing for Thee to be Lord ofall this.13. Here it is plain, O my Jesus, how slight is the power of allthe devils in comparison with Thine, and how he who is pleasingunto Thee is able to tread all hell under his feet.  Here we seewhy the devils trembled when Thou didst go down to Limbus, andwhy they might have longed for a thousand hells still lower, thatthey might escape from Thy terrible Majesty.  I see that it isThy will the soul should feel the greatness of Thy Majesty, andthe power of Thy most Sacred Humanity, united with Thy Divinity.Here, too, we see what the day of judgment will be, when we shallbehold the King in His Majesty, and in the rigour of His justiceagainst the wicked.  Here we learn true humility, imprinted inthe soul by the sight of its own wretchedness, of which now itcannot be ignorant.  Here, also, is confusion of face, and truerepentance for sins; for though the soul sees that our Lord showshow He loves it, yet it knows not where to go, and so isutterly dissolved.14. My meaning is, that so exceedingly great is the power of thisvision, when our Lord shows the soul much of His grandeur andmajesty, that it is impossible, in my opinion, for any soul toendure it, if our Lord did not succour it in a most supernaturalway, by throwing it into a trance or ecstasy, whereby the visionof the divine presence is lost in the fruition thereof.  It istrue that afterwards the vision is forgotten; but there remainsso deep an impression of the majesty and beauty of God, that itis impossible to forget it, except when our Lord is pleased thatthe soul should suffer from aridity and desolation, of which Ishall speak hereafter; [8] for then it seems to forget GodHimself.  The soul is itself no longer, it is always inebriated;it seems as if a living love of God, of the highest kind, made anew beginning within it; for though the former vision, which Isaid represented God without any likeness of Him, [9] is of ahigher kind, yet because of our weakness, in order that theremembrance of the vision may last, and that our thoughts may bewell occupied, it is a great matter that a presence so divineshould remain and abide in our imagination. These two kinds ofvisions come almost always together, and they do so come; for webehold the excellency and beauty and glory of the most HolyHumanity with the eyes of the soul.  And in the other way I havespoken of,--that of intellectual vision,--we learn how He is God,is mighty, can do all things, commands all things, governs allthings, and fills all things with His love.15. This vision is to be esteemed very highly; nor is there, inmy opinion, any risk in it, because the fruits of it show thatthe devil has no power here.  I think he tried three or fourtimes to represent our Lord to me, in this way, by a false imageof Him.  He takes the appearance of flesh, but he cannotcounterfeit the glory which it has when the vision is from God.Satan makes his representations in order to undo the true visionwhich the soul has had: but the soul resists instinctively; istroubled, disgusted, and restless; it loses that devotion and joyit previously had, and cannot pray at all.  In the beginning, itso happened to me three or four times.  These satanic visions arevery different things; and even he who shall have attained to theprayer of quiet only will, I believe, detect them by thoseresults of them which I described when I was speaking oflocutions. [10]  They are most easily recognised; and if a soulconsents not to its own delusion, I do not think that Satan willbe able to deceive it, provided it walks in humility andsingleness of heart.  He who shall have had the true vision,coming from God, detects the false visions at once; for, thoughthey begin with a certain sweetness and joy, the soul rejectsthem of itself; and the joy which Satan ministers must be, Ithink, very different--it shows no traces of pure and holy love:Satan very quickly betrays himself.16. Thus, then, as I believe, Satan can do no harm to anyone whohas had experience of these things; for it is the most impossibleof all impossible things that all this may be the work of theimagination.  There is no ground whatever for the supposition;for the very beauty and whiteness of one of our Lord's Hands [11]are beyond our imagination altogether.  How is it that we seepresent before us, in a moment, what we do not remember, what wehave never thought of, and, moreover, what, in a long space oftime, the imagination could not compass, because, as I have justsaid, [12] it far transcends anything we can comprehend in thislife?  This, then, is not possible.  Whether we have any power inthe matter or not will appear by what I am now going to say.17. If the vision were the work of a man's ownunderstanding,--setting aside that such a vision would notaccomplish the great results of the true one, nor, indeed, any atall,--it would be as the act of one who tries to go to sleep, andyet continues awake, because sleep has not come.  He longs forit, because of some necessity or weakness in his head: and so helulls himself to sleep, and makes efforts to procure it, and nowand then thinks he has succeeded; but, if the sleep be not real,it will not support him, nor supply strength to his head: on thecontrary, his head will very often be the worse for it.  So willit be here, in a measure; the soul will be dissipated, neithersustained nor strengthened; on the contrary, it will be weariedand disgusted.  But, in the true vision, the riches which abidein the soul cannot be described; even the body receives healthand comfort.18. I urged this argument, among others, when they told me thatmy visions came from the evil one, and that I imagined themmyself,--and it was very often,--and made use of certainillustrations, as well as I could, and as our Lord suggested tome.  But all was to little purpose; for as there were most holypersons in the place,--in comparison with whom I was a mass ofperdition,--whom God did not lead by this way, they were at oncefilled with fear; they thought it all came through my sins.And so my state was talked about, and came to the knowledge ofmany; though I had spoken of it to no one, except my confessor,or to those to whom he commanded [13] me to speak of it.19. I said to them once, If they who thus speak of my state wereto tell me that a person with whom I had just conversed, and whomI knew well, was not that person, but that I was deluding myself,and that they knew it, I should certainly trust them rather thanmy own eyes.  But if that person left with me certainjewels,--and if, possessing none previously, I held the jewels inmy hand as pledges of a great love,--and if I were now rich,instead of poor as before,--I should not be able to believe thisthat they said, though I might wish it.  These jewels I could nowshow them, for all who knew me saw clearly that my soul waschanged,--and so my confessor said; for the difference was verygreat in every way--not a pretence, but such as all might mostclearly observe.  As I was formerly so wicked, I said, I couldnot believe that Satan, if he wished to deceive me and take medown to hell, would have recourse to means so adverse to hispurpose as this, of rooting out my faults, implanting virtues andspiritual strength; for I saw clearly that I had become at onceanother person through the instrumentality of these visions.20. My confessor, who was, as I said before, [14] one of thefathers of the Society of Jesus, and a really holy man, answeredthem in the same way,--so I learnt afterwards.  He was a mostdiscreet man, and of great humility; but this great humility ofhis brought me into serious trouble: for, though he was a manmuch given to prayer, and learned, he never trusted his ownjudgment, because our Lord was not leading him by this way.He had, therefore, much to suffer on my account, in many ways.I knew they used to say to him that he must be on his guardagainst me, lest Satan should delude him through a belief inanything I might say to him.  They gave instances of others whowere deluded. [15]  All this distressed me.  I began to be afraidI should find no one to hear my confession, [16] and that allwould avoid me.  I did nothing but weep.21. It was a providence of God that he was willing to stand by meand hear my confession.  But he was so great a servant of God,that he would have exposed himself to anything for His sake.So he told me that if I did not offend God, nor swerve from theinstructions he gave me, there was no fear I should be desertedby him.  He encouraged me always, and quieted me.  He bade menever to conceal anything from him; and I never did. [17]He used to say that, so long as I did this, the devil, if it werethe devil, could not hurt me; on the contrary, out of that evilwhich Satan wished to do me, our Lord would bring forth good.He laboured with all his might to make me perfect.  As I was verymuch afraid myself, I obeyed him in everything, thoughimperfectly.  He had much to suffer on my account during threeyears of trouble and more, because he heard my confession allthat time; for in the great persecutions that fell upon me, andthe many harsh judgments of me which our Lord permitted,--many ofwhich I did not deserve,--everything was carried to him, and hewas found fault with because of me,--he being all the whileutterly blameless.22. If he had not been so holy a man, and if our Lord had notbeen with him, it would have, been impossible for him to bear somuch; for he had to answer those who regarded me as one going todestruction; and they would not believe what he said to them.On the other hand, he had to quiet me, and relieve me of myfears; when my fears increased, he had again to reassure me; for,after every vision which was strange to me, our Lord permitted meto remain in great fear.  All this was the result of my beingthen, and of having been, a sinner.  He used to console me out ofhis great compassion; and, if he had trusted to his ownconvictions, I should not have had so much to suffer; for Godrevealed the whole truth to him.  I believe that he received thislight from the Blessed Sacrament.23. Those servants of God who were not satisfied had manyconversations with me. [18]  As I spoke to them carelessly, sothey misunderstood my meaning in many things.  I had a greatregard for one of them; for my soul owed him more than I cantell.  He was a most holy man, and I felt it most acutely when Isaw that he did not understand me.  He had a great desire for myimprovement, and hoped our Lord would enlighten me.  So, then,because I spoke, as I was saying, without careful consideration,they looked upon me as deficient in humility; and when theydetected any of my faults--they might have detected many--theycondemned me at once.  They used to put certain questions to me,which I answered simply and carelessly.  Then they concludedforthwith that I wished to teach them, and that I consideredmyself to be a learned woman.  All this was carried to myconfessor,--for certainly they desired my amendment--and so hewould reprimand me.  This lasted some time, and I was distressedon many sides; but, with the graces which our Lord gave me, Ibore it all.24. I relate this in order that people may see what a great trialit is not to find any one who knows this way of the spirit byexperience.  If our Lord had not dealt so favourably with me, Iknow not what would have become of me.  There were some thingsthat were enough to take away my reason; and now and then I wasreduced to such straits that I could do nothing but lift up myeyes to our Lord. [19]  The contradiction of good people, which awretched woman, weak, wicked, and timid as I am, must bear with,seems to be nothing when thus described; but I, who in the courseof my life passed through very great trials, found this one ofthe heaviest. [20]25. May our Lord grant that I may have pleased His Majesty alittle herein; for I am sure that they pleased Him who condemnedand rebuked me, and that it was all for my great good.1.

ISFJ	 XXIX.Of Visions.  The Graces Our Lord Bestowed on the Saint.The Answers Our Lord Gave Her for Those Who Tried Her.1. I have wandered far from the subject; for I undertook togive reasons why the vision was no work of the imagination.For how can we, by any efforts of ours, picture to ourselves theHumanity of Christ, and imagine His great beauty?  No little timeis necessary, if our conception is in any way to resemble it.Certainly, the imagination may be able to picture it, and aperson may for a time contemplate that picture,--the form and thebrightness of it,--and gradually make it more perfect, and so layup that image in his memory.  Who can hinder this, seeing that itcould be fashioned by the understanding?  But as to the vision ofwhich I am speaking, there are no means of bringing it about;only we must behold it when our Lord is pleased to present itbefore us, as He wills and what He wills; and there is nopossibility of taking anything away from it, or of addinganything to it; nor is there any way of effecting it, whatever wemay do, nor of seeing it when we like, nor of abstaining fromseeing; if we try to gaze upon it--part of the vision inparticular--the vision of Christ is lost at once.2. For two years and a half God granted me this grace veryfrequently; but it is now more than three years since He hastaken away from me its continual presence, through another of ahigher nature, as I shall perhaps explain hereafter. [1]And though I saw Him speaking to me, and though I wascontemplating His great beauty, and the sweetness with whichthose words of His came forth from His divine mouth,--they weresometimes uttered with severity,--and though I was extremelydesirous to behold the colour of His eyes, or the form of them,so that I might be able to describe them, yet I never attained tothe sight of them, and I could do nothing for that end; on thecontrary, I lost the vision altogether.  And though I see that Helooks upon me at times with great tenderness, yet so strong isHis gaze, that my soul cannot endure it; I fall into a trance sodeep, that I lose the beautiful vision, in order to have agreater fruition of it all.3. Accordingly, willing or not willing, the vision hasnothing to do with it.  Our Lord clearly regards nothing buthumility and confusion of face, the acceptance of what He wishesto give, and the praise of Himself, the Giver.  This is true ofall visions without exception: we can contribute nothing towardsthem--we cannot add to them, nor can we take from them; our ownefforts can neither make nor unmake them.  Our Lord would have ussee most clearly that it is no work of ours, but of His DivineMajesty; we are therefore the less able to be proud of it: on thecontrary, it makes us humble and afraid; for we see that, as ourLord can take from us the power of seeing what we would see, soalso can He take from us these mercies and His grace, and we maybe lost for ever.  We must therefore walk in His fear while weare living in this our exile.4. Our Lord showed Himself to me almost always as He isafter His resurrection.  It was the same in the Host; only atthose times when I was in trouble, and when it was His will tostrengthen me, did He show His wounds.  Sometimes I saw Him onthe cross, in the Garden, crowned with thorns,--but that wasrarely; sometimes also carrying His cross because of mynecessities,--I may say so,--or those of others; but always inHis glorified body.  Many reproaches and many vexations have Iborne while telling this--many suspicions and much persecutionalso.  So certain were they to whom I spoke that I had an evilspirit, that some would have me exorcised.  I did not care muchfor this; but I felt it bitterly when I saw that my confessorswere afraid to hear me, or when I knew that they were told ofanything about me.5. Notwithstanding all this, I never could be sorry that Ihad had these heavenly visions; nor would I exchange even one ofthem for all the wealth and all the pleasures of the world.I always regarded them as a great mercy from our Lord; and to methey were the very greatest treasure,--of this our Lord assuredme often.  I used to go to Him to complain of all thesehardships; and I came away from prayer consoled, and with renewedstrength.  I did not dare to contradict those who were trying me;for I saw that it made matters worse, because they looked on mydoing so as a failure in humility.  I spoke of it to myconfessor; he always consoled me greatly when he saw mein distress.6. As my visions grew in frequency, one of those who used tohelp me before--it was to him I confessed when thefather-minister [2] could not hear me--began to say that I wascertainly under the influence of Satan.  He bade me, now that Ihad no power of resisting, always to make the sign of the crosswhen I had a vision, to point my finger at it by way ofscorn, [3] and be firmly persuaded of its diabolic nature.  If Idid this, the vision would not recur.  I was to be without fearon the point; God would watch over me, and take the visionaway. [4]  This was a great hardship for me; for, as I could notbelieve that the vision did not come from God, it was a fearfulthing for me to do; and I could not wish, as I said before, thatthe visions should be withheld.  However, I did at last as I wasbidden.  I prayed much to our Lord, that He would deliver me fromdelusions. I was always praying to that effect, and with manytears.  I had recourse also to St. Peter and St. Paul; for ourLord had said to me--it was on their feast that He had appearedto me the first time [5]--that they would preserve me fromdelusion.  I used to see them frequently most distinctly on myleft hand; but that vision was not imaginary.  These gloriousSaints were my very good lords.7. It was to me a most painful thing to make a show ofcontempt whenever I saw our Lord in a vision; for when I saw Himbefore me, if I were to be cut in pieces, I could not believe itwas Satan.  This was to me, therefore, a heavy kind of penance;and accordingly, that I might not be so continually crossingmyself, I used to hold a crucifix in my hand.  This I did almostalways; but I did not always make signs of contempt, because Ifelt that too much.  It reminded me of the insults which the Jewsheaped upon Him; and so I prayed Him to forgive me, seeing that Idid so in obedience to him who stood in His stead, and not to laythe blame on me, seeing that he was one of those whom He hadplaced as His ministers in His Church.  He said to me that I wasnot to distress myself--that I did well to obey; but He wouldmake them see the truth of the matter.  He seemed to me to beangry when they made me give up my prayer. [6]  He told me to sayto them that this was tyranny.  He gave me reasons for believingthat the vision was not satanic; some of them I mean to repeat byand by.8. On one occasion,when I was holding in my hand the crossof my rosary, He took it from me into His own hand.  He returnedit; but it was then four large stones incomparably more preciousthan diamonds; for nothing can be compared with what issupernatural.  Diamonds seem counterfeits and imperfect whencompared with these precious stones.  The five wounds weredelineated on them with most admirable art.  He said to me, thatfor the future that cross would appear so to me always; and so itdid.  I never saw the wood of which it was made, but only theprecious stones.  They were seen, however, by no one else,--onlyby myself. [7]9. When they had begun to insist on my putting my visions toa test like this, and resisting them, the graces I received weremultiplied more and more.  I tried to distract myself; I neverceased to be in prayer: even during sleep my prayer seemed to becontinual; for now my love grew, I made piteous complaints to ourLord, and told Him I could not bear it.  Neither was it in mypower--though I desired, and, more than that, even strove--togive up thinking of Him.  Nevertheless, I obeyed to the utmost ofmy power; but my power was little or nothing in the matter; andour Lord never released me from that obedience; but though Hebade me obey my confessor, He reassured me in another way, andtaught me what I was to say.  He has continued to do so untilnow; and He gave me reasons so sufficient, that I felt myselfperfectly safe.10. Not long afterwards His Majesty began, according to Hispromise, to make it clear that it was He Himself who appeared, bythe growth in me of the love of God so strong, that I knew notwho could have infused it; for it was most supernatural, and Ihad not attained to it by any efforts of my own.  I saw myselfdying with a desire to see God, and I knew not how to seek thatlife otherwise than by dying.  Certain great impetuosities [8] oflove, though not so intolerable as those of which I have spokenbefore, [9] nor yet of so great worth, overwhelmed me.  I knewnot what to do; for nothing gave me pleasure, and I had nocontrol over myself.  It seemed as if my soul were really tornaway from myself.  Oh, supreme artifice of our Lord! how tenderlydidst Thou deal with Thy miserable slave!  Thou didst hideThyself from me, and didst yet constrain me with Thy love, with adeath so sweet, that my soul would never wish it over.11. It is not possible for any one to understand theseimpetuosities if he has not experienced them himself.  They arenot an upheaving of the breast, nor those devotional sensations,not uncommon, which seem on the point of causing suffocation, andare beyond control.  That prayer is of a much lower order; andthose agitations should be avoided by gently endeavouring to berecollected; and the soul should be kept in quiet.  This prayeris like the sobbing of little children, who seem on the point ofchoking, and whose disordered senses are soothed by giving themto drink.  So here reason should draw in the reins, becausenature itself may be contributing to it and we should considerwith fear that all this may not be perfect, and that muchsensuality may be involved in it.  The infant soul should besoothed by the caresses of love, which shall draw forth its lovein a gentle way, and not, as they say, by force of blows.This love should be inwardly under control, and not as a caldron,fiercely boiling because too much fuel has been applied to it,and out of which everything is lost.  The source of the fire mustbe kept under control, and the flame must be quenched in sweettears, and not with those painful tears which come out of theseemotions, and which do so much harm.12. In the beginning, I had tears of this kind.  They leftme with a disordered head and a wearied spirit, and for a day ortwo afterwards unable to resume my prayer.  Great discretion,therefore, is necessary at first, in order that everything mayproceed gently, and that the operations of the spirit may bewithin; all outward manifestations should be carefully avoided.13. These other impetuosities are very different.  It is notwe who apply the fuel; the fire is already kindled, and we arethrown into it in a moment to be consumed.  It is by no effortsof the soul that it sorrows over the wound which the absence ofour Lord has inflicted on it; it is far otherwise; for an arrowis driven into the entrails to the very quick, [10] and into theheart at times, so that the soul knows not what is the matterwith it, nor what it wishes for.  It understands clearly enoughthat it wishes for God, and that the arrow seems tempered withsome herb which makes the soul hate itself for the love of ourLord, and willingly lose its life for Him.  It is impossible todescribe or explain the way in which God wounds the soul, nor thevery grievous pain inflicted, which deprives it of allself-consciousness; yet this pain is so sweet, that there is nojoy in the world which gives greater delight.  As I have justsaid, [11] the soul would wish to be always dying of this wound.14. This pain and bliss together carried me out of myself,and I never could understand how it was.  Oh, what a sight awounded soul is!--a soul, I mean, so conscious of it, as to beable to say of itself that it is wounded for so good a cause; andseeing distinctly that it never did anything whereby this loveshould come to it, and that it does come from that exceeding lovewhich our Lord bears it.  A spark seems to have fallen suddenlyupon it, that has set it all on fire.  Oh, how often do Iremember, when in this state, those words of David: 'Quemadmodumdesiderat cervus ad fontes aquarum'! [12] They seem to me to beliterally true of myself.15. When these impetuosities are not very violent they seemto admit of a little mitigation--at least, the soul seeks somerelief, because it knows not what to do--through certainpenances; the painfulness of which, and even the shedding of itsblood, are no more felt than if the body were dead.  The soulseeks for ways and means to do something that may be felt, forthe love of God; but the first pain is so great, that no bodilytorture I know of can take it away.  As relief is not to be hadhere, these medicines are too mean for so high a disease.Some slight mitigation may be had, and the pain may pass away alittle, by praying God to relieve its sufferings: but the soulsees no relief except in death, by which it thinks to attaincompletely to the fruition of its good.  At other times, theseimpetuosities are so violent, that the soul can do neither thisnor anything else; the whole body is contracted, and neither handnor foot can be moved: if the body be upright at the time, itfalls down, as a thing that has no control over itself.It cannot even breathe; all it does is to moan--not loudly,because it cannot: its moaning, however, comes from a keen senseof pain.16. Our Lord was pleased that I should have at times avision of this kind: I saw an angel close by me, on my left side,in bodily form.  This I am not accustomed to see, unless veryrarely.  Though I have visions of angels frequently, yet I seethem only by an intellectual vision, such as I have spoken ofbefore. [13]  It was our Lord's will that in this vision I shouldsee the angel in this wise.  He was not large, but small ofstature, and most beautiful--his face burning, as if he were oneof the highest angels, who seem to be all of fire: they must bethose whom we call cherubim. [14]  Their names they never tellme; but I see very well that there is in heaven so great adifference between one angel and another, and between these andthe others, that I cannot explain it.17. I saw in his hand a long spear of gold, and at theiron's point there seemed to be a little fire.  He appeared to meto be thrusting it at times into my heart, [15] and to pierce myvery entrails; when he drew it out, he seemed to draw them outalso, and to leave me all on fire with a great love of God.The pain was so great, that it made me moan; and yet sosurpassing was the sweetness of this excessive pain, that I couldnot wish to be rid of it.  The soul is satisfied now with nothingless than God.  The pain is not bodily, but spiritual; though thebody has its share in it, even a large one.  It is a caressing oflove so sweet which now takes place between the soul and God,that I pray God of His goodness to make him experience it who maythink that I am lying. [16]18. During the days that this lasted, I went about as ifbeside myself.  I wished to see, or speak with, no one, but onlyto cherish my pain, which was to me a greater bliss than allcreated things could give me. [17]19. I was in this state from time to time, whenever it wasour Lord's pleasure to throw me into those deep trances, which Icould not prevent even when I was in the company of others, andwhich, to my deep vexation, came to be publicly known.Since then, I do not feel that pain so much, but only that whichI spoke of before,--I do not remember the chapter, [18]--which isin many ways very different from it, and of greater worth.On the other hand, when this pain, of which I am now speaking,begins, our Lord seems to lay hold of the soul, and to throw itinto a trance, so that there is no time for me to have any senseof pain or suffering, because fruition ensues at once.  May He beblessed for ever, who hath bestowed such great graces on one whohas responded so ill to blessings so great!1. Ch. xl.2.

ISFJ	 XXX.St. Peter of Alcantara Comforts the Saint.  Great Temptations andInterior Trials.1. When I saw that I was able to do little or nothing towardsavoiding these great impetuosities, I began also to be afraid ofthem, because I could not understand how this pain and joy couldsubsist together.  I knew it was possible enough for bodily painand spiritual joy to dwell together; but the coexistence of aspiritual pain so excessive as this, and of joy so deep, troubledmy understanding.  Still, I tried to continue my resistance; butI was so little able, that I was now and then wearied.  I used totake up the cross for protection, and try to defend myselfagainst Him who, by the cross, is the Protector of us all.  I sawthat no one understood me.  I saw it very clearly myself, but Idid not dare to say so to any one except my confessor; for thatwould have been a real admission that I had no humility.2. Our Lord was pleased to succour me in a great measure,--and,for the moment, altogether,--by bringing to the place where I wasthat blessed friar, Peter of Alcantara.  Of him I spoke before,and said something of his penance. [1]  Among other things, Ihave been assured that he wore continually, for twenty years, agirdle made of iron. [2]  He is the author of certain littlebooks, in Spanish, on prayer, which are now in common use; for,as he was much exercised therein, his writings are veryprofitable to those who are given to prayer.  He kept the firstrule of the blessed St. Francis in all its rigour, and did thosethings besides of which I spoke before.3. When that widow, the servant of God and my friend, of whom Ihave already spoken, [3] knew that so great a man had come, shetook her measures.  She knew the straits I was in, for she was aneye-witness of my afflictions, and was a great comfort to me.Her faith was so strong, that she could not help believing thatwhat others said was the work of the devil was really the work ofthe Spirit of God; and as she is a person of great sense andgreat caution, and one to whom our Lord is very bountiful inprayer, it pleased His Majesty to let her see what learned menfailed to discern.  My confessors gave me leave to accept reliefin some things from her, because in many ways she was able toafford it.  Some of those graces which our Lord bestowed on mefell to her lot occasionally, together with instructions mostprofitable for her soul.  So, then, when she knew that theblessed man was come, without saying a word to me, she obtainedleave from the Provincial for me to stay eight days in her house,in order that I might the more easily confer with him.  In thathouse, and in one church or another, I had many conversationswith him the first time he came here; for, afterwards, I had manycommunications with him at diverse times.4. I gave him an account, as briefly as I could, of my life, andof my way of prayer, with the utmost clearness in my power.I have always held to this, to be perfectly frank and exact withthose to whom I make known the state of my soul. [4]  Even myfirst impulses I wish them to know; and as for doubtful andsuspicious matters, I used to make the most of them by arguingagainst myself.  Thus, then, without equivocation or concealment,I laid before him the state of my soul.  I saw almost at oncethat he understood me, by reason of his own experience.  That wasall I required; for at that time I did not know myself as I donow,so as to give an account of my state.  It was at a later timethat God enabled me to understand myself, and describe the graceswhich His Majesty bestows upon me.  It was necessary, then, thathe who would clearly understand and explain my state should havehad experience of it himself.5. The light he threw on the matter was of the clearest; for asto these visions, at least, which were not imaginary, I could notunderstand how they could be.  And it seemed that I could notunderstand, too, how those could be which I saw with the eyes ofthe soul; for, as I said before, [5] those visions only seemed tome to be of consequence which were seen with the bodily eyes: andof these I had none.  The holy man enlightened me on the wholequestion, explained it to me, and bade me not to be distressed,but to praise God, and to abide in the full conviction that thiswas the work of the Spirit of God; for, saving the faith, nothingcould be more true, and there was nothing on which I could morefirmly rely.  He was greatly comforted in me, was most kind andserviceable, and ever afterwards took great care of me, and toldme of his own affairs and labours; and when he saw that I hadthose very desires which in himself were fulfilled already,--forour Lord had given me very strong desires,--and also how great myresolution was, he delighted in conversing with me.6. To a person whom our Lord has raised to this state, there isno pleasure or comfort equal to that of meeting with another whomour Lord has begun to raise in the same way.  At that time,however, it must have been only a beginning with me, as Ibelieve; and God grant I may not have gone back now.  He wasextremely sorry for me.  He told me that one of the greatesttrials in this world was that which I had borne,--namely, thecontradiction of good people, [6]--and that more was in reservefor me: I had need, therefore, of some one--and there was no onein this city--who understood me; but he would speak to myconfessor, and to that married nobleman, already spoken of, [7]who was one of those who tormented me most, and who, because ofhis great affection for me, was the cause of all these attacks.He was a holy but timid man, and could not feel safe about me,because he had seen how wicked I was, and that not long before.The holy man did so; he spoke to them both, explained the matter,and gave them reasons why they should reassure themselves, anddisturb me no more.  My confessor was easily satisfied,--not sothe nobleman; for though they were not enough to keep him quiet,yet they kept him in some measure from frightening me so much ashe used to do.7. We made an agreement that I should write to him and tell himhow it fared with me, for the future, and that we should praymuch for each other.  Such was his humility, that he held to theprayers of a wretch like me.  It made me very much ashamed ofmyself.  He left me in the greatest consolation and joy, biddingme continue my prayer with confidence, and without any doubt thatit was the work of God.  If I should have any doubts, for mygreater security, I was to make them known to my confessor, and,having done so, be in peace.  Nevertheless, I was not able at allto feel that confidence, for our Lord was leading me by the wayof fear; and so, when they told me that the devil had power overme, I believed them.  Thus, then, not one of them was able toinspire me with confidence on the one hand, or fear on the other,in such a way as to make me believe either of them, otherwisethan as our Lord allowed me.  Accordingly, though the holy friarconsoled and calmed me, I did not rely so much on him as to bealtogether without fear, particularly when our Lord forsook me inthe afflictions of my soul, of which I will now speak.Nevertheless, as I have said, I was very much consoled.8. I could not give thanks enough to God, and to my gloriousfather St. Joseph, who seemed to me to have brought him here.He was the commissary-general of the custody [8] of St. Joseph,to whom, and to our Lady, I used to pray much.9. I suffered at times--and even still, though not so often--themost grievous trials, together with bodily pains and afflictionsarising from violent sicknesses; so much so, that I couldscarcely control myself.  At other times, my bodily sickness wasmore grievous; and as I had no spiritual pain, I bore it withgreat joy: but, when both pains came upon me together, mydistress was so heavy, that I was reduced to sore straits.10. I forgot all the mercies our Lord had shown me, andremembered them only as a dream, to my great distress; for myunderstanding was so dull, that I had a thousand doubts andsuspicions whether I had ever understood matters aright, thinkingthat perhaps all was fancy, and that it was enough for me to havedeceived myself, without also deceiving good men.  I looked uponmyself as so wicked as to have been the cause, by my sins, of allthe evils and all the heresies that had sprung up.  This is but afalse humility, and Satan invented it for the purpose ofdisquieting me, and trying whether he could thereby drive my soulto despair.  I have now had so much experience, that I know thiswas his work; so he, seeing that I understand him, does nottorment me in the same way as much as he used to do.  That it ishis work is clear from the restlessness and discomfort with whichit begins, and the trouble it causes in the soul while it lasts;from the obscurity and distress, the aridity and indispositionfor prayer and for every good work, which it produces.  It seemsto stifle the soul and trammel the body, so as to make them goodfor nothing.11. Now, though the soul acknowledges itself to be miserable, andthough it is painful to us to see ourselves as we are, and thoughwe have most deep convictions of our own wickedness,--deep asthose spoken of just now, [9] and really felt,--yet true humilityis not attended with trouble; it does not disturb the soul; itcauses neither obscurity nor aridity: on the contrary, itconsoles.  It is altogether different, bringing with it calm,sweetness, and light.  It is no doubt painful; but, on the otherhand, it is consoling, because we see how great is the mercy ofour Lord in allowing the soul to have that pain, and how well thesoul is occupied.  On the one hand, the soul grieves over itsoffences against God; on the other, His compassion makes it glad.It has light, which makes it ashamed of itself; and it givesthanks to His Majesty, who has borne with it so long.  That otherhumility, which is the work of Satan, furnishes no light for anygood work; it pictures God as bringing upon everything fire andsword; it dwells upon His justice; and the soul's faith in themercy of God--for the power of the devil does not reach so far asto destroy faith--is of such a nature as to give me noconsolation: on the contrary, the consideration of mercies sogreat helps to increase the pain, because I look upon myself asbound to render greater service.12. This invention of Satan is one of the most painful, subtle,and crafty that I have known him to possess; I should thereforelike to warn you, my father, of it, in order that, if Satanshould tempt you herein, you may have some light, and be aware ofhis devices, if your understanding should be left at liberty:because you must not suppose that learning and knowledge are ofany use here; for though I have none of them myself, yet now thatI have escaped out of his hands I see clearly that this is folly.What I understood by it is this: that it is our Lord's pleasureto give him leave and license, as He gave him of old to temptJob; [10] though in my case, because of my wretchedness, thetemptation is not so sharp.13. It happened to me to be tempted once in this way; and Iremember it was on the day before the vigil of Corpus Christi,--afeast to which I have great devotion, though not so great as Iought to have.  The trial then lasted only till the day of thefeast itself.  But, on other occasions, it continued one, two,and even three weeks and--I know not--perhaps longer.  But I wasspecially liable to it during the Holy Weeks, when it was myhabit to make prayer my joy.  Then the devil seizes on myunderstanding in a moment; and occasionally, by means of thingsso trivial that I should laugh at them at any other time, hemakes it stumble over anything he likes.  The soul, laid infetters, loses all control over itself, and all power of thinkingof anything but the absurdities he puts before it, which, beingmore or less unsubstantial, inconsistent, and disconnected, serveonly to stifle the soul, so that it has no power over itself; andaccordingly--so it seems to me--the devils make a football of it,and the soul is unable to escape out of their hands.  It isimpossible to describe the sufferings of the soul in this state.It goes about in quest of relief, and God suffers it to findnone.  The light of reason, in the freedom of its will, remains,but it is not clear; it seems to me as if its eyes were coveredwith a veil.  As a person who, having travelled often by aparticular road, knows, though it be night and dark, by his pastexperience of it, where he may stumble, and where he ought to beon his guard against that risk, because he has seen the place byday, so the soul avoids offending God: it seems to go on byhabit--that is, if we put out of sight the fact that our Lordholds it by the hand, which is the true explanation ofthe matter.14. Faith is then as dead, and asleep, like all the othervirtues; not lost, however,--for the soul truly believes all thatthe church holds; but its profession of the faith is hardly morethan an outward profession of the mouth.  And, on the other hand,temptations seem to press it down, and make it dull, so that itsknowledge of God becomes to it as that of something which ithears of far away.  So tepid is its love that, when it hears Godspoken of, it listens and believes that He is what He is, becausethe Church so teaches; but it recollects nothing of its ownformer experience.  Vocal prayer or solitude is only a greateraffliction, because the interior suffering--whence it comes, itknows not--is unendurable, and, as it seems to me, in somemeasure a counterpart of hell.  So it is, as our Lord showed mein a vision; [11] for the soul itself is then burning in thefire, knowing not who has kindled it, nor whence it comes, norhow to escape it, nor how to put it out: if it seeks relief fromthe fire by spiritual reading, it cannot find any, just as if itcould not read at all.  On one occasion, it occurred to me toread a life of a Saint, that I might forget myself, and berefreshed with the recital of what he had suffered.  Four or fivetimes, I read as many lines; and, though they were written inSpanish, I understood them less at the end than I did when Ibegan: so I gave it up.  It so happened to me on more occasionsthan one, but I have a more distinct recollection of this.15. To converse with any one is worse, for the devil then sendsso offensive a spirit of bad temper, that I think I could eatpeople up; nor can I help myself.  I feel that I do somethingwhen I keep myself under control; or rather our Lord does so,when He holds back with His hand any one in this state fromsaying or doing something that may be hurtful to his neighboursand offensive to God.  Then, as to going to our confessor, thatis of no use; for the certain result is--and very often has ithappened to me--what I shall now describe.  Though my confessors,with whom I had to do then, and have to do still, are so holy,they spoke to me and reproved me with such harshness, that theywere astonished at it afterwards when I told them of it.They said that they could not help themselves; for, though theyhad resolved not to use such language, and though they pitied mealso very much,--yea, even had scruples on the subject, becauseof my grievous trials of soul and body,--and were, moreover,determined to console me, they could not refrain.  They did notuse unbecoming words--I mean, words offensive to God; yet theirwords were the most offensive that could be borne with inconfession. They must have aimed at mortifying me.  At othertimes, I used to delight in this, and was prepared to bear it;but it was then a torment altogether.  I used to think, too, thatI deceived them; so I went to them, and cautioned them veryearnestly to be on their guard against me, for it might be that Ideceived them.  I saw well enough that I would not do soadvisedly, nor tell them an untruth; [12] but everything made meafraid.  One of them, on one occasion, when he had heard me speakof this temptation, told me not to distress myself; for, even ifI wished to deceive him, he had sense enough not to be deceived.This gave me great comfort.16. Sometimes, almost always,--at least, very frequently,--I usedto find rest after Communion; now and then, even, as I drew nearto the most Holy Sacrament, all at once my soul and body would beso well, that I was amazed. [13]  It seemed to be nothing else butan instantaneous dispersion of the darkness that covered my soul:when the sun rose, I saw how silly I had been.17. On other occasions, if our Lord spoke to me but one word,saying only, 'Be not distressed, have no fear,'--as I saidbefore, [14]--I was made whole at once; or, if I saw a vision, Iwas as if I had never been amiss.  I rejoiced in God, and made mycomplaint to Him, because He permitted me to undergo suchafflictions; yet the recompense was great; for almost always,afterwards, His mercies descended upon me in great abundance.The soul seemed to come forth as gold out of the crucible, mostrefined, and made glorious to behold, our Lord dwelling withinit.  These trials afterwards are light, though they once seemedto be unendurable; and the soul longs to undergo them again, ifthat be more pleasing to our Lord.  And though trials andpersecutions increase, yet, if we bear them without offending ourLord, rejoicing in suffering for His sake, it will be all thegreater gain: I, however, do not bear them as they ought to beborne, but rather in a most imperfect way.  At other times, mytrials came upon me--they come still--in another form; and thenit seems to me as if the very possibility of thinking a goodthought, or desiring the accomplishment of it, were utterly takenfrom me: both soul and body are altogether useless and a heavyburden.  However, when I am in this state, I do not suffer fromthe other temptations and disquietudes, but only from a certainloathing of I know not what, and my soul finds pleasurein nothing.18. I used to try exterior good works, in order to occupy myselfpartly by violence; and I know well how weak a soul is when graceis hiding itself.  It did not distress me much, because the sightof my own meanness gave me some satisfaction. On other occasions,I find myself unable to pray or to fix my thoughts with anydistinctness upon God, or anything that is good, though I may bealone; but I have a sense that I know Him. It is theunderstanding and the imagination, I believe, which hurt me here;for it seems to me that I have a good will, disposed for allgood; but the understanding is so lost, that it seems to benothing else but a raving lunatic, which nobody can restrain, andof which I am not mistress enough to keep it quiet fora minute. [15]19. Sometimes I laugh at myself, and recognise my wretchedness: Iwatch my understanding, and leave it alone to see what it willdo.  Glory be to God, for a wonder, it never runs on what iswrong, but only on indifferent things, considering what is goingon here, or there, or elsewhere.  I see then, more and more, theexceeding great mercy of our Lord to me, when He keeps thislunatic bound in the chains of perfect contemplation.  I wonderwhat would happen if those people who think I am good knew of myextravagance.  I am very sorry when I see my soul in such badcompany; I long to see it delivered therefrom, and so I say toour Lord: When, O my God, shall I see my whole soul praisingThee, that it may have the fruition of Thee in all its faculties?Let me be no longer, O Lord, thus torn to pieces, and every oneof them, as it were, running in a different direction.  This hasbeen often the case with me, but I think that my scanty bodilyhealth was now and then enough to bring it about.20. I dwell much on the harm which original sin has done us; thatis, I believe, what has rendered us incapable of the fruition ofso great a good.  My sins, too, must be in fault; for, if I hadnot committed so many, I should have been more perfect ingoodness.  Another great affliction which I suffered was this:all the books which I read on the subject of prayer, I thought Iunderstood thoroughly, and that I required them no longer,because our Lord had given me the gift of prayer.  I thereforeceased to read those books, and applied myself to lives ofSaints, thinking that this would improve me and give me courage;for I found myself very defective in every kind of service whichthe Saints rendered unto God.  Then it struck me that I had verylittle humility, when I could think that I had attained to thisdegree of prayer; and so, when I could not come to any otherconclusion, I was greatly distressed, until certain learnedpersons, and the blessed friar, Peter of Alcantara, told me notto trouble myself about the matter.21. I see clearly enough that I have not yet begun to serve God,though He showers down upon me those very graces which He givesto many good people.  I am a mass of imperfection, except indesire and in love; for herein I see well that our Lord has beengracious to me, in order that I may please Him in some measure.I really think that I love Him; but my conduct, and the manyimperfections I discern in myself, make me sad.22. My soul, also, is subject occasionally to a certainfoolishness,--that is the right name to give it,--when I seem tobe doing neither good nor evil, but following in the wake ofothers, as they say, without pain or pleasure, indifferent tolife and death, pleasure and pain.  I seem to have no feeling.The soul seems to me like a little ass, which feeds and thrives,because it accepts the food which is given it, and eats itwithout reflection.  The soul in this state must be feeding onsome great mercies of God, seeing that its miserable life is noburden to it, and that it bears it patiently but it is consciousof no sensible movements or results, whereby it may ascertain thestate it is in.23. It seems to me now like sailing with a very gentle wind, whenone makes much way without knowing how; for in the other states,so great are the effects, that the soul sees almost at once animprovement in itself, because the desires instantly are on fire,and the soul is never satisfied.  This comes from those greatimpetuosities of love, spoken of before, [16] in those to whomGod grants them.  It is like those little wells I have seenflowing, wherein the upheaving of the sand never ceases.This illustration and comparison seem to me to be a truedescription of those souls who attain to this state; their loveis ever active, thinking what it may do; it cannot containitself, as the water remains not in the earth, but is continuallywelling upwards.  So is the soul, in general; it is not at rest,nor can it contain itself, because of the love it has: it is sosaturated therewith, that it would have others drink of it,because there is more than enough for itself, in order that theymight help it to praise God.24. I call to remembrance--oh, how often!--that living water ofwhich our Lord spoke to the Samaritan woman.  That Gospel [17]has a great attraction for me; and, indeed, so it had even when Iwas a little child, though I did not understand it then as I donow. I used to pray much to our Lord for that living water; and Ihad always a picture of it, representing our Lord at the well,with this inscription, 'Domine, da mihi aquam.' [18]25. This love is also like a great fire, which requires fuelcontinually, in order that it may not burn out.  So those souls Iam speaking of, however much it may cost them, will always bringfuel, in order that the fire may not be quenched.  As for me, Ishould be glad, considering what I am, if I had but straw even tothrow upon it.  And so it is with me occasionally--and, indeed,very often.  At one time, I laugh at myself; and at another, I amvery much distressed.  The inward stirring of my love urges me todo something for the service of God; and I am not able to do morethan adorn images with boughs and flowers, clean or arrange anoratory, or some such trifling acts, so that I am ashamed ofmyself.  If I undertook any penitential practice, the whole wasso slight, and was done in such a way, that if our Lord did notaccept my good will, I saw it was all worthless, and so I laughedat myself.  The failure of bodily strength, sufficient to dosomething for God, is no light affliction for those souls to whomHe, in His goodness, has communicated this fire of His love inits fulness.  It is a very good penance; for when souls are notstrong enough to heap fuel on this fire, and die of fear that thefire may go out, it seems to me that they become fuel themselves,are reduced to ashes, or dissolved in tears, and burn away: andthis is suffering enough, though it be sweet.26. Let him, then, praise our Lord exceedingly, who has attainedto this state; who has received the bodily strength requisite forpenance; who has learning, ability, and power to preach, to hearconfessions, and to draw souls unto God.  Such a one neitherknows nor comprehends the blessing he possesses, unless he knowsby experience what it is to be powerless to serve God inanything, and at the same time to be receiving much from Him.May He be blessed for ever, and may the angels glorifyHim!  Amen.27. I know not if I do well to write so much in detail.  But asyou, my father, bade me again not to be troubled by theminuteness of my account, nor to omit anything, I go onrecounting clearly and truly all I can call to mind.  But I mustomit much; for if I did not, I should have to spend moretime--and, as I said before, [19] I have so little to spend, andperhaps, after all, nothing will be gained.1.

ISFJ	 XXXI.Of Certain Outward Temptations and Appearances of Satan.  Of theSufferings Thereby Occasioned.  Counsels for Those Who Go onUnto Perfection.1. Now that I have described certain temptations and troubles,interior and secret, of which Satan was the cause, I will speakof others which he wrought almost in public, and in which hispresence could not be ignored. [1]2. I was once in an oratory, when Satan, in an abominable shape,appeared on my left hand.  I looked at his mouth in particular,because he spoke, and it was horrible.  A huge flame seemed toissue out of his body, perfectly bright, without any shadow.He spoke in a fearful way, and said to me that, though I hadescaped out of his hands, he would yet lay hold of me again.I was in great terror, made the sign of the cross as well as Icould, and then the form vanished--but it reappeared instantly.This occurred twice; I did not know what to do; there was someholy water at hand; I took some, and threw it in the direction ofthe figure, and then Satan never returned.3. On another occasion, I was tortured for five hours with suchterrible pains, such inward and outward sufferings, that itseemed to me as if I could not bear them.  Those who were with mewere frightened; they knew not what to do, and I could not helpmyself.  I am in the habit, when these pains and my bodilysuffering are most unendurable, to make interior acts as well asI can, imploring our Lord, if it be His will, to give mepatience, and then to let me suffer on, even to the end of theworld.  So, when I found myself suffering so cruelly, I relievedmyself by making those acts and resolutions, in order that Imight be able to endure the pain.  It pleased our Lord to let meunderstand that it was the work of Satan; for I saw close besideme a most frightful little negro, gnashing his teeth in despairat losing what he attempted to seize.  When I saw him, I laughed,and had no fear; for there were some then present who werehelpless, and knew of no means whereby so great a pain could berelieved.  My body, head, and arms were violently shaken; I couldnot help myself: but the worst of all was the interior pain, forI could find no ease in any way.  Nor did I dare to ask for holywater, lest those who were with me should be afraid, and find outwhat the matter really was.4. I know by frequent experience that there is nothing which putsthe devils to flight like holy water.  They run away before thesign of the cross also, but they return immediately: great, then,must be the power of holy water.  As for me, my soul is consciousof a special and most distinct consolation whenever I take it.Indeed, I feel almost always a certain refreshing, which I cannotdescribe, together with an inward joy, which comforts my wholesoul.  This is no fancy, nor a thing which has occurred onceonly; for it has happened very often, and I have watched it verycarefully.  I may compare what I feel with that which happens toa person in great heat, and very thirsty, drinking a cup of coldwater--his whole being is refreshed.  I consider that everythingordained by the Church is very important; and I have a joy inreflecting that the words of the Church are so mighty, that theyendow water with power, so that there shall be so great adifference between holy water and water that has never beenblessed.  Then, as my pains did not cease, I told them, if theywould not laugh, I would ask for some holy water.  They broughtme some, and sprinkled me with it; but I was no better.  I thenthrew some myself in the direction of the negro, when he fled ina moment.  All my sufferings ceased, just as if some one hadtaken them from me with his hand; only I was wearied, as if I hadbeen beaten with many blows.  It was of great service to me tolearn that if, by our Lord's permission, Satan can do so muchevil to a soul and body not in his power, he can do much morewhen he has them in his possession.  It gave me a renewed desireto be delivered from a fellowship so dangerous.5. Another time, and not long ago, the same thing happened to me,though it did not last so long, and I was alone at the moment.I asked for holy water; and they who came in after the devil hadgone away,--they were two nuns, worthy of all credit, and wouldnot tell a lie for anything,--perceived a most offensive smell,like that of brimstone.  I smelt nothing myself; but the odourlasted long enough to become sensible to them.6. On another occasion, I was in choir, when, in a moment, Ibecame profoundly recollected.  I went out in order that thesisters might know nothing of it; yet those who were near heardthe sound of heavy blows where I was, and I heard voices myself,as of persons in consultation, but I did not hear what they said:I was so absorbed in prayer that I understood nothing, neitherwas I at all afraid.  This took place almost always when our Lordwas pleased that some soul or other, persuaded by me, advanced inthe spiritual life.  Certainly, what I am now about to describehappened to me once; there are witnesses to testify to it,particularly my present confessor, for he saw the account in aletter.  I did not tell him from whom the letter came, but heknew perfectly who the person was.7. There came to me a person who, for two years and a half, hadbeen living in mortal sin of the most abominable nature I everheard.  During the whole of that time, he neither confessed itnor ceased from it; and yet he said Mass.  He confessed his othersins but of this one he used to say, How can I confess so foul asin?  He wished to give it up, but he could not prevail onhimself to do so.  I was very sorry for him, and it was a greatgrief to me to see God offended in such a way.  I promised himthat I would pray to God for his amendment, and get others whowere better than I to do the same.  I wrote to one person, andthe priest undertook to get the letter delivered.  It came topass that he made a full confession at the first opportunity; forour Lord God was pleased, on account of the prayers of those mostholy persons to whom I had recommended him, to have pity on thissoul.  I, too, wretched as I am, did all I could for thesame end.8. He wrote to me, and said that he was so far improved, that hehad not for some days repeated his sin; but he was so tormentedby the temptation, that it seemed to him as if he were in hellalready, so great were his sufferings.  He asked me to pray toGod for him.  I recommended him to my sisters, through whoseprayers I must have obtained this mercy from our Lord; for theytook the matter greatly to heart; and he was a person whom no onecould find out.  I implored His Majesty to put an end to thesetorments and temptations, and to let the evil spirits torment meinstead, provided I did not offend our Lord.  Thus it was thatfor one month I was most grievously tormented; and then it wasthat these two assaults of Satan, of which I have just spoken,took place.9. Our Lord was pleased to deliver him out of this temptation, soI was informed; for I told him what happened to myself thatmonth.  His soul gained strength, and he continued free; he couldnever give thanks enough to our Lord and to me as if I had beenof any service--unless it be that the belief he had that our Lordgranted me such graces was of some advantage to him.  He saidthat, when he saw himself in great straits, he would read myletters, and then the temptation left him.  He was very muchastonished at my sufferings, and at the manner of his owndeliverance: even I myself am astonished, and I would suffer asmuch for many years for the deliverance of that soul.  May ourLord be praised for ever! for the prayers of those who serve Himcan do great things; and I believe the sisters of this house doserve Him.  The devils must have been more angry with me onlybecause I asked them to pray, and because our Lord permitted iton account of my sins.  At that time, too, I thought the evilspirits would have suffocated me one night, and when the sistersthrew much holy water about I saw a great troop of them rush awayas if tumbling over a precipice.  These cursed spirits havetormented me so often, and I am now so little afraid ofthem,--because I see they cannot stir without our Lord'spermission,--that I should weary both you, my father, andmyself, if I were to speak of these things in detail.10. May this I have written be of use to the true servant of God,who ought to despise these terrors, which Satan sends only tomake him afraid!  Let him understand that each time we despisethose terrors, their force is lessened, and the soul gains powerover them.  There is always some great good obtained; but I willnot speak of it, that I may not be too diffuse.  I will speak,however, of what happened to me once on the night of All Souls.I was in an oratory, and, having said one Nocturn, was sayingsome very devotional prayers at the end of our Breviary, whenSatan put himself on the book before me, to prevent my finishingmy prayer.  I made the sign of the cross, and he went away.I then returned to my prayer, and he, too, came back; he did so,I believe, three times, and I was not able to finish the prayerwithout throwing holy water at him.  I saw certain souls at thatmoment come forth out of purgatory--they must have been neartheir deliverance, and I thought that Satan might in this wayhave been trying to hinder their release.  It is very rarely thatI saw Satan assume a bodily form; I know of his presence throughthe vision I have spoken of before, [2] the vision wherein noform is seen.11. I wish also to relate what follows, for I was greatly alarmedat it: on Trinity Sunday, in the choir of a certain monastery,and in a trance, I saw a great fight between evil spirits and theangels.  I could not make out what the vision meant.  In lessthan a fortnight, it was explained clearly enough by the disputethat took place between persons given to prayer and many who werenot, which did great harm to that house; for it was a disputethat lasted long and caused much trouble.  On another occasion, Isaw a great multitude of evil spirits round about me, and, at thesame time, a great light, in which I was enveloped, which keptthem from coming near me.  I understood it to mean that God waswatching over me, that they might not approach me so as to makeme offend Him.  I knew the vision was real by what I sawoccasionally in myself.  The fact is, I know now how little powerthe evil spirits have, provided I am not out of the grace of God;I have scarcely any fear of them at all, for their strength is asnothing, if they do not find the souls they assail give up thecontest, and become cowards; it is in this case that they showtheir power.12. Now and then, during the temptations I am speaking of, itseemed to me as if all my vanity and weakness in times past hadbecome alive again within me; so I had reason enough to commitmyself into the hands of God.  Then I was tormented by thethought that, as these things came back to my memory, I must beutterly in the power of Satan, until my confessor consoled me;for I imagined that even the first movement towards an evilthought ought not to have come near one who had received from ourLord such great graces as I had.13. At other times, I was much tormented--and even now I amtormented--when I saw people make much of me, particularly greatpeople, and when they spake well of me.  I have suffered, andstill suffer, much in this way.  I think at once of the life ofChrist and of the Saints, and then my life seems the reverse oftheirs, for they received nothing but contempt and ill-treatment.All this makes me afraid; I dare not lift up my head, and I wishnobody saw me at all.  It is not thus with me when I ampersecuted; then my soul is so conscious of strength, though thebody suffers, and though I am in other ways afflicted, that I donot know how this can be; but so it is,--and my soul seems thento be a queen in its kingdom, having everything under its feet.14. I had such a thought now and then--and, indeed, for many daystogether.  I regarded it as a sign of virtue and of humility; butI see clearly now it was nothing else but a temptation.A Dominican friar, of great learning, showed it to me veryplainly. When I considered that the graces which our Lord hadbestowed upon me might come to the knowledge of the public, mysufferings became so excessive as greatly to disturb my soul.They went so far, that I made up my mind, while thinking of it,that I would rather be buried alive than have these things known.And so, when I began to be profoundly recollected, or to fallinto a trance, which I could not resist even in public, I was soashamed of myself, that I would not appear where people mightsee me.15. Once, when I was much distressed at this, our Lord said tome, What was I afraid of? one of two things must happen--peoplewould either speak ill of me, or give glory to Him.  He made meunderstand by this, that those who believed in the truth of whatwas going on in me would glorify Him; and that those who did notwould condemn me without cause: in both ways I should be thegainer, and I was therefore not to distress myself. [3]  Thismade me quite calm, and it comforts me whenever I think of it.16. This temptation became so excessive, that I wished to leavethe house, and take my dower to another monastery, whereenclosure was more strictly observed than in that wherein I wasat this time.  I had heard great things of that other house,which was of the same Order as mine; it was also at a greatdistance, and it would have been a great consolation to me tolive where I was not known; but my confessor would never let mego.  These fears deprived me in a great measure of all liberty ofspirit; and I understood afterwards that this was not truehumility, because it disturbed me so much.  And our Lord taughtme this truth; if I was convinced, and certainly persuaded, thatall that was good in me came wholly and only from God, and if itdid not distress me to hear the praises of others,--yea, rather,if I was pleased and comforted when I saw that God was working inthem,--then neither should I be distressed if He showed forth Hisworks in me.17. I fell, too, into another extreme.  I begged of God, and madeit a particular subject of prayer, that it might please HisMajesty, whenever any one saw any good in me, that such a onemight also become acquainted with my sins, in order that he mightsee that His graces were bestowed on me without any merit on mypart: and I always greatly desire this.  My confessor told me notto do it.  But almost to this day, if I saw that any one thoughtwell of me, I used in a roundabout way, or any how, as I could,to contrive he should know of my sins: [4] that seemed to relieveme.  But they have made me very scrupulous on this point.This, it appears to me, was not an effect of humility, butoftentimes the result of temptation.  It seemed to me that I wasdeceiving everybody--though, in truth, they deceived themselves,by thinking that there was any good in me. [5]  I did not wish todeceive them, nor did I ever attempt it, only our Lord permittedit for some end; and so, even with my confessors, I neverdiscussed any of these matters if I did not see the necessity ofit, for that would have occasioned very considerable scruples.18. All these little fears and distresses, and semblance ofhumility, I now see clearly were mere imperfections, and theresult of my unmortified life; for a soul left in the hands ofGod cares nothing about evil or good report, if it clearlycomprehends, when our Lord is pleased to bestow upon it Hisgrace, that it has nothing of its own.  Let it trust the Giver;it will know hereafter why He reveals His gifts, and prepareitself for persecution, which in these times is sure to come,when it is our Lord's will it should be known of any one that Hebestows upon him graces such as these; for a thousand eyes arewatching that soul, while a thousand souls of another order areobserved of none.  In truth, there was no little ground for fear,and that fear should have been mine: I was therefore not humble,but a coward; for a soul which God permits to be thus seen of menmay well prepare itself to be the world's martyr--because, if itwill not die to the world voluntarily, that very world willkill it.19. Certainly, I see nothing in the world that seems to me goodexcept this, that it tolerates no faults in good people, andhelps them to perfection by dint of complaints against them.I mean, that it requires greater courage in one not yet perfectto walk in the way of perfection than to undergo an instantmartyrdom; for perfection is not attained to at once, unless ourLord grant that grace by a special privilege: yet the world, whenit sees any one beginning to travel on that road, insists on hisbecoming perfect at once, and a thousand leagues off detects inhim a fault, which after all may be a virtue.  He who finds faultis doing the very same thing,--but, in his own case,viciously,--and he pronounces it to be so wrong in the other.He who aims at perfection, then, must neither eat norsleep,--nor, as they say, even breathe; and the more men respectsuch a one, the more do they forget that he is still in the body;and, though they may consider him perfect, he is living on theearth, subject to its miseries, however much he may tread themunder his feet. And so, as I have just said, great courage isnecessary here for, though the poor soul have not yet begun towalk, the world will have it fly; and, though its passions be notwholly overcome, men will have it that they must be underrestraint, even upon trying occasions, as those of the Saintsare, of whom they read, after they are confirmed in grace.20. All this is a reason for praising God, and also for greatsorrow of heart, because very many go backwards who, poor souls,know not how to help themselves; and I too, I believe, would havegone back also, if our Lord had not so mercifully on His partdone everything for me.  And until He, of His goodness, had doneall, nothing was done by me, as you, my father, may have seenalready, beyond falling and rising again.  I wish I knew how toexplain it, because many souls, I believe, delude themselves inthis matter; they would fly before God gives them wings.21. I believe I have made this comparison on anotheroccasion, [6] but it is to the purpose here, for I see certainsouls are very greatly afflicted on that ground.  When thesesouls begin, with great fervour, courage, and desire, to advancein virtue,--some of them, at least outwardly, giving up all forGod,--when they see in others, more advanced than themselves,greater fruits of virtue given them by our Lord,--for we cannotacquire these of ourselves,--when they see in all the bookswritten on prayer and on contemplation an account of what we haveto do in order to attain thereto, but which they cannotaccomplish themselves,--they lose heart.  For instance, they readthat we must not be troubled when men speak ill of us, that weare to be then more pleased than when they speak well of us; thatwe must despise our own good name, be detached from our kindred;avoid their company, which should be wearisome to us, unless theybe given to prayer; with many other things of the same kind.The disposition to practise this must be, in my opinion, the giftof God; for it seems to me a supernatural good, contrary to ournatural inclinations.  Let them not distress themselves; let themtrust in our Lord: what they now desire, His Majesty will enablethem to attain to by prayer, and by doing what they canthemselves; for it is very necessary for our weak nature that weshould have great confidence, that we should not be fainthearted,nor suppose that, if we do our best, we shall fail to obtain thevictory at last.  And as my experience here is large, I will say,by way of caution to you, my father, do not think--though it mayseem so--that a virtue is acquired when we have not tested it byits opposing vice: we must always be suspicious of ourselves, andnever negligent while we live; for much evil clings to us if, asI said before, [7] grace be not given to us fully to understandwhat everything is: and in this life there is nothing withoutgreat risks.22. I thought a few years ago, not only that I was detached frommy kindred, but that they were a burden to me; and certainly itwas so, for I could not endure their conversation.  An affair ofsome importance had to be settled, and I had to remain with asister of mine, for whom I had always before had a greataffection.  The conversation we had together, though she isbetter than I am, did not please me; for it could not always beon subjects I preferred, owing to the difference of ourconditions--she being married.  I was therefore as much alone asI could; yet I felt that her troubles gave me more trouble thandid those of my neighbours, and even some anxiety.  In short, Ifound out that I was not so detached as I thought, and that itwas necessary for me to flee from dangerous occasions, in orderthat the virtue which our Lord had begun to implant in me mightgrow; and so, by His help, I have striven to do from that timetill now.23. If our Lord bestows any virtue upon us, we must make much ofit, and by no means run the risk of losing it; so it is in thosethings which concern our good name, and many other matters.You, my father, must believe that we are not all of us detached,though we think we are; it is necessary for us never to becareless on this point.  If any one detects in himself anytenderness about his good name, and yet wishes to advance in thespiritual life, let him believe me and throw this embarrassmentbehind his back, for it is a chain which no file can sever; onlythe help of God, obtained by prayer and much striving on hispart, can do it.  It seems to me to be a hindrance on the road,and I am astonished at the harm it does.  I see some persons soholy in their works, and they are so great as to fill people withwonder.  O my God, why is their soul still on the earth?  Why hasit not arrived at the summit of perfection?  What does it mean?What keeps him back who does so much for God?  Oh, there itis!--self-respect! and the worst of it is, that these personswill not admit that they have it, merely because Satan now andthen convinces them that they are under an obligation toobserve it.24. Well, then, let them believe me: for the love of our Lord,let them give heed to the little ant, who speaks because it isHis pleasure.  If they take not this caterpillar away, though itdoes not hurt the whole tree, because some virtues remain, theworm will eat into every one of them.  Not only is the tree notbeautiful, but it also never thrives, neither does it suffer theothers near it to thrive; for the fruit of good example which itbears is not sound, and endures but a short time.  I say it againand again, let our self-respect be ever so slight, it will havethe same result as the missing of a note on the organ when it isplayed,--the whole music is out of tune.  It is a thing whichhurts the soul exceedingly in every way, but it is a pestilencein the way of prayer.25. Are we striving after union with God? and do we wish tofollow the counsels of Christ,--who was loaded with reproachesand falsely accused,--and, at the same time, to keep our ownreputation and credit untouched?  We cannot succeed, for thesethings are inconsistent one with another.  Our Lord comes to thesoul when we do violence to ourselves, and strive to give up ourrights in many things.  Some will say, I have nothing that I cangive up, nor have I any opportunity of doing so.  I believe thatour Lord will never suffer any one who has made so good aresolution as this to miss so great a blessing.  His Majesty willmake so many arrangements for him, whereby he may acquire thisvirtue,--more frequently, perhaps, than he will like.  Let himput his hand to the work.  I speak of the little nothings andtrifles which I gave up when I began--or, at least, of some ofthem: the straws which I said [8] I threw into the fire; for I amnot able to do more.  All this our Lord accepted: may He beblessed for evermore!26. One of my faults was this: I had a very imperfect knowledgeof my Breviary and of my duties in choir, simply because I wascareless and given to vanities; and I knew the other novicescould have taught me.  But I never asked them, that they mightnot know how little I knew.  It suggested itself to me at once,that I ought to set a good example: this is very common.Now, however, that God has opened my eyes a little, even when Iknow a thing, but yet am very slightly in doubt about it, I askthe children.  I have lost neither honour nor credit by it--onthe contrary, I believe our Lord has been pleased to strengthenmy memory.  My singing of the Office was bad, and I felt it muchif I had not learned the part intrusted to me,--not because Imade mistakes before our Lord, which would have been a virtue,but because I made them before the many nuns who heard me.  I wasso full of my own reputation, that I was disturbed, and thereforedid not sing what I had to sing even so well as I might havedone.  Afterwards, I ventured, when I did not know it very well,to say so.  At first, I felt it very much; but afterwards I foundpleasure in doing it.  So, when I began to be indifferent aboutits being known that I could not sing well, it gave me no pain atall, and I sang much better.  This miserable self-esteem tookfrom me the power of doing that which I regarded as an honour,for every one regards as honourable that which he likes.27. By trifles such as these, which are nothing,--and I amaltogether nothing myself, seeing that this gave me pain,--bylittle and little, doing such actions, and by such slightperformances,--they become of worth because done for God,--HisMajesty helps us on towards greater things; and so it happened tome in the matter of humility.  When I saw that all the nunsexcept myself were making great progress,--I was always myselfgood for nothing,--I used to fold up their mantles when they leftthe choir.  I looked on myself as doing service to angels who hadbeen there praising God.  I did so till they--I know nothow--found it out; and then I was not a little ashamed, becausemy virtue was not strong enough to bear that they should know ofit. But the shame arose, not because I was humble, but because Iwas afraid they would laugh at me, the matter being so trifling.28. O Lord, what a shame for me to lay bare so much wickedness,and to number these grains of sand, which yet I did not raise upfrom the ground in Thy service without mixing them with athousand meannesses!  The waters of Thy grace were not as yetflowing beneath them, so as to make them ascend upwards.  O myCreator, oh, that I had anything worth recounting amid so manyevil things, when I am recounting the great mercies I received atThy hands!  So it is, O my Lord.  I know not how my heart couldhave borne it, nor how any one who shall read this can helphaving me in abhorrence when he sees that mercies so great hadbeen so ill-requited, and that I have not been ashamed to speakof these services.  Ah! they are only mine, O my Lord; but I amashamed I have nothing else to say of myself; and that it is thatmakes me speak of these wretched beginnings, in order that he whohas begun more nobly may have hope that our Lord, who has mademuch of mine, will make more of his.  May it please His Majestyto give me this grace, that I may not remain for ever at thebeginning!  Amen. [9]1. 2 Cor. ii. 11: 'Non enim ignoramus cogitationes ejus.'2. Ch. xxvii. § 4.3.

ISFJ	 XXXII.Our Lord Shows St. Teresa the Place Which She Had by Her SinsDeserved in Hell.  The Torments There.  How the Monasteryof St. Joseph Was Founded.1. Some considerable time after our Lord had bestowed upon me thegraces I have been describing, and others also of a highernature, I was one day in prayer when I found myself in a moment,without knowing how, plunged apparently into hell.  I understoodthat it was our Lord's will I should see the place which thedevils kept in readiness for me, and which I had deserved by mysins.  It was but a moment, but it seems to me impossible Ishould ever forget it even if I were to live many years.2. The entrance seemed to be by a long narrow pass, like afurnace, very low, dark, and close.  The ground seemed to besaturated with water, mere mud, exceedingly foul, sending forthpestilential odours, and covered with loathsome vermin.  At theend was a hollow place in the wall, like a closet, and in that Isaw myself confined.  All this was even pleasant to behold incomparison with what I felt there.  There is no exaggeration inwhat I am saying.3. But as to what I then felt, I do not know where to begin, if Iwere to describe it; it is utterly inexplicable.  I felt a firein my soul.  I cannot see how it is possible to describe it.My bodily sufferings were unendurable.  I have undergone mostpainful sufferings in this life, and, as the physicians say, thegreatest that can be borne, such as the contraction of my sinewswhen I was paralysed, [1] without speaking of others of differentkinds, yea, even those of which I have also spoken, [2] inflictedon me by Satan; yet all these were as nothing in comparison withwhat I felt then, especially when I saw that there would be nointermission, nor any end to them.4. These sufferings were nothing in comparison with the anguishof my soul, a sense of oppression, of stifling, and of pain sokeen, accompanied by so hopeless and cruel an infliction, that Iknow not how to speak of it.  If I said that the soul iscontinually being torn from the body, it would be nothing, forthat implies the destruction of life by the hands of another buthere it is the soul itself that is tearing itself in pieces.I cannot describe that inward fire or that despair, surpassingall torments and all pain.  I did not see who it was thattormented me, but I felt myself on fire, and torn to pieces, asit seemed to me; and, I repeat it, this inward fire and despairare the greatest torments of all.5. Left in that pestilential place, and utterly without the powerto hope for comfort, I could neither sit nor lie down: there wasno room.  I was placed as it were in a hole in the wall; andthose walls, terrible to look on of themselves, hemmed me in onevery side.  I could not breathe.  There was no light, but allwas thick darkness.  I do not understand how it is; though therewas no light, yet everything that can give pain by being seenwas visible.6. Our Lord at that time would not let me see more of hell.Afterwards, I had another most fearful vision, in which I saw thepunishment of certain sins.  They were most horrible to look at;but, because I felt none of the pain, my terror was not so great.In the former vision, our Lord made me really feel thosetorments, and that anguish of spirit, just as if I had beensuffering them in the body there.  I know not how it was, but Iunderstood distinctly that it was a great mercy that our Lordwould have me see with mine own eyes the very place from whichHis compassion saved me.  I have listened to people speaking ofthese things, and I have at other times dwelt on the varioustorments of hell, though not often, because my soul made noprogress by the way of fear; and I have read of the diversetortures, and how the devils tear the flesh with red-hot pincers.But all is as nothing before this; it is a wholly differentmatter.  In short, the one is a reality, the other a picture; andall burning here in this life is as nothing in comparison withthe fire that is there.7. I was so terrified by that vision,--and that terror is on meeven now while I am writing,--that, though it took place nearlysix years ago, [3] the natural warmth of my body is chilled byfear even now when I think of it.  And so, amid all the pain andsuffering which I may have had to bear, I remember no time inwhich I do not think that all we have to suffer in this world isas nothing.  It seems to me that we complain without reason.I repeat it, this vision was one of the grandest mercies of ourLord.  It has been to me of the greatest service, because it hasdestroyed my fear of trouble and of the contradiction of theworld, and because it has made me strong enough to bear upagainst them, and to give thanks to our Lord, who has been myDeliverer, as it now seems to me, from such fearful andeverlasting pains.8. Ever since that time, as I was saying, everything seemsendurable in comparison with one instant of suffering such asthose I had then to bear in hell.  I am filled with fear when Isee that, after frequently reading books which describe in somemanner the pains of hell, I was not afraid of them, nor made anyaccount of them.  Where was I?  How could I possibly take anypleasure in those things which led me directly to so dreadful aplace?  Blessed for ever be Thou, O my God! and, oh, how manifestis it that Thou didst love me much more than I did love Thee!How often, O Lord, didst Thou save me from that fearful prison!and how I used to get back to it contrary to Thy will.9. It was that vision that filled me with the very great distresswhich I feel at the sight of so many lost souls,--especially ofthe Lutherans,--for they were once members of the Church bybaptism,--and also gave me the most vehement desires for thesalvation of souls; for certainly I believe that, to save evenone from those overwhelming torments, I would most willinglyendure many deaths.  If here on earth we see one whom wespecially love in great trouble or pain, our very nature seems tobid us compassionate him; and if those pains be great, we aretroubled ourselves.  What, then, must it be to see a soul indanger of pain, the most grievous of all pains, for ever?Who can endure it?  It is a thought no heart can bear withoutgreat anguish.  Here we know that pain ends with life at last,and that there are limits to it; yet the sight of it moves ourcompassion so greatly.  That other pain has no ending; and I knownot how we can be calm, when we see Satan carry so many soulsdaily away.10. This also makes me wish that, in a matter which concerns usso much, we did not rest satisfied with doing less than we can doon our part,--that we left nothing undone.  May our Lordvouchsafe to give us His grace for that end!  When I considerthat, notwithstanding my very great wickedness, I took some painsto please God, and abstained from certain things which I know theworld makes light of,--that, in short, I suffered grievousinfirmities, and with great patience, which our Lord gave me;that I was not inclined to murmur or to speak ill of anybody;that I could not--I believe so--wish harm to any one; that I wasnot, to the best of my recollection, either avaricious orenvious, so as to be grievously offensive in the sight of God;and that I was free from many other faults,--for, though sowicked, I had lived constantly in the fear of God,--I had to lookat the very place which the devils kept ready for me.  It is truethat, considering my faults, I had deserved a still heavierchastisement; but for all that, I repeat it, the torment wasfearful, and we run a great risk whenever we please ourselves.No soul should take either rest or pleasure that is liable tofall every moment into mortal sin.  Let us, then, for the love ofGod, avoid all occasions of sin, and our Lord will help us, as Hehas helped me.  May it please His Majesty never to let me out ofHis hands, lest I should turn back and fall, now that I have seenthe place where I must dwell if I do.  I entreat our Lord, forHis Majesty's sake, never to permit it.  Amen.11. When I had seen this vision, and had learned other great andhidden things which our Lord, of His goodness, was pleased toshow me,--namely, the joy of the blessed and the torment of thewicked,--I longed for the way and the means of doing penance forthe great evil I had done, and of meriting in some degree, sothat I might gain so great a good; and therefore I wished toavoid all society, and to withdraw myself utterly from the world.I was in spirit restless, yet my restlessness was not harassing,but rather pleasant.  I saw clearly that it was the work of God,and that His Majesty had furnished my soul with fervour, so thatI might be able to digest other and stronger food than I had beenaccustomed to eat.  I tried to think what I could do for God, andthought that the first thing was to follow my vocation to areligious life, which His Majesty had given me, by keeping myrule in the greatest perfection possible.12. Though in that house in which I then lived there were manyservants of God, and God was greatly served therein, yet, becauseit was very poor, the nuns left it very often and went to otherplaces, where, however, we could serve God in all honour andobservances of religion.  The rule also was kept, not in itsoriginal exactness, but according to the custom of the wholeOrder, authorised by the Bull of Mitigation.  There were otherinconveniences also: we had too many comforts, as it seemed tome; for the house was large and pleasant.  But this inconvenienceof going out, though it was I that took most advantage of it, wasa very grievous one for me; for many persons, to whom mysuperiors could not say no, were glad to have me with them.My superiors, thus importuned, commanded me to visit thesepersons; and thus it was so arranged that I could not be longtogether in the monastery.  Satan, too, must have had a share inthis, in order that I might not be in the house, where I was ofgreat service to those of my sisters to whom I continuallycommunicated the instructions which I received frommy confessors.13. It occurred once to a person with whom I was speaking to sayto me and the others that it was possible to find means for thefoundation of a monastery, if we were prepared to become nunslike those of the Barefooted Orders. [4]  I, having this desire,began to discuss the matter with that widowed lady who was mycompanion,--I have spoken of her before, [5]--and she had thesame wish that I had.  She began to consider how to provide arevenue for the home.  I see now that this was not the way,--onlythe wish we had to do so made us think it was; but I, on theother hand, seeing that I took the greatest delight in the housein which I was then living, because it was very pleasant to me,and, in my own cell, most convenient for my purpose, still heldback.  Nevertheless, we agreed to commit the matter with allearnestness to God.14. One day, after Communion, our Lord commanded me to labourwith all my might for this end.  He made me great promises,--thatthe monastery would be certainly built; that He would take greatdelight therein; that it should be called St. Joseph's; thatSt. Joseph would keep guard at one door, and our Lady at theother; that Christ would be in the midst of us; that themonastery would be a star shining in great splendour; that,though the religious Orders were then relaxed, I was not tosuppose that He was scantily served in them,--for what wouldbecome of the world, if there were no religious in it?--I was totell my confessor what He commanded me, and that He asked him notto oppose nor thwart me in the matter.15. So efficacious was the vision, and such was the nature of thewords our Lord spoke to me, that I could not possibly doubt thatthey came from Him.  I suffered most keenly, because I saw inpart the great anxieties and troubles that the work would costme, and I was also very happy in the house I was in then; andthough I used to speak of this matter in past times, yet it wasnot with resolution nor with any confidence that the thing couldever be done.  I saw that I was now in a great strait; and when Isaw that I was entering on a work of great anxiety, I hesitated;but our Lord spoke of it so often to me, and set before me somany reasons and motives, which I saw could not be gainsaid,--Isaw, too, that such was His will; so I did not dare do otherwisethan put the whole matter before my confessor, and give him anaccount in writing of all that took place.16. My confessor did not venture definitely to bid me abandon mypurpose; but he saw that naturally there was no way of carryingit out; because my friend, who was to do it, had very little orno means available for that end.  He told me to lay the matterbefore my superior, [6] and do what he might bid me do.  I neverspoke of my visions to my superior, but that lady who desired tofound the monastery communicated with him.  The Provincial wasvery much pleased, for he loves the whole Order, gave her everyhelp that was necessary, and promised to acknowledge the house.Then there was a discussion about the revenues of the monastery,and for many reasons we never would allow more than thirteensisters together.  Before we began our arrangements, we wrote tothe holy friar, Peter of Alcantara, telling him all that wastaking place; and he advised us not to abandon our work, and gaveus his sanction on all points.17. As soon as the affair began to be known here, there fell uponus a violent persecution, which cannot be very easilydescribed--sharp sayings and keen jests.  People said it wasfolly in me, who was so well off in my monastery; as to myfriend, the persecution was so continuous, that it wearied her.I did not know what to do, and I thought that people were partlyin the right.  When I was thus heavily afflicted, I commendedmyself to God, and His Majesty began to console and encourage me.He told me that I could then see what the Saints had to gothrough who founded the religious Orders: that I had much heavierpersecutions to endure than I could imagine, but I was not tomind them.  He told me also what I was to say to my friend; andwhat surprised me most was, that we were consoled at once as tothe past, and resolved to withstand everybody courageously.And so it came to pass; for among people of prayer, and indeed inthe whole neighbourhood, there was hardly one who was not againstus, and who did not think our work the greatest folly.18. There was so much talking and confusion in the very monasterywherein I was, that the Provincial began to think it hard for himto set himself against everybody; so he changed his mind, andwould not acknowledge the new house.  He said that the revenuewas not certain, and too little, while the opposition was great.On the whole, it seemed that he was right; he gave it up at last,and would have nothing to do with it.  It was a very great painto us,--for we seemed now to have received the first blow,--andin particular to me, to find the Provincial against us; for whenhe approved of the plan, I considered myself blameless beforeall.  They would not give absolution to my friend, if she did notabandon the project; for they said she was bound to removethe scandal.19. She went to a very learned man, and a very great servant ofGod, of the Order of St. Dominic, [7] to whom she gave an accountof all this matter.  This was even before the Provincial hadwithdrawn his consent; for in this place we had no one who wouldgive us advice; and so they said that it all proceeded solelyfrom our obstinacy.  That lady gave an account of everything, andtold the holy man how much she received from the property of herhusband.  Having, a great desire that he would help us,--for hewas the most learned man here, and there are few in his Ordermore learned than he,--I told him myself all we intended to do,and some of my motives.  I never said a word of any revelationwhatever, speaking only of the natural reasons which influencedme; for I would not have him give an opinion otherwise than onthose grounds.  He asked us to give him eight days before heanswered, and also if we had made up our minds to abide by whathe might say.  I said we had; but though I said so, and though Ithought so, I never lost a certain confidence that the monasterywould be founded.  My friend had more faith than I; nothing theycould say could make her give it up.  As for myself, though, as Isaid, it seemed to me impossible that the work should be finallyabandoned, yet my belief in the truth of the revelation went nofurther than in so far as it was not against what is contained inthe sacred writings, nor against the laws of the Church, which weare bound to keep.  Though the revelation seemed to me to havecome really from God, yet, if that learned man had told me thatwe could not go on without offending God and going against ourconscience, I believe I should have given it up, and looked outfor some other way; but our Lord showed me no other waythan this.20. The servant of God told me afterwards that he had made up hismind to insist on the abandonment of our project, for he hadalready heard the popular cry: moreover, he, as everybody did,thought it folly; and a certain nobleman also, as soon as he knewthat we had gone to him, had sent him word to consider well whathe was doing, and to give us no help; that when he began toconsider the answer he should make us, and to ponder on thematter, the object we had in view, our manner of life, and theOrder, he became convinced that it was greatly for the service ofGod, and that we must not give it up.  Accordingly, his answerwas that we should make haste to settle the matter.  He told ushow and in what way it was to be done; and if our means werescanty, we must trust somewhat in God.  If anyone made anyobjections, they were to go to him--he would answer them; and inthis way he always helped us, as I shall show by and by. [8]21. This answer was a great comfort to us; so also was theconduct of certain holy persons who were usually against us: theywere now pacified, and some of them even helped us.  One of themwas the saintly nobleman [9] of whom I spoke before; [10] helooked on it--so, indeed, it was--as a means of great perfection,because the whole foundation was laid in prayer.  He saw alsovery many difficulties before us, and no way out of them,--yet hegave up his own opinion, and admitted that the work might be ofGod.  Our Lord Himself must have touched his heart, as He alsodid that of the doctor, the priest and servant of God, to whom,as I said before, [11] I first spoke, who is an example to thewhole city,--being one whom God maintains there for the reliefand progress of many souls: he, too, came now to give ushis assistance.22. When matters had come to this state, and always with the helpof many prayers, we purchased a house in a convenient spot; andthough it was small, I cared not at all for that, for our Lordhad told me to go into it as well as I could,--that I should seeafterwards what He would do; and how well I have seen it!  I saw,too, how scanty were our means; and yet I believed our Lordwould order these things by other ways, and be gracious unto us.1. See ch. v. § 14, ch. vi. § 1.2. Ch. xxxi. § 3.3.

ISFJ	 XXXIII.The Foundation of the Monastery Hindered.  Our Lord Consolesthe Saint.1. When the matter was in this state--so near its conclusion,that on the very next day the papers were to be signed--then itwas that the Father Provincial changed his mind.  I believe thatthe change was divinely ordered--so it appeared afterwards; forwhile so many prayers were made, our Lord was perfecting His workand arranging its execution in another way.  When the Provincialrefused us, my confessor bade me forthwith to think no more ofit, notwithstanding the great trouble and distress which our Lordknows it cost me to bring it to this state.  When the work wasgiven up and abandoned, people were the more convinced that itwas altogether the foolishness of women; and the complaintsagainst me were multiplied, although I had until then thiscommandment of my Provincial to justify me.2. I was now very much disliked throughout the whole monastery,because I wished to found another with stricter enclosure.It was said I insulted my sisters; that I could serve God amongthem as well as elsewhere, for there were many among them muchbetter than I; that I did not love the house, and that it wouldhave been better if I had procured greater resources for it thanfor another.  Some said I ought to be put in prison; others--butthey were not many--defended me in some degree.  I saw wellenough that they were for the most part right, and now and then Imade excuses for myself; though, as I could not tell them thechief reason, which was the commandment of our Lord, I knew notwhat to do, and so was silent.3. In other respects God was most merciful unto me, for all thiscaused me no uneasiness; and I gave up our design with muchreadiness and joy, as if it cost me nothing.  No one couldbelieve it, not even those men of prayer with whom I conversed;for they thought I was exceedingly pained and sorry: even myconfessor himself could hardly believe it.  I had done, as itseemed to me, all that was in my power.  I thought myself obligedto do no more than I had done to fulfil our Lord's commandment,and so I remained in the house where I was, exceedingly happy andjoyful; though, at the same time, I was never able to give up myconviction that the work would be done.  I had now no means ofdoing it, nor did I know how or when it would be done; but Ifirmly believed in its accomplishment.4. I was much distressed at one time by a letter which myconfessor wrote to me, as if I had done anything in the mattercontrary to his will.  Our Lord also must have meant thatsuffering should not fail me there where I should feel it most;and so, amid the multitude of my persecutions, when, as it seemedto me, consolations should have come from my confessor, he toldme that I ought to recognise in the result that all was a dream;that I ought to lead a new life by ceasing to have anything to dofor the future with it, or even to speak of it any more, seeingthe scandal it had occasioned.  He made some further remarks, allof them very painful.  This was a greater affliction to me thanall the others together.  I considered whether I had doneanything myself, and whether I was to blame for anything that wasan offence unto God; whether all my visions were illusions, allmy prayers a delusion, and I, therefore, deeply deluded and lost.This pressed so heavily upon me, that I was altogether disturbedand most grievously distressed.  But our Lord, who never failedme in all the trials I speak of, so frequently consoled andstrengthened me, that I need not speak of it here.  He told methen not to distress myself; that I had pleased God greatly, andhad not sinned against Him throughout the whole affair; that Iwas to do what my confessors required of me, and be silent on thesubject till the time came to resume it.  I was so comforted andso happy, that the persecution which had befallen me seemed to beas nothing at all.5. Our Lord now showed me what an exceedingly great blessing itis to be tried and persecuted for His sake; for the growth of thelove of God in my soul, which I now discerned, as well as of manyother virtues, was such as to fill me with wonder.  It made meunable to abstain from desiring trials, and yet those about methought I was exceedingly disheartened; and I must have been so,if our Lord in that extremity had not succoured me with His greatcompassion.  Now was the beginning of those more violentimpetuosities of the love of God of which I have spokenbefore, [1] as well as of those profounder trances.  I keptsilence, however, and never spoke of those graces to any one.The saintly Dominican [2] was as confident as I was that the workwould be done; and as I would not speak of it, in order thatnothing might take place contrary to the obedience I owed myconfessor, he communicated with my companion, and they wroteletters to Rome and made their preparations.6. Satan also contrived now that persons should hear one fromanother that I had had a revelation in the matter; and peoplecame to me in great terror, saying that the times were dangerous,that something might be laid to my charge, and that I might betaken before the Inquisitors.  I heard this with pleasure, and itmade me laugh, because I never was afraid of them; for I knewwell enough that in matters of faith I would not break the leastceremony of the Church, that I would expose myself to die athousand times rather than that any one should see me go againstit or against any truth of Holy Writ.  So I told them I was notafraid of that, for my soul must be in a very bad state if therewas anything the matter with it of such a nature as to make mefear the Inquisition; I would go myself and give myself up, if Ithought there was anything amiss; and if I should be denounced,our Lord would deliver me, and I should gain much.7. I had recourse to my Dominican father; for I could rely uponhim, because he was a learned man.  I told him all about myvisions, my way of prayer, the great graces our Lord had givenme, as clearly as I could, and I begged him to consider thematter well, and tell me if there was anything therein atvariance with the Holy Writings, and give me his opinion on thewhole matter.  He reassured me much, and, I think, profitedhimself; for though he was exceedingly good, yet, from this timeforth, he gave himself more and more to prayer, and retired to amonastery of his Order which was very lonely, that he might applyhimself more effectually to prayer, where he remained more thantwo years.  He was dragged out of his solitude by obedience, tohis great sorrow: his superiors required his services; for he wasa man of great ability.  I, too, on my part, felt his retirementvery much, because it was a great loss to me, though I did notdisturb him.  But I knew it was a gain to him; for when I was somuch distressed at his departure, our Lord bade me be comforted,not to take it to heart, for he was gone under good guidance.8. So, when he came back, his soul had made such great progress,and he was so advanced in the ways of the spirit, that he told meon his return he would not have missed that journey for anythingin the world.  And I, too, could say the same thing; for where hereassured and consoled me formerly by his mere learning, he didso now through that spiritual experience he had gained ofsupernatural things.  And God, too, brought him here in time; forHe saw that his help would be required in the foundation of themonastery, which His Majesty willed should be laid.9. I remained quiet after this for five or six months, neitherthinking nor speaking of the matter; nor did our Lord once speakto me about it.  I know not why, but I could never rid myself ofthe thought that the monastery would be founded.  At the end ofthat time, the then Rector [3] of the Society of Jesus havinggone away, His Majesty brought into his place another, [4] ofgreat spirituality, high courage, strong understanding, andprofound learning, at the very time when I was in great straits.As he who then heard my confession had a superior over him--thefathers of the Society are extremely strict about the virtue ofobedience and never stir but in conformity with the will of theirsuperiors,--so he would not dare, though he perfectly understoodmy spirit, and desired the accomplishment of my purpose, to cometo any resolution; and he had many reasons to justify hisconduct.  I was at the same time subject to such greatimpetuosities of spirit, that I felt my chains extremely heavy;nevertheless, I never swerved from the commandment he gave me.10. One day, when in great distress, because I thought myconfessor did not trust me, our Lord said to me, Be not troubled;this suffering will soon be over.  I was very much delighted,thinking I should die shortly; and I was very happy whenever Irecalled those words to remembrance.  Afterwards I saw clearlythat they referred to the coming of the rector of whom I amspeaking, for never again had I any reason to be distressed.The rector that came never interfered with the father-ministerwho was my confessor.  On the contrary, he told him to consoleme,--that there was nothing to be afraid of,--and not to directme along a road so narrow, but to leave the operations of theSpirit of God alone; for now and then it seemed as if these greatimpetuosities of the spirit took away the very breath ofthe soul.11. The rector came to see me, and my confessor bade me speak tohim in all freedom and openness.  I used to feel the verygreatest repugnance to speak of this matter; but so it was, whenI went into the confessional, I felt in my soul something, I knownot what.  I do not remember to have felt so either before orafter towards any one.  I cannot tell what it was, nor do I knowof anything with which I could compare it.  It was a spiritualjoy, and a conviction in my soul that his soul must understandmine, that it was in unison with it, and yet, as I have said, Iknew not how.  If I had ever spoken to him, or had heard greatthings of him, it would have been nothing out of the way that Ishould rejoice in the conviction that he would understand me; buthe had never spoken to me before, nor I to him, and, indeed, hewas a person of whom I had no previous knowledge whatever.12. Afterwards, I saw clearly that my spirit was not deceived;for my relations with him were in every way of the utmost serviceto me and my soul, because his method of direction is proper forthose persons whom our Lord seems to have led far on the way,seeing that He makes them run, and not to crawl step by step.His plan is to render them thoroughly detached and mortified, andour Lord has endowed him with the highest gifts herein as well asin many other things beside.  As soon as I began to have to dowith him, I knew his method at once, and saw that he had a pureand holy soul, with a special grace of our Lord for thediscernment of spirits.  He gave me great consolation.Shortly after I had begun to speak to him, our Lord began toconstrain me to return to the affair of the monastery, and to laybefore my confessor and the father-rector many reasons andconsiderations why they should not stand in my way.  Some ofthese reasons made them afraid, for the father-rector never had adoubt of its being the work of the Spirit of God, because heregarded the fruits of it with great care and attention.  Atlast, after much consideration, they did not dare tohinder me. [5]13. My confessor gave me leave to prosecute the work with all mymight.  I saw well enough the trouble I exposed myself to, for Iwas utterly alone, and able to do so very little.  We agreed thatit should be carried on with the utmost secrecy; and so Icontrived that one of my sisters, [6] who lived out of the town,should buy a house, and prepare it as if for herself, with moneywhich our Lord provided for us. [7]  I made it a great point todo nothing against obedience; but I knew that if I spoke of it tomy superiors all was lost, as on the former occasion, and worseeven might happen.  In holding the money, in finding the house,in treating for it, in putting it in order, I had so much tosuffer; and, for the most part, I had to suffer alone, though myfriend did what she could: she could do but little, and that wasalmost nothing.  Beyond giving her name and her countenance, thewhole of the trouble was mine; and that fell upon me in so manyways, that I am astonished now how I could have borne it. [8]Sometimes, in my affliction, I used to say: O my Lord, how is itthat Thou commandest me to do that which seems impossible?--for,though I am a woman, yet, if I were free, it might be done; butwhen I am tied in so many ways, without money, or the means ofprocuring it, either for the purpose of the Brief or for anyother,--what, O Lord, can I do?14. Once when I was in one of my difficulties, not knowing whatto do, unable to pay the workmen, St. Joseph, my true father andlord, appeared to me, and gave me to understand that money wouldnot be wanting, and I must hire the workmen.  So I did, though Iwas penniless; and our Lord, in a way that filled those who heardof it with wonder, provided for me.  The house offered me was toosmall,--so much so, that it seemed as if it could never be madeinto a monastery,--and I wished to buy another, but had not themeans, and there was neither way nor means to do so. I knew notwhat to do.  There was another little house close to the one wehad, which might have formed a small church.  One day, afterCommunion, our Lord said to me, I have already bidden thee to goin anyhow.  And then, as if exclaiming, said: Oh, covetousness ofthe human race, thinking that even the whole earth is too littlefor it! how often have I slept in the open air, because I had noplace to shelter Me! [9]  I was alarmed, and saw that He had goodreasons to complain.  I went to the little house, arranged thedivisions of it, and found that it would make a sufficient,though small, monastery.  I did not care now to add to the siteby purchase, and so I did nothing but contrive to have itprepared in such a way that it could be lived in.  Everything wascoarse, and nothing more was done to it than to render it nothurtful to health--and that must be done everywhere.15. As I was going to Communion on her feast, St. Clare appearedto me in great beauty, and bade me take courage, and go on withwhat I had begun; she would help me.  I began to have a greatdevotion to St. Clare; and she has so truly kept her word, that amonastery of nuns of her Order in our neighbourhood helped us tolive; and, what is of more importance, by little and little sheso perfectly fulfilled my desire, that the poverty which theblessed Saint observes in her own house is observed in this, andwe are living on alms.  It cost me no small labour to have thismatter settled by the plenary sanction and authority of the HolyFather, [10] so that it shall never be otherwise, and we possessno revenues.  Our Lord is doing more for us--perhaps we owe it tothe prayers of this blessed Saint; for, without our askinganybody, His Majesty supplies most abundantly all our wants.May He be blessed for ever!  Amen.16. On one of these days--it was the Feast of the Assumption ofour Lady--I was in the church of the monastery of the Order ofthe glorious St. Dominic, thinking of the events of my wretchedlife, and of the many sins which in times past I had confessed inthat house.  I fell into so profound a trance, that I was as itwere beside myself.  I sat down, and it seemed as if I couldneither see the Elevation nor hear Mass.  This afterwards becamea scruple to me.  I thought then, when I was in that state, thatI saw myself clothed with a garment of excessive whiteness andsplendour.  At first I did not see who was putting it on me.Afterwards I saw our Lady on my right hand, and my fatherSt. Joseph on my left, clothing me with that garment.  I wasgiven to understand that I was then cleansed from my sins.When I had been thus clad--I was filled with the utmost delightand joy--our Lady seemed at once to take me by both hands.She said that I pleased her very much by being devout to theglorious St. Joseph; that I might rely on it my desires about themonastery were accomplished, and that our Lord and they too wouldbe greatly honoured in it; that I was to be afraid of no failurewhatever, though the obedience under which it would be placedmight not be according to my mind, because they would watch overus, and because her Son had promised to be with us [11]--and, asa proof of this, she would give me that jewel.  She then seemedto throw around my neck a most splendid necklace of gold, fromwhich hung a cross of great value.  The stones and gold were sodifferent from any in this world, that there is nothing wherewithto compare them.  The beauty of them is such as can be conceivedby no imagination,--and no understanding can find out thematerials of the robe, nor picture to itself the splendours whichour Lord revealed, in comparison with which all the splendours ofearth, so to say, are a daubing of soot.  This beauty, which Isaw in our Lady, was exceedingly grand, though I did not trace itin any particular feature, but rather in the whole form of herface. She was clothed in white and her garments shone withexcessive lustre that was not dazzling, but soft.  I did not seeSt. Joseph so distinctly, though I saw clearly that he was there,as in the visions of which I spoke before, [12] in which nothingis seen.  Our Lady seemed to be very young.17. When they had been with me for a while,--I, too, in thegreatest delight and joy, greater than I had ever had before, asI think, and with which I wished never to part,--I saw them, soit seemed, ascend up to heaven, attended by a great multitude ofangels.  I was left in great loneliness, though so comforted andraised up, so recollected in prayer and softened, that I was forsome time unable to move or speak--being, as it were, besidemyself.  I was now possessed by a strong desire to be consumedfor the love of God, and by other affections of the same kind.Everything took place in such a way that I could never have adoubt--though I often tried--that the vision came from God. [13]It left me in the greatest consolation and peace.18. As to that which the Queen of the Angels spoke aboutobedience, it is this: it was painful to me not to subject themonastery to the Order, and our Lord had told me that it wasinexpedient to do so.  He told me the reasons why it was in nowise convenient that I should do it but I must send to Rome in acertain way, which He also explained; He would take care that Ifound help there: and so I did.  I sent to Rome, as our Lorddirected me,--for we should never have succeeded otherwise,--andmost favourable was the result.19. And as to subsequent events, it was very convenient to beunder the Bishop, [14] but at that time I did not know him, nordid I know what kind of a superior he might be.  It pleased ourLord that he should be as good and favourable to this house as itwas necessary he should be on account of the great opposition itmet with at the beginning, as I shall show hereafter, [15] andalso for the sake of bringing it to the condition it is now in.Blessed be He who has done it all!  Amen.1. Ch. xxi. § 6, ch. xxix. §§ 10, 11.2. Pedro Ibañez.  See ch. xxxviii. § 15.3. Dionisio Vasquez.  Of him the Bollandists say that he was veryaustere and harsh to his subjects, notwithstanding his greatlearning: 'homini egregie docto ac rebus gestis claro, sed insubditos, ut ex historia Societatis Jesu liquet, valde immiti'(n. 309).4. Gaspar de Salazar was made rector of the house in Avila in1561, therein succeeding Vasquez (Bollandists, ibid.).5. St. Teresa was commanded by our Lord to ask Father BaltasarAlvarez to make a meditation on Psalm xci. 6: 'Quam magnificatasunt opera Tua.'  The Saint obeyed, and the meditation was made.From that moment, as F.

The money was a present from her brother, Don Lorenzo deCepeda; and the Saint acknowledges the receipt of it, andconfesses the use made of it, in a letter to her brother, writtenin Avila, Dec. 31, 1561 (De la Fuente).8. One day, she went with her sister--she was staying in herhouse--to hear a sermon in the church of St. Thomas.  The zealouspreacher denounced visions and revelations; and his observationswere so much to the point, that there was no need of his sayingthat they were directed against St. Teresa, who was present.Her sister was greatly hurt, and persuaded the Saint to return tothe monastery at once (Reforma, i. ch. xlii. § 1).9.

ISFJ	 XXXIV.The Saint Leaves Her Monastery of the Incarnation for a Time, atthe Command of Her Superior.  Consoles an Afflicted Widow.1. Now, though I was very careful that no one should know what wewere doing, all this work could not be carried on so secretly asnot to come to the knowledge of divers persons; some believed, init, others did not, I was in great fear lest the Provincialshould be spoken to about it when he came, and find himselfcompelled to order me to give it up; and if he did so, it wouldhave been abandoned at once.  Our Lord provided against it inthis way.  In a large city, more than twenty leagues distant, wasa lady in great distress on account of her husband's death. [1]She was in such extreme affliction, that fears were entertainedabout her life.  She had heard of me, a poor sinner,--for ourLord had provided that,--and men spoke well to her of me, for thesake of other good works which resulted from it.  This lady knewthe Provincial well; and as she was a person of someconsideration, and knew that I lived in a monastery the nuns ofwhich were permitted to go out, our Lord made her desire much tosee me.  She thought that my presence would be a consolation toher, and that she could not be comforted otherwise.She therefore strove by all the means in her power to get me intoher house, sending messages to the Provincial, who was at adistance far away.2. The Provincial sent me an order, charging me in virtue of myobedience to go immediately, with one companion.  I knew of it onChristmas night.  It caused me some trouble and much suffering tosee that they sent for me because they thought there was somegood in me; I, knowing myself to be so wicked, could not bear it.I commended myself earnestly to God, and during Matins, or thegreater part of them, was lost in a profound trance.  Our Lordtold me I must go without fail, and give no heed to the opinionsof people, for they were few who would not be rash in theircounsel; and though I should have troubles, yet God would beserved greatly: as to the monastery, it was expedient I should beabsent till the Brief came, because Satan had contrived a greatplot against the coming of the Provincial; that I was to have nofear,--He would help me.  I repeated this to the rector, and hetold me that I must go by all means, though others were saying Iought not to go, that it was a trick of Satan to bring some evilupon me there, and that I ought to send word to the Provincial.3. I obeyed the rector, and went without fear, because of what Ihad understood in prayer, though in the greatest confusion when Ithought of the reasons why they sent for me, and how very muchthey were deceived.  It made me more and more importunate withour Lord that He would not abandon me.  It was a great comfortthat there was a house of the Society of Jesus there whither Iwas going, and so I thought I should be in some degree safe underthe direction of those fathers, as I had been here.4. It was the good pleasure of our Lord that the lady who sentfor me should be so much consoled that a visible improvement wasthe immediate result she was comforted every day more and more.This was very remarkable, because, as I said before, hersuffering had reduced her to great straits.  Our Lord must havedone this in answer to the many prayers which the good people ofmy acquaintance made for me, that I might prosper in my work.She had a profound fear of God, and was so good, that her greatdevotion supplied my deficiencies.  She conceived a greataffection for me--I, too, for her, because of her goodness; butall was as it were a cross for me; for the comforts of her housewere a great torment, and her making so much of me made meafraid.  I kept my soul continually recollected--I did not dareto be careless: nor was our Lord careless of me; for while I wasthere, He bestowed the greatest graces upon me, and those gracesmade me so free, and filled me with such contempt for all Isaw,--and the more I saw, the greater my contempt,--that I neverfailed to treat those ladies, whom to serve would have been agreat honour for me, with as much freedom as if I had beentheir equal.5. I derived very great advantages from this, and I said so.I saw that she was a woman, and as much liable to passion andweakness as I was; that rank is of little worth, and the higherit is, the greater the anxiety and trouble it brings.People must be careful of the dignity of their state, which willnot suffer them to live at ease; they must eat at fixed hours andby rule, for everything must be according to their state, and notaccording to their constitutions; and they have frequently totake food fitted more for their state than for their liking.6. So it was that I came to hate the very wish to be a greatlady.  God deliver me from this wicked, artificial life!--thoughI believe that this lady, notwithstanding that she was one of thechief personages of the realm, was a woman of great simplicity,and that few were more humble than she was.  I was very sorry forher, for I saw how often she had to submit to much that wasdisagreeable to her, because of the requirements of her rank.Then, as to servants, though this lady had very good servants,how slight is that little trust that may be put in them!One must not be conversed with more than another; otherwise, hewho is so favoured is envied by the rest.  This of itself is aslavery, and one of the lies of the world is that it calls suchpersons masters, who, in my eyes, are nothing else but slaves ina thousand ways.7. It was our Lord's pleasure that the household of that ladyimproved in the service of His Majesty during my stay there,though I was not exempted from some trials and some jealousies onthe part of some of its members, because of the great affectiontheir mistress had for me.  They perhaps must have thought I hadsome personal interest to serve.  Our Lord must have permittedsuch matters, and others of the same kind, to give me trouble, inorder that I might not be absorbed in the comforts whichotherwise I had there; and He was pleased to deliver me out of itall with great profit to my soul.8. When I was there, a religious person of great consideration,and with whom I had conversed occasionally some years ago, [2]happened to arrive.  When I was at Mass, in a monastery of hisOrder, near the house in which I was staying, I felt a longing toknow the state of his soul,--for I wished him to be a greatservant of God,--and I rose up in order to go and speak to him.But as I was then recollected in prayer, it seemed to me a wasteof time--for what had I to do in that matter?--and so I returnedto my place.  Three times, I think I did this, and at last mygood angel prevailed over the evil one, and I went and asked forhim; and he came to speak to me in one of the confessionals.We began by asking one another of our past lives, for we had notseen one another for many years.  I told him that my life hadbeen one in which my soul had had many trials.  He insisted muchon my telling him what those trials were.  I said that they werenot to be told, and that I was not to tell them.  He replied thatthe Dominican father, [3] of whom I have spoken, knew them, andthat, as they were great friends, he could learn them from him,and so I had better tell them without hesitation.9. The fact is, that it was not in his power not to insist, norin mine, I believe, to refuse to speak; for notwithstanding allthe trouble and shame I used to feel formerly, I spoke of mystate, to him, and to the rector whom I have referred tobefore, [4] without any difficulty whatever; on the contrary, itwas a great consolation to me; and so I told him all inconfession.  He seemed to me then more prudent than ever; thoughI had always looked upon him as a man of great understanding.I considered what high gifts and endowments for great services hehad, if he gave himself wholly unto God.  I had this feeling nowfor many years, so that I never saw any one who pleased me muchwithout wishing at once he were given wholly unto God; andsometimes I feel this so keenly, that I can hardly containmyself.  Though I long to see everybody serve God, yet my desireabout those who please me is very vehement, and so I importuneour Lord on their behalf.10. So it happened with respect to this religious.  He asked meto pray much for him to God.  There was no necessity for hisdoing so, because I could not do anything else, and so I wentback to my place where I was in the habit of praying alone, andbegan to pray to our Lord, being extremely recollected, in thatmy simple, silly way, when I speak without knowing very oftenwhat I am saying.  It is love that speaks, and my soul is sobeside itself, that I do not regard the distance between it andGod.  That love which I know His Majesty has for it makes itforget itself, and think itself to be one with Him; and so, asbeing one with Him, and not divided from Him, the soul speaksfoolishly.  When I had prayed with many tears that the soul ofthis religious might serve Him truly,--for, though I consideredit good, it was not enough for me; I would have it muchbetter,--I remember I said, 'O Lord, Thou must not refuse me thisgrace; behold him,--he is a fit person to be our friend.'11. Oh, the great goodness and compassion of God!  How He regardsnot the words, but the desire and the will with which they arespoken!  How He suffered such a one as I am to speak so boldlybefore His Majesty!  May He be blessed for evermore!12. I remember that during those hours of prayer on that verynight I was extremely distressed by the thought whether I was inthe grace of God, and that I could never know whether I was so ornot,--not that I wished to know it; I wished, however, to die, inorder that I might not live a life in which I was not sure that Iwas not dead in sin, for there could be no death more dreadfulfor me than to think that I had sinned against God.  I was ingreat straits at this thought.  I implored Him not to suffer meto fall into sin, with great sweetness, dissolved in tears.Then I heard that I might console myself, and trust [5] that Iwas in a state of grace, because a love of God like mine,together with the graces and feelings with which His Majestyfilled my soul, was of such a nature as to be inconsistent with astate of mortal sin.13. I was now confident that our Lord would grant my prayer as tothat religious.  He bade me repeat certain words to him.  This Ifelt much, because I knew not how to speak to him; for thiscarrying messages to a third person, as I have said, [6] is whatI have always felt the most, especially when I did not know howthat person would take them, nor whether he would not laugh atme.  This placed me in great difficulties, but at last I was soconvinced I ought to do it, that I believe I made a promise toGod I would not neglect that message; and because of the greatshame I felt, I wrote it out, and gave it in that way.The result showed clearly enough that it was a message from God,for that religious resolved with great earnestness to givehimself to prayer, though he did not do so at once.  Our Lordwould have him for Himself, so He sent me to tell him certaintruths which, without my understanding them, were so much to thepurpose that he was astonished.  Our Lord must have prepared himto receive them as from His Majesty; and though I am but amiserable sinner myself, yet I made many supplications to ourLord to convert him thoroughly, and to make him hate thepleasures and the things of this life.  And so he did--blessed beGod!--for every time that he spoke to me I was in a manner besidemyself; and if I had not seen it, I should never have believedthat our Lord would have given him in so short a time graces somatured, and filled him so full of God, that he seemed to bealive to nothing on earth.14. May His Majesty hold him in His hand!  If he will go on--andI trust in our Lord he will do so, now that he is so wellgrounded in the knowledge of himself--he will be one of the mostdistinguished servants of God, to the great profit of many souls,because he has in a short time had great experience in spiritualthings: that is a gift of God, which He gives when He will and asHe will, and it depends not on length of time nor extent ofservice.  I do not mean that time and service, are not greathelps, but very often our Lord will not give to some in twentyyears the grace of contemplation, while He gives it to others inone,--His Majesty knoweth why.  We are under a delusion when wethink that in the course of years we shall come to the knowledgeof that which we can in no way attain to but by experience; andthus many are in error, as I have said [7] when they wouldunderstand spirituality without being spiritual themselves.  I donot mean that a man who is not spiritual, if he is learned, maynot direct one that is spiritual; but it must be understood thatin outward and inward things, in the order of nature, thedirection must be an act of reason; and in supernatural things,according to the teaching of the sacred writings.  In othermatters, let him not distress himself, nor think that he canunderstand that which he understandeth not; neither let himquench the Spirit; [8] for now another Master, greater than he,is directing these souls, so that they are not left withoutauthority over them.15. He must not be astonished at this, nor think it impossible:all things are possible to our Lord; [9] he must strive rather tostrengthen his faith, and humble himself, because in this matterour Lord imparts perhaps a deeper knowledge to some old womanthan to him, though he may be a very learned man.  Being thushumble, he will profit souls and himself more than if he affectedto be a contemplative without being so; for, I repeat it, if hehave no experience, if he have not a most profound humility,whereby he may see that he does not understand, and that thething is not for that reason impossible, he will do himself butlittle good, and still less to his penitent.  But if he ishumble, let him have no fear that our Lord will allow either theone or the other to fall into delusion.16. Now as to this father I am speaking of, as our Lord has givenhim light in many things, so has he laboured to find out by studythat which in this matter can be by study ascertained; for he isa very learned man, and that of which he has no experiencehimself he seeks to find out from those who have it,--and ourLord helps him by increasing his faith, and so he has greatlybenefited himself and some other souls, of whom mine is one.As our Lord knew the trials I had to undergo, His Majesty seemsto have provided that, when He took away unto Himself some ofthose who directed me, others might remain, who helped me in mygreat afflictions, and rendered me great services.17. Our Lord wrought a complete change in this father, so much sothat he scarcely knew himself, so to speak.  He has given himbodily health, so that he may do penance, such as he never hadbefore; for he was sickly.  He has given him courage to undertakegood works, with other gifts, so that he seems to have received amost special vocation from our Lord.  May He be blessed for ever!18. All these blessings, I believe, came to him through thegraces our Lord bestowed upon him in prayer; for they are real.It has been our Lord's pleasure already to try him in certaindifficulties, out of which he has come forth like one who knowsthe true worth of that merit which is gained by sufferingpersecutions.  I trust in the munificence of our Lord that greatgood will, by his means, accrue to some of his Order and to theOrder itself.  This is beginning to be understood.  I have hadgreat visions on the subject, and our Lord has told me wonderfulthings of him and of the Rector of the Society of Jesus, whom Iam speaking of, [10] and also of two other religious of the Orderof St. Dominic, particularly of one who, to his own profit, hasactually learned of our Lord certain things which I had formerlyunderstood of him.  But there were greater things made known ofhim to whom I am now referring: one of them I will now relate.19. I was with him once in the parlour, when in my soul andspirit I felt what great love burned within him, and became as itwere lost in ecstasy by considering the greatness of God, who hadraised that soul in so short a time to a state so high.  It mademe ashamed of myself when I saw him listen with so much humilityto what I was saying about certain matters of prayer, when I hadso little myself that I could speak on the subject to one likehim.  Our Lord must have borne with me in this on account of thegreat desire I had to see that religious making great progress.My interview with him did me great good,--it seems as if it lefta new fire in my soul, burning with desire to serve our Lord asin the beginning.  O my Jesus! what is a soul on fire with Thylove!  How we ought to prize it, and implore our Lord to let itlive long upon earth!  He who has this love should follow aftersuch souls, if it be possible.20. It is a great thing for a person ill of this disease to findanother struck down by it,--it comforts him much to see that heis not alone; they help one another greatly to suffer and tomerit.  They are strong with a double strength who are resolvedto risk a thousand lives for God, and who long for an opportunityof losing them.  They are like soldiers who, to acquire booty,and therewith enrich themselves, wish for war, knowing well thatthey cannot become rich without it.  This is their work--tosuffer.  Oh, what a blessing it is when our Lord gives light tounderstand how great is the gain of suffering for Him!  This isnever understood till we have left all things; for if anybody isattached to any one thing, that is a proof that he sets somevalue upon it; and if he sets any value upon it, it is painful tobe compelled to give it up.  In that case, everything isimperfect and lost.  The saying is to the purpose here,--he whofollows what is lost, is lost himself; and what greater loss,what greater blindness, what greater calamity, can there be thanmaking much of that which is nothing!21. I now return to that which I had begun to speak of.  I was inthe greatest joy, beholding that soul.  It seemed as if our Lordwould have me see clearly the treasures He had laid up in it; andso, when I considered the favour our Lord had shown me, in that Ishould be the means of so great a good, I recognised my ownunworthiness for such an end.  I thought much of the graces ourLord had given him, and held myself as indebted for them morethan if they had been given to myself.  So I gave thanks to ourLord, when I saw that His Majesty had fulfilled my desires andheard my petition that He would raise up persons like him.And now my soul, no longer able to bear the joy that filled it,went forth out of itself, losing itself that it might gain themore. It lost sight of the reflections it was making; and thehearing of that divine language which the Holy Ghost seemed tospeak threw me into a deep trance, which almost deprived me ofall sense, though it did not last long.  I saw Christ, inexceeding great majesty and glory, manifesting His joy at whatwas then passing.  He told me as much, and it was His pleasurethat I should clearly see that He was always present at similarinterviews, and how much He was pleased when people thus foundtheir delight in speaking of Him.22. On another occasion, when far away from this place, I saw himcarried by angels in great glory.  I understood by that visionthat his soul was making great progress: so it was; for an evilreport was spread abroad against him by one to whom he hadrendered a great service, and whose reputation and whose soul hehad saved.  He bore it with much joy.  He did also other thingsgreatly to the honour of God, and underwent more persecutions.I do not think it expedient now to speak further on this point;if, however, you, my father, who know all, should hereafter thinkotherwise, more might be said to the glory of our Lord.23. All the prophecies spoken of before, [11] relating to thishouse, as well as others, of which I shall speak hereafter,relating to it and to other matters, have been accomplished.Some of them our Lord revealed to me three years before theybecame known, others earlier and others later.  But I always madethem known to my confessor, and to the widow my friend; for I hadleave to communicate with her, as I said before. [12]  She, Iknow, repeated them to others, and these know that I lie not.May God never permit me, in any matter whatever,--much more inthings of this importance,--to say anything but the whole truth!24. One of my brothers-in-law [13] died suddenly; and as I was ingreat distress at this, because he had no opportunity of makinghis confession, our Lord said to me in prayer that my sister alsowas to die in the same way; that I must go to her, and make herprepare herself for such an end.  I told this to my confessor;but as he would not let me go, I heard the same warning again;and now, when he saw this, he told me I might go, and that Ishould lose nothing by going.  My sister was living in thecountry; and as I did not tell her why I came, I gave her whatlight I could in all things.  I made her go frequently toconfession, and look to her soul in everything.  She was verygood, and did as I asked her.  Four or five years after she hadbegun this practice, and keeping a strict watch over herconscience, she died, with nobody near her, and without beingable to go to confession.  This was a blessing to her, for it waslittle more than a week since she had been to her accustomedconfession.  It was a great joy to me when I heard of her death.She was but a short time in purgatory.25. I do not think it was quite eight days afterwards when, afterCommunion, our Lord appeared to me, and was pleased that I shouldsee Him receive my sister into glory.  During all those years,after our Lord had spoken to me, until her death, what I thenlearnt with respect to her was never forgotten either by myselfor by my friend, who, when my sister was thus dead, came to me ingreat amazement at the fulfilment of the prophecy.  God bepraised for ever, who takes such care of souls that they may notbe lost!1.

Garciaof Toledo, brother of Don Fernando, Duke of Alva; and Don Vicentede la Fuente thinks the opinion of Fr. Antonio the more probable.3. Pedro Ibañez (Bouix).4. Ch. xxxiii. § 11.5. Father Bouix says that here the word 'confiar,' 'trust,' inthe printed text, has been substituted by some one for the words'estar cierta,' 'be certain,' which he found in the MS.  But DonVicente de la Fuente retains the old reading 'confiar,' and makesno observation on the alleged discrepancy between the MS. and theprinted text.  The observation of F. Bouix, however, is moreimportant, and deserves credit,--for Don Vicente may have failed,through mere inadvertence, to see what F. Bouix saw; and it isalso to be remembered that Don Vicente does not say that theMS. on this point has been so closely inspected as to throw anydoubt on the positive testimony of F. Bouix.

ISFJ	 XXXV.The Foundation of the House of St. Joseph.  The Observation ofHoly Poverty Therein.  How the Saint Left Toledo.1. When I was staying with this lady, [1] already spoken of, inwhose house I remained more than six months, our Lord ordainedthat a holy woman [2] of our Order should hear of me, who wasmore than seventy leagues away from the place.  She happened totravel this way, and went some leagues out of her road that shemight see me.  Our Lord had moved her in the same year, and inthe same month of the year, that He had moved me, to foundanother monastery of the Order; and as He had given her thisdesire, she sold all she possessed, and went to Rome to obtainthe necessary faculties.  She went on foot, and barefooted.She is a woman of great penance and prayer, and one to whom ourLord gave many graces; and our Lady appeared to her, andcommanded her to undertake this work.  Her progress in theservice of our Lord was so much greater than mine, that I wasashamed to stand in her presence.  She showed me Briefs shebrought from Rome, and during the fortnight she remained with mewe laid our plan for the founding of these monasteries.2. Until I spoke to her, I never knew that our rule, before itwas mitigated, required of us that we should possess nothing; [3]nor was I going to found a monastery without revenue, [4] for myintention was that we should be without anxiety about all thatwas necessary for us, and I did not think of the many anxietieswhich the possession of property brings in its train.  This holywoman, taught of our Lord, perfectly understood--though she couldnot read--what I was ignorant of, notwithstanding my having readthe Constitutions [5] so often; and when she told me of it, Ithought it right, though I feared they would never consent tothis, but would tell me I was committing follies, and that Iought not to do anything whereby I might bring suffering uponothers.  If this concerned only myself, nothing should have keptme back,--on the contrary, it would have been my great joy tothink that I was observing the counsels of Christ our Lord; forHis Majesty had already given me great longings for poverty. [6]3. As for myself, I never doubted that this was the better part;for I had now for some time wished it were possible in my stateto go about begging, for the love of God--to have no house of myown, nor anything else.  But I was afraid that others--if ourLord did not give them the same desire--might live in discontent.Moreover, I feared that it might be the cause of somedistraction: for I knew some poor monasteries not veryrecollected, and I did not consider that their not beingrecollected was the cause of their poverty, and that theirpoverty was not the cause of their distraction: distraction nevermakes people richer, and God never fails those who serve Him.In short, I was weak in faith; but not so this servant of God.4. As I took the advice of many in everything, I found scarcelyany one of this opinion--neither my confessor, nor the learnedmen to whom I spoke of it.  They gave me so many reasons theother way, that I did not know what to do.  But when I saw whatthe rule required, and that poverty was the more perfect way, Icould not persuade myself to allow an endowment.  And though theydid persuade me now and then that they were right, yet, when Ireturned to my prayer, and saw Christ on the cross, so poor anddestitute, I could not bear to be rich, and I implored Him withtears so to order matters that I might be poor as He was.5. I found that so many inconveniences resulted from anendowment, and saw that it was the cause of so much trouble, andeven distraction, that I did nothing but dispute with thelearned.  I wrote to that Dominican friar [7] who was helping us,and he sent back two sheets by way of reply, full of objectionsand theology against my plan, telling me that he had thought muchon the subject.  I answered that, in order to escape from myvocation, the vow of poverty I had made, and the perfectobservance of the counsels of Christ, I did not want any theologyto help me, and in this case I should not thank him for hislearning.  If I found any one who would help me, it pleased memuch.  The lady in whose house I was staying was a great help tome in this matter.  Some at first told me that they agreed withme; afterwards, when they had considered the matter longer, theyfound in it so many inconveniences that they insisted on mygiving it up.  I told them that, though they changed theiropinion so quickly, I would abide by the first.6. At this time, because of my entreaties,--for the lady hadnever seen the holy friar, Peter of Alcantara,--it pleased ourLord to bring him to her house.  As he was a great lover ofpoverty, and had lived in it for so many years, he knew well thetreasures it contains, and so he was a great help to me; hecharged me on no account whatever to give up my purpose.Now, having this opinion and sanction,--no one was better able togive it, because he knew what it was by long experience,--I  madeup my mind to seek no further advice.7. One day, when I was very earnestly commending the matter toGod, our Lord told me that I must by no means give up my purposeof founding the monastery in poverty; it was His will, and thewill of His Father: He would help me.  I was in a trance; and theeffects were such, that I could have no doubt it came from God.On another occasion, He said to me that endowments bredconfusion, with other things in praise of poverty; and assured methat whosoever served Him would never be in want of the necessarymeans of living: and this want, as I have said, [8] I neverfeared myself.  Our Lord changed the dispositions also of thelicentiate,--I am speaking of the Dominican friar, [9]--who, as Isaid, wrote to me that I should not found the monastery withoutan endowment.  Now, I was in the greatest joy at hearing this;and having these opinions in my favour, it seemed to me nothingless than the possession of all the wealth of the world, when Ihad resolved to live in poverty for the love of God.8. At this time, my Provincial withdrew the order and theobedience, in virtue of which I was staying in that house. [10]He left it to me to do as I liked: if I wished to return I mightdo so; if I wished to remain I might also do so for a certaintime. But during that time the elections in my monastery [11]would take place and I was told that many of the nuns wished tolay on me the burden of superiorship.  The very thought of thisalone was a great torment to me; for though I was resolved toundergo readily any kind of martyrdom for God, I could notpersuade myself at all to accept this; for, putting aside thegreat trouble it involved,--because the nuns were so many,--andother reasons, such as that I never wished for it, nor for anyother office,--on the contrary, had always refused them,--itseemed to me that my conscience would be in great danger; and soI praised God that I was not then in my convent.  I wrote to myfriends and asked them not to vote for me.9. When I was rejoicing that I was not in that trouble, our Lordsaid to me that I was on no account to keep away; that as Ilonged for a cross, there was one ready for me, and that a heavyone: that I was not to throw it away, but go on with resolution;He would help me, and I must go at once.  I was very muchdistressed, and did nothing but weep, because I thought that mycross was to be the office of prioress; and, as I have just said,I could not persuade myself that it would be at all good for mysoul--nor could I see any means by which it would be.  I told myconfessor of it, and he commanded me to return at once: that todo so was clearly the most perfect way; and that, because theheat was very great,--it would be enough if I arrived before theelection,--I might wait a few days, in order that my journeymight do me no harm.10. But our Lord had ordered it otherwise.  I had to go at once,because the uneasiness I felt was very great; and I was unable topray, and thought I was failing in obedience to the commandmentsof our Lord, and that as I was happy and contented where I was, Iwould not go to meet trouble.  All my service of God there waslip-service: why did I, having the opportunity of living ingreater perfection, neglect it?  If I died on the road, let medie.  Besides, my soul was in great straits, and our Lord hadtaken from me all sweetness in prayer.  In short, I was in such astate of torment, that I begged the lady to let me go; for myconfessor, when he saw the plight I was in, had already told meto go, God having moved him as He had moved me.  The lady felt mydeparture very much, and that was another pain to bear; for ithad cost her much trouble, and diverse importunities of theProvincial, to have me in her house.11. I considered it a very great thing for her to have given herconsent, when she felt it so much; but, as she was a person whofeared God exceedingly,--and as I told her, among many otherreasons, that my going away tended greatly to His service, andheld out the hope that I might possibly return,--she gave way,but with much sorrow.  I was now not sorry myself at coming away,for I knew that it was an act of greater perfection, and for theservice of God.  So the pleasure I had in pleasing God took awaythe pain of quitting that lady,--whom I saw suffering sokeenly,--and others to whom I owed much, particularly myconfessor of the Society of Jesus, in whom I found all I needed.But the greater the consolations I lost for our Lord's sake, thegreater was my joy in losing them.  I could not understand it,for I had a clear consciousness of these two contraryfeelings--pleasure, consolation, and joy in that which weigheddown my soul with sadness.  I was joyful and tranquil, and hadopportunities of spending many hours in prayer; and I saw that Iwas going to throw myself into a fire; for our Lord had alreadytold me that I was going to carry a heavy cross,--though I neverthought it would be so heavy as I afterwards found it to be,--yetI went forth rejoicing.  I was distressed because I had notalready begun the fight, since it was our Lord's will that Ishould be in it.  Thus His Majesty gave me strength, andestablished it in my weakness. [12]12. As I have just said, I could not understand how this couldbe.  I thought of this illustration: if I were possessed of ajewel, or any other thing which gave me great pleasure, and itcame to my knowledge that a person whom I loved more than myself,and whose satisfaction I preferred to my own, wished to have it,it would give me great pleasure to deprive myself of it, becauseI would give all I possessed to please that person.  Now, as thepleasure of giving pleasure to that person surpasses any pleasureI have in that jewel myself, I should not be distressed in givingaway that or anything else I loved, nor at the loss of thatpleasure which the possession of it gave me.  So now, though Iwished to feel some distress when I saw that those whom I wasleaving felt my going so much, yet, notwithstanding my naturallygrateful disposition,--which, under other circumstances, wouldhave been enough to have caused me great pain,--at this time,though I wished to feel it, I could feel none.13. The delay of another day was so serious a matter in theaffairs of this holy house, that I know not how they would havebeen settled if I had waited.  Oh, God is great!  I am often lostin wonder when I consider and see the special help which HisMajesty gave me towards the establishment of this little cell ofGod,--for such I believe it to be,--the lodging wherein HisMajesty delights; for once, when I was in prayer, He told me thatthis house was the paradise of his delight. [13]  It seems, then,that His Majesty has chosen these whom he has drawn hither, amongwhom I am living very much ashamed of myself. [14]  I could nothave even wished for souls such as they are for the purpose ofthis house, where enclosure, poverty, and prayer are so strictlyobserved; they submit with so much joy and contentment, thatevery one of them thinks herself unworthy of the grace of beingreceived into it,--some of them particularly; for our Lord hascalled them out of the vanity and dissipation of the world, inwhich, according to its laws, they might have lived contented.Our Lord has multiplied their joy, so that they see clearly howHe had given them a hundredfold for the one thing they haveleft, [15] and for which they cannot thank His Majesty enough.Others He has advanced from well to better.  To the young Hegives courage and knowledge, so that they may desire nothingelse, and also to understand that to live away from all things inthis life is to live in greater peace even here below.  To thosewho are no longer young, and whose health is weak, He gives--andhas given--the strength to undergo the same austerities andpenance with all the others.14. O my Lord! how Thou dost show Thy power!  There is no need toseek reasons for Thy will; for with Thee, against all naturalreason, all things are possible: so that thou teachest clearlythere is no need of anything but of loving Thee [16] in earnest,and really giving up everything for Thee, in order that Thou, Omy Lord, might make everything easy.  It is well said that Thoufeignest to make Thy law difficult: [17] I do not see it, nor doI feel that the way that leadeth unto Thee is narrow. I see it asa royal road, and not a pathway; a road upon which whosoeverreally enters, travels most securely.  No mountain passes and nocliffs are near it: these are the occasions of sin. I call that apass,--a dangerous pass,--and a narrow road, which has on oneside a deep hollow, into which one stumbles, and on the other aprecipice, over which they who are careless fall, and are dashedto pieces.  He who loves Thee, O my God, travels safely by theopen and royal road, far away from the precipice: he has scarcelystumbled at all, when Thou stretchest forth Thy hand to save him.One fall--yea, many falls--if he does but love Thee, and not thethings of the world, are not enough to make him perish; hetravels in the valley of humility.  I cannot understand what itis that makes men afraid of the way of perfection.15. May our Lord of His mercy make us see what a poor security wehave in the midst of dangers so manifest, when we live like therest of the world; and that true security consists in striving toadvance in the way of God!  Let us fix our eyes upon Him, andhave no fear that the Sun of justice will ever set, or suffer usto travel to our ruin by night, unless we first look away fromHim.  People are not afraid of living in the midst of lions,every one of whom seems eager to tear them: I am speaking ofhonours, pleasures, and the like joys, as the world calls them:and herein the devil seems to make us afraid of ghosts.  I amastonished a thousand times, and ten thousand times would Irelieve myself by weeping, and proclaim aloud my own greatblindness and wickedness, if, perchance, it might help in somemeasure to open their eyes.  May He, who is almighty, of Hisgoodness open their eyes, and never suffer mine to beblind again!1. Doña Luisa de la Cerda.2. Maria of Jesus was the daughter of a Reporter of Causes in theChancery of Granada; but his name and that of his wife are notknown.  Maria married, but became a widow soon afterwards.She then became a novice in the Carmelite monastery in Granada,and during her noviciate had revelations, like those ofSt. Teresa, about a reform of the Order.  Her confessor madelight of her revelations, and she then referred them to F. Gasparde Salazar, a confessor of St. Teresa, who was then in Granada.He approved of them, and Maria left the noviciate, and went toRome with two holy women of the Order of St. Francis.  The threemade the journey on foot, and, moreover, barefooted.  Pope PiusIV. heard her prayer, and, looking at her torn and bleeding feet,said to her, 'Woman of strong courage, let it be as thou wilt.'She returned to Granada, but both the Carmelites and the cityrefused her permission to found her house there, and some went sofar as to threaten to have her publicly whipped.  Doña Leonor deMascareñas gave her a house in Alcala de Henares, of which shetook possession Sept. 11, 1562; but the house was formallyconstituted July 23, 1563, and subjected to the Bishop ten daysafter (Reforma, i. c. 59; and Don Vicente, vol. i. p. 255).The latter says that the Chronicler is in error when he assertsthat this monastery of Maria of Jesus was endowed.3. The sixth chapter of the rule is: 'Nullus fratrum sibi aliquidproprium, esse dicat, sed sint vobis omnia communia.'4. See ch. xxxii. § 13.5. The Constitutions which the Saint read in the Monastery of theIncarnation must have been the Constitutions grounded on theMitigated Rule which was sanctioned by Eugenius IV. (RomaniPontificis, A.D. 1432).6. See Relation, i. § 10.7. F. Pedro Ibañez.8. Ch. xi. § 3.9. F. Pedro Ibañez.10. The house of Doña Luisa, in Toledo.11.

When the workmen were busy with the building, a nephew of theSaint, the child of her sister and Don Juan de Ovalle, was struckby some falling stones and killed.  The workmen took the child tohis mother: and the Saint, then in the house of Doña Guiomar deUlloa, was sent for.  Doña Guiomar took the dead boy into herarms, gave him to the Saint, saying that it was a grievous blowto the father and mother, and that she must obtain his life fromGod.  The Saint took the body, and, laying it in her lap, orderedthose around her to cease their lamentations, of whom her sisterwas naturally the loudest, and be silent.  Then, covering herface and her body with her veil, she prayed to God, and God gavethe child his life again.  The little boy soon after ran up tohis aunt and thanked her for what she had done. In after yearsthe child used to say to the Saint that, as she had deprived himof the bliss of heaven by bringing him back to life, she wasbound to see that he did not suffer loss.  Don Gonzalo died threeyears after St. Teresa, when he was twenty-eight years of age(Reforma, i. c. 42, § 2).17. Psalm xciii. 20: 'Qui fingis laborem in præcepto.'
ISFJ	 XXXVI.The Foundation of the Monastery of St. Joseph.Persecution and Temptations.  Great Interior Trial of the Saint,and Her Deliverance.1. Having now left that city, [1] I travelled in great joy,resolved to suffer most willingly whatever our Lord might bepleased to lay upon me.  On the night of my arrival here, [2]came also from Rome the commission and the Brief for the erectionof the monastery. [3]  I was astonished myself, and so were thosewho knew how our Lord hastened my coming, when they saw hownecessary it was, and in what a moment our Lord had brought meback. [4]  I found here the Bishop and the holy friar, [5] Peterof Alcantara, and that nobleman, [6] the great servant of God, inwhose house the holy man was staying; for he was a man who was inthe habit of receiving the servants of God in his house.These two prevailed on the Bishop to accept the monastery, whichwas no small thing, because it was founded in poverty; but he wasso great a lover of those whom he saw determined to serve ourLord, that he was immediately drawn to give them His protection.It was the approbation of the holy old man, [7] and the greattrouble he took to make now this one, now that one, help us, thatdid the whole work.  If I had not come at the moment, as I havejust said, I do not see how it could have been done; for the holyman was here but a short time,--I think not quite eightdays,--during which he was also ill; and almost immediatelyafterwards our Lord took him to Himself. [8]  It seems as if HisMajesty reserved him till this affair was ended, because now forsome time--I think for more than two years--he had been very ill.2. Everything was done in the utmost secrecy; and if it had notbeen so, I do not see how anything could have been done at all;for the people of the city were against us, as it appearedafterwards.  Our Lord ordained that one of my brothers-in-law [9]should be ill, and his wife away, and himself in such straitsthat my superiors gave me leave to remain with him.Nothing, therefore, was found out, though some persons had theirsuspicions;--still, they did not believe.  It was very wonderful,for his illness lasted only no longer than was necessary for ouraffair; and when it was necessary he should recover his health,that I might be disengaged, and he leave the house empty, ourLord restored him; and he was astonished at it himself. [10]3. I had much trouble in persuading this person and that to allowthe foundation; I had to nurse the sick man, and obtain from theworkmen the hasty preparation of the house, so that it might havethe form of a monastery; but much remained still to be done.My friend was not here, [11] for we thought it best she should beaway, in order the better to hide our purpose.  I saw thateverything depended on haste, for many, reasons, one of which wasthat I was afraid I might be ordered back to my monastery at anymoment.  I was troubled by so many things, that I suspected mycross had been sent me, though it seemed but a light one incomparison with that which I understood our Lord meant meto carry.4. When everything was settled, our Lord was pleased that some ofus should take the habit on St. Bartholomew's Day.  The most HolySacrament began to dwell in the house at the same time. [12]With full sanction and authority, then, our monastery of our mostglorious father St. Joseph was founded in the year 1562. [13]I was there myself to give the habit, with two nuns [14] of thehouse to which we belonged, who happened then to be absent fromit.  As the house which thus became a monastery was that of mybrother-in-law--I said before [15] that he had bought it, for thepurpose of concealing our plan--I was there myself with thepermission of my superiors; and I did nothing without the adviceof learned men, in order that I might not break, in a singlepoint, my vow of obedience.  As these persons considered what Iwas doing to be most advantageous for the whole Order, on manyaccounts, they told me--though I was acting secretly, and takingcare my superiors should know nothing--that I might go on.If they had told me that there was the slightest imperfection inthe whole matter, I would have given up the founding of athousand monasteries,--how much more, then, this one!  I amcertain of this; for though I longed to withdraw from everythingmore and more, and to follow my rule and vocation in the greatESTJerfection and seclusion, yet I wished to do so onlyconditionally: for if I should have learnt that it would be forthe greater honour of our Lord to abandon it, I would have doneso, as I did before on one occasion, [16] in all peaceand contentment.5. I felt as if I were in bliss, when I saw the most HolySacrament reserved, with four poor orphans, [17]--for they werereceived without a dowry,--and great servants of God, establishedin the house.  It was our aim from the beginning to receive onlythose who, by their example, might be the foundation on which wecould build up what we had in view--great perfection andprayer--and effect a work which I believed to be for the serviceof our Lord, and to the honour of the habit of His gloriousMother. This was my anxiety.  It was also a great consolation tome that I had done that which our Lord had so often commanded meto do, and that there was one church more in this city dedicatedto my glorious father St. Joseph.  Not that I thought I had doneanything myself, for I have never thought so, and do not think soeven now; I always looked upon it as the work of our Lord.My part in it was so full of imperfections, that I look uponmyself rather as a person in fault than as one to whom any thanksare due.  But it was a great joy to me when I saw His Majestymake use of me, who am so worthless, as His instrument in sogrand a work.  I was therefore in great joy,--so much so, that Iwas, as it were, beside myself, lost in prayer.6. When all was done--it might have been about three or fourhours afterwards--Satan returned to the spiritual fight againstme, as I shall now relate.  He suggested to me that perhaps I hadbeen wrong in what I had done; perhaps I had failed in myobedience, in having brought it about without the commandment ofthe Provincial.  I did certainly think that the Provincial wouldbe displeased because I had placed the monastery under thejurisdiction of the Bishop [18] without telling him of itbeforehand; though, as he would not acknowledge the monasteryhimself, and as I had not changed mine, it seemed to me thatperhaps he would not care much about the matter.  Satan alsosuggested whether the nuns would be contented to live in sostrict a house, whether they could always find food, whether Ihad not done a silly thing, and what had I to do with it, when Iwas already in a monastery?  All our Lord had said to me, all theopinions I had heard, and all the prayers which had been almostuninterrupted for more than two years, were completely blottedout of my memory, just as if they had never been.  The only thingI remembered was my own opinion; and every virtue, with faithitself, was then suspended within me, so that I was withoutstrength to practise any one of them, or to defend myself againstso many blows.7. The devil also would have me ask myself how I could think ofshutting myself up in so strict a house, when I was subject to somany infirmities; how could I bear so penitential a life, andleave a house large and pleasant, where I had been always sohappy, and where I had so many friends?--perhaps I might not likethose of the new monastery; I had taken on myself a heavyobligation, and might possibly end in despair.  He also suggestedthat perhaps it was he himself who had contrived it, in order torob me of my peace and rest, so that, being unable to pray, Imight be disquieted, and so lose my soul.  Thoughts of this kindhe put before me; and they were so many, that I could think ofnothing else; and with them came such distress, obscurity, anddarkness of soul as I can never describe.  When I found myself inthis state, I went and placed myself before the most HolySacrament, though I could not pray to Him; so great was myanguish, that I was like one in the agony of death.  I could notmake the matter known to any one, because no confessor had as yetbeen appointed.8. O my God, how wretched is this life!  No joy is lasting;everything is liable to change.  Only a moment ago, I do notthink I would have exchanged my joy with any man upon earth; andthe very grounds of that joy so tormented me now, that I knew notwhat to do with myself.  Oh, if we did but consider carefully theevents of our life, every one of us would learn from experiencehow little we ought to make either of its pleasures or of itspains!  Certainly this was, I believe, one of the mostdistressing moments I ever passed in all my life; my spiritseemed to forecast the great sufferings in store for me, thoughthey never were so heavy as this was, if it had continued.But our Lord would not let His poor servant suffer, for in all mytroubles He never failed to succour me; so it was now.  He gaveme a little light, so that I might see it was the work of thedevil, and might understand the truth,--namely, that it wasnothing else but an attempt on his part to frighten me with hislies.  So I began to call to mind my great resolutions to serveour Lord, and my desire to suffer for His sake; and I thoughtthat if I carried them out, I must not seek to be at rest; thatif I had my trials, they would be meritorious; and that if I hadtroubles, and endured them in order to please God, it would serveme for purgatory.  What was I, then, afraid of?  If I longed fortribulations, I had them now; and my gain lay in the greatestopposition.  Why, then, did I fail in courage to serve One towhom I owed so much?9. After making these and other reflections, and doing greatviolence to myself, I promised before the most Holy Sacrament todo all in my power to obtain permission to enter this house, and,if I could do it with a good conscience, to make a vow ofenclosure.  When I had done this, the devil fled in a moment, andleft me calm and peaceful, and I have continued so ever since;and the enclosure, penances, and other rules of this house are tome, in their observance, so singularly sweet and light, the joy Ihave is so exceedingly great, that I am now and then thinkingwhat on earth I could have chosen which should be moredelightful.  I know not whether this may not be the cause of mybeing in better health than I was ever before, or whether it bethat our Lord, because it is needful and reasonable that I shoulddo as all the others do, gives me this comfort of keeping thewhole rule, though with some difficulty.  However, all who knowmy infirmities, are astonished at my strength.  Blessed be He whogiveth it all, and in whose strength I am strong!10. Such a contest left me greatly fatigued, and laughing atSatan; for I saw clearly it was he.  As I have never known whatit is to be discontented because I am a nun--no, not for aninstant--during more than twenty-eight years of religion, Ibelieve that our Lord suffered me to be thus tempted, that Imight understand how great a mercy He had shown me herein, andfrom what torment He had delivered me, and that if I saw any onein like trouble I might not be alarmed at it, but have pity onher, and be able to console her.11. Then, when this was over, I wished to rest myself a littleafter our dinner; for during the whole of that night I hadscarcely rested at all, and for some nights previously I had hadmuch trouble and anxiety, while every day was full of toil; forthe news of what we had done had reached my monastery, and wasspread through the city.  There arose a great outcry, for thereasons I mentioned before, [19] and there was some apparentground for it.  The prioress [20] sent for me to come to herimmediately.  When I received the order, I went at once, leavingthe nuns in great distress.  I saw clearly enough that there weretroubles before me; but as the work was really done, I did notcare much for that.  I prayed and implored our Lord to help me,and my father St. Joseph to bring me back to his house.I offered up to him all I was to suffer, rejoicing greatly that Ihad the opportunity of suffering for his honour and of doing himservice.  I went persuaded that I should be put in prison at oncebut this would have been a great comfort, because I should havenobody to speak to, and might have some rest and solitude, ofwhich I was in great need; for so much intercourse with peoplehad worn me out.12. When I came and told the prioress what I had done, she wassoftened a little.  They all sent for the Provincial, and thematter was reserved for him.  When he came, I was summoned tojudgment, rejoicing greatly at seeing that I had something tosuffer for our Lord.  I did not think I had offended against HisMajesty, or against my Order, in anything I had done; on thecontrary, I was striving with all my might to exalt my Order, forwhich I would willingly have died,--for my whole desire was thatits rule might be observed in all perfection.  I thought ofChrist receiving sentence, and I saw how this of mine would beless than nothing.  I confessed my fault, as if I had been verymuch to blame; and so I seemed to every one who did not know allthe reasons.  After the Provincial had rebuked me sharply--thoughnot with the severity which my fault deserved, nor according tothe representations made to him--I would not defend myself, for Iwas determined to bear it all; on the contrary, I prayed him toforgive and punish, and be no longer angry with me.13. I saw well enough that they condemned me on some charges ofwhich I was innocent, for they said I had founded the monasterythat I might be thought much of, and to make myself a name, andfor other reasons of that kind.  But on other points I understoodclearly that they were speaking the truth, as when they said thatI was more wicked than the other nuns.  They asked, how could I,who had not kept the rule in that house, think of keeping it inanother of stricter observance?  They said I was giving scandalin the city, and setting up novelties.  All this neither troublednor distressed me in the least, though I did seem to feel it,lest I should appear to make light of what they were saying.14. At last the Provincial commanded me to explain my conductbefore the nuns, and I had to do it.  As I was perfectly calm,and our Lord helped me, I explained everything in such a way thatneither the Provincial nor those who were present found anyreason to condemn me.  Afterwards I spoke more plainly to theProvincial alone; he was very much satisfied, and promised, ifthe new monastery prospered, and the city became quiet, to giveme leave to live in it.  Now the outcry in the city was verygreat, as I am going to tell.  Two or three days after this, thegovernor, certain members of the council of the city and of the
ISFJ	, came together, and resolved that the new monasteryshould not be allowed to exist, that it was a visible wrong tothe state, that the most Holy Sacrament should be removed, andthat they would not suffer us to go on with our work.15. They assembled all the Orders--that is, two learned men fromeach--to give their opinion.  Some were silent, others condemned;in the end, they resolved that the monastery should be broken up.Only one [21]--he was of the Order of St. Dominic, and objected,not to the monastery itself, but to the foundation of it inpoverty--said that there was no reason why it should be thusdissolved, that the matter ought to be well considered, thatthere was time enough, that it was the affair of the bishop, withother things of that kind.  This was of great service to us, forthey were angry enough to proceed to its destruction at once, andit was fortunate they did not.  In short, the monastery mustexist; our Lord was pleased to have it, and all of them could donothing against His will.  They gave their reasons, and showedtheir zeal for good, and thus, without offending God, made mesuffer together with all those who were in favour of themonastery; there were not many, but they suffered muchpersecution.  The inhabitants were so excited, that they talkedof nothing else; every one condemned me, and hurried to theProvincial and to my monastery.16. I was no more distressed by what they said of me than if theyhad said nothing; but I was afraid the monastery would bedestroyed: that was painful; so also was it to see those personswho helped me lose their credit and suffer so much annoyance.But as to what was said of myself I was rather glad, and if I hadhad any faith I should not have been troubled at all.  But aslight failing in one virtue is enough to put all the others tosleep. I was therefore extremely distressed during the two dayson which those assemblies of which I have spoken were held.In the extremity of my trouble, our Lord said to me: 'Knowestthou not that I am the Almighty? what art thou afraid of?'He made me feel assured that the monastery would not be brokenup, and I was exceedingly comforted.  The informations taken weresent up to the king's council, and an order came back for areport on the whole matter.17. Here was the beginning of a grand lawsuit: the city sentdelegates to the court, and some must be sent also to defend themonastery: but I had no money, nor did I know what to do.Our Lord provided for us for the Father Provincial never orderedme not to meddle in the matter.  He is so great a lover of allthat is good, that, though he did not help us, he would not beagainst our work.  Neither did he authorise me to enter the housetill he saw how it would end.  Those servants of God who were init were left alone, and did more by their prayers than I did withall my negotiations, though the affair needed the utmostattention.  Now and then everything seemed to fail; particularlyone day, before the Provincial came, when the prioress ordered meto meddle no more with it, and to give it up altogether.I betook myself to God, and said, 'O Lord, this house is notmine; it was founded for Thee; and now that there is no one totake up the cause, do Thou protect it.'  I now felt myself inpeace, and as free from anxiety as if the whole world were on myside in the matter; and at once I looked upon it as safe. [22]18. A very great servant of God, and a lover of all perfection, apriest [23] who had helped me always, went to the court on thisbusiness, and took great pains.  That holy nobleman [24] of whomI have often spoken laboured much on our behalf, and helped us inevery way.  He had much trouble and persecution to endure, and Ialways found a father in him, and do so still.  All those whohelped us, our Lord filled with such fervour as made themconsider our affair as their own, as if their own life andreputation were at stake; and yet it was nothing to them, exceptin so far as it regarded the service of our Lord.  His Majestyvisibly helped the priest I have spoken of before, [25] who wasalso one of those who gave us great help when the Bishop sent himas his representative to one of the great meetings.  There hestood alone against all; at last he pacified them by means ofcertain propositions, which obtained us a little respite.But that was not enough; for they were ready to spend theirlives, if they could but destroy the monastery.  This servant ofGod was he who gave the habit and reserved the most HolySacrament, and he was the object of much persecution.This attack lasted about six months: to relate in detail theheavy trials we passed through would be too tedious.19. I wondered at what Satan did against a few poor women, andalso how all people thought that merely twelve women, with aprioress, could be so hurtful to the city,--for they were not tobe more,--I say this to those who opposed us,--and living suchaustere lives; for if any harm or error came of it, it would allfall upon them.  Harm to the city there could not be in any way;and yet the people thought there was so much in it, that theyopposed us with a good conscience.  At last they resolved theywould tolerate us if we were endowed, and in consideration ofthat would suffer us to remain.  I was so distressed at thetrouble of all those who were on our side--more than at myown--that I thought it would not be amiss, till the people werepacified, to accept an endowment, but afterwards to resign it.At other times, too, wicked and imperfect as I am, I thought thatperhaps our Lord wished it to be so, seeing that, withoutaccepting it, we could not succeed; and so I consented tothe compromise.20. The night before the settlement was to be made, I was inprayer,--the discussion of the terms of it had alreadybegun,--when our Lord said to me that I must do nothing of thekind; for if we began with an endowment, they would never allowus to resign it.  He said some other things also.  The samenight, the holy friar, Peter of Alcantara, appeared to me.He was then dead. [26]  But he had written to me before hisdeath--for he knew the great opposition and persecution we had tobear--that he was glad the foundation was so much spoken against;it was a sign that our Lord would be exceedingly honoured in themonastery, seeing that Satan was so earnest against it; and thatI was by no means to consent to an endowment.  He urged this uponme twice or thrice in that letter, and said that if I persistedin this everything would succeed according to my wish.21. At this time I had already seen him twice since his death,and the great glory he was in, and so I was not afraid,--on thecontrary, I was very glad; for he always appeared as a glorifiedbody in great happiness, and the vision made me very happy too.I remember that he told me, the first time I saw him, among otherthings, when speaking of the greatness of his joy, that thepenance he had done was a blessed thing for him, in that it hadobtained so great a reward.  But, as I think I have spoken ofthis before, [27] I will now say no more than that he showedhimself severe on this occasion: he merely said that I was on noaccount to accept an endowment, and asked why it was I did nottake his advice.  He then disappeared. I remained inastonishment, and the next day told the nobleman--for I went tohim in all my trouble, as to one who did more than others for usin the matter,--what had taken place, and charged him not toconsent to the endowment, but to let the lawsuit go on.  He wasmore firm on this point than I was, and was therefore greatlypleased; he told me afterwards how much he dislikedthe compromise.22. After this, another personage--a great servant of God, andwith good intentions--came forward, who, now that the matter wasin good train, advised us to put it in the hands of learned men.This brought on trouble enough; for some of those who helped meagreed to do so; and this plot of Satan was one of the mostdifficult of all to unravel.  Our Lord was my helper throughout.Writing thus briefly, it is impossible for me to explain whattook place during the two years that passed between the beginningand the completion of the monastery: the last six months and thefirst six months were the most painful.23. When at last the city was somewhat calm, the licentiatefather, the Dominican friar [28] who helped us, exerted himselfmost skilfully on our behalf.  Though not here at the time, ourLord brought him here at a most convenient moment for ourservice, and it seems that His Majesty brought him for thatpurpose only.  He told me afterwards that he had no reasons forcoming, and that he heard of our affair as if by chance.He remained here as long as we wanted him, and on going away heprevailed, by some means, on the Father Provincial to permit meto enter this house, and to take with me some of thenuns [29]--such a permission seemed impossible in so short a timefor the performance of the Divine Office--and the training ofthose who were in this house: the day of our coming was a mostjoyful day for me. [30]24. While praying in the church, before I went into the house,and being as it were in a trance, I saw Christ; who, as it seemedto me, received me with great affection, placed a crown on myhead, and thanked me for what I had done for His Mother.On another occasion, when all of us remained in the choir inprayer after Compline, I saw our Lady in exceeding glory, in awhite mantle, with which she seemed to cover us all.I understood by that the high degree of glory to which our Lordwould raise the religious of this house.25. When we had begun to sing the Office, the people began tohave a great devotion to the monastery; more nuns were received,and our Lord began to stir up those who had been our greatESTJersecutors to become great benefactors, and give alms to us.In this way they came to approve of what they had condemned; andso, by degrees, they withdrew from the lawsuit, and would saythat they now felt it to be a work of God, since His Majesty hadbeen pleased to carry it on in the face of so much opposition.And now there is not one who thinks that it would have been rightnot to have founded the monastery: so they make a point offurnishing us with alms; for without any asking on our part,without begging of any one, our Lord moves them to, succour us;and so we always have what is necessary for us, and I trust inour Lord it will always be so. [31]  As the sisters are few innumber, if they do their duty as our Lord at present by His graceenables them to do, I am confident that they will always have it,and that they need not be a burden nor troublesome to anybody;for our Lord will care for them, as He has hitherto done.26. It is the greatest consolation to me to find myself amongthose who are so detached.  Their occupation is to learn how theymay advance in the service of God.  Solitude is their delight;and the thought of being visited by any one, even of theirnearest kindred, is a trial, unless it helps them to kindle moreand more their love of the Bridegroom.  Accordingly, none come tothis house who do not aim at this; otherwise they neither givenor receive any pleasure from their visits.  Their conversationis of God only; and so he whose conversation is different doesnot understand them, and they do not understand him.27. We keep the rule of our Lady of Carmel, not the rule of theMitigation, but as it was settled by Fr. Hugo, Cardinal of SantaSabina, and given in the year 1248, in the fifth year of thepontificate of Innocent IV., Pope.  All the trouble we had to gothrough, as it seems to me, will have been endured togood purpose.28. And now, though the rule be somewhat severe,--for we nevereat flesh except in cases of necessity, fast eight months in theyear, and practise some other austerities besides, according tothe primitive rule, [32]--yet the sisters think it light on manypoints, and so they have other observances, which we have thoughtnecessary for the more perfect keeping of it.  And I trust in ourLord that what we have begun will prosper more and more,according to the promise of His Majesty.29. The other house, which the holy woman of whom I spokebefore [33] laboured to establish, has been also blessed of ourLord, and is founded in Alcala: it did not escape seriousopposition, nor fail to endure many trials.  I know that allduties of religion are observed in it, according to our primitiverule.  Our Lord grant that all may be to the praise and glory ofHimself and of the glorious Virgin Mary, whose habit wewear.  Amen.30. I think you must be wearied, my father, by the tedioushistory of this monastery; and yet it is most concise, if youcompare it with our labours, and the wonders which our Lord haswrought here.  There are many who can bear witness to this onoath.  I therefore beg of your reverence, for the love of God,should you think fit to destroy the rest of this my writing, topreserve that part of it which relates to this monastery, andgive it, when I am dead, to the sisters who may then be living init.  It will encourage them greatly, who shall come here both toserve God and to labour, that what has been thus begun may notfall to decay, but ever grow and thrive, when they see how muchour Lord has done through one so mean and vile as I.  As our Lordhas been so particularly gracious to us in the foundation of thishouse it seems to me that she will do very wrong, and that shewill be heavily chastised of God, who shall be the first to relaxthe perfect observance of the rule, which our Lord has here begunand countenanced, so that it may be kept with so much sweetness:it is most evident that the observance of it is easy, and that itcan be kept with ease, by the arrangement made for those who longto be alone with their Bridegroom Christ, in order to live forever in Him.31. This is to be the perpetual aim of those who are here, to bealone with Him alone.  They are not to be more in number thanthirteen: I know this number to be the best, for I have had manyopinions about it; and I have seen in my own experience, that topreserve our spirit, living on alms, without asking of anyone, alarger number would be inexpedient.  May they always believe onewho with much labour, and by the prayers of many people,accomplished that which must be for the best!  That this is mostexpedient for us will be seen from the joy and cheerfulness, andthe few troubles, we have all had in the years we have lived inthis house, as well as from the better health than usual of usall.  If any one thinks the rule hard, let her lay the fault onher want of the true spirit, and not on the rule of the house,seeing that delicate persons, and those not saints,--because theyhave the true spirit,--can bear it all with so much sweetness.Let others go to another monastery, where they may save theirsouls in the way of their own spirit.1.

The bell which the Saint had provided for the convent weighedless than three pounds, and remained in the monastery for ahundred years, till it was sent, by order of the General, to themonastery of Pastrana, where the general chapters were held.There the friars assembled at the sound of the bell, which rangfor the first Mass of the Carmelite Reform (Reforma,i. c. xlvi. § 1).14. They were Doña Ines and Doña Ana de Tapia, cousins of theSaint.  There were present also Don Gonzalo de Aranda, DonFrancisco Salcedo, Julian of Avila, priest; Doña Juana deAhumada, the Saint's sister; with her husband, Juan de Ovalle.The Saint herself retained her own habit, making no change,because she had not the permission of her superiors (Reforma,i. c. xlvi. § 2).15.

At this time Bañesdid not know, and had never seen, the Saint; he undertook herdefence simply because he saw that her intentions were good, andthe means she made use of for founding the monastery lawful,seeing that she had received the commandment to do so from thePope. Bañes testifies thus in the depositions made in Salamancain 1591 in the Saint's process.  See vol. ii. p. 376 of DonVicente's edition.22. See Ch. xxxix. § 25.23. Gonzalo de Aranda (De la Fuente).24.

St. Teresa was a simple nun, living under obedience tothe prioress of St. Joseph, Ana of St. John, and intended so toremain.

Maria of Jesus had founded her house inAlcala de Henares; but the austerities practised in it, and theabsence of the religious mitigations which long experience hadintroduced, were too much for the fervent nuns there assembled.Maria of Jesus begged Doña Leonor de Mascareñas to persuadeSt. Teresa to come to Alcala.  The Saint went to the monastery,and was received there with joy, and even entreated to take thehouse under her own government (Reforma, ii. c. x. §§ 3, 4).
ISFJ	 XXXVII.The Effects of the Divine Graces in the Soul.  The InestimableGreatness of One Degree of Glory.1. It is painful to me to recount more of the graces which ourLord gave me than these already spoken of; and they are so many,that nobody can believe they were ever given to one so wicked:but in obedience to our Lord, who has commanded me to do it, [1]and you, my fathers, I will speak of some of them to His glory.May it please His Majesty it may be to the profit of some soul!For if our Lord has been thus gracious to so--miserable a thingas myself, what will He be to those who shall serve Him truly?Let all people resolve to please His Majesty, seeing that Hegives such pledges as these even in this life. [2]2. In the first place, it must be understood that, in thosegraces which God bestows on the soul, there are diverse degreesof joy: for in some visions the joy and sweetness and comfort ofthem so far exceed those of others, that I am amazed at thedifferent degrees of fruition even in this life; for it happensthat the joy and consolation which God gives in a vision or atrance are so different, that it seems impossible for the soul tobe able to desire anything more in this world: and, so, in fact,the soul does not desire, nor would it ask for, a greater joy.Still, since our Lord has made me understand how great adifference there is in heaven itself between the fruition of oneand that of another, I see clearly enough that here also, whenour Lord wills, He gives not by measure; [3] and so I wish that Imyself observed no measure in serving His Majesty, and in usingmy whole life and strength and health therein; and I would nothave any fault of mine rob me of the slightest degreeof fruition.3. And so I say that if I were asked which I preferred, to endureall the trials of the world until the end of it, and then receiveone slight degree of glory additional, or without any sufferingof any kind to enter into glory of a slightly lower degree, Iwould accept--oh, how willingly!--all those trials for one slightdegree of fruition in the contemplation of the greatness of God;for I know that he who understands Him best, loves Him andpraises Him best.  I do not mean that I should not be satisfied,and consider myself most blessed, to be in heaven, even if Ishould be in the lowest place; for as I am one who had that placein hell, it would be a great mercy of our Lord to admit me atall; and may it please His Majesty to bring me thither, and takeaway His eyes from beholding my grievous sins. What I mean isthis,--if it were in my power, even if it cost me everything, andour Lord gave me the grace to endure much affliction, I would notthrough any fault of mine lose one degree of glory.  Ah, wretchedthat I am, who by so many faults had forfeited all!4. It is also to be observed that, in every vision or revelationwhich our Lord in His mercy sent me, a great gain accrued to mysoul, and that in some of the visions this gain was very great.The vision of Christ left behind an impression of His exceedingbeauty, and it remains with me to this day.  One vision alone ofHim is enough to effect this; what, then, must all those visionshave done, which our Lord in His mercy sent me? One exceedinglygreat blessing has resulted therefrom, and it is this,--I had onevery grievous fault, which was the source of much evil; namely,whenever I found anybody well disposed towards myself, and Iliked him, I used to have such an affection for him as compelledme always to remember and think of him, though I had no intentionof offending God: however, I was pleased to see him, to think ofhim and of his good qualities.  All this was so hurtful, that itbrought my soul to the very verge of destruction.5. But ever since I saw the great beauty [4] of our Lord, I neversaw any one who in comparison with Him seemed even endurable, orthat could occupy my thoughts.  For if I but turn mine eyesinwardly for a moment to the contemplation of the image which Ihave within me, I find myself so free, that from that instanteverything I see is loathsome in comparison with the excellencesand graces of which I had a vision in our Lord.  Neither is thereany sweetness, nor any kind of pleasure, which I can make anyaccount of, compared with that which comes from hearing but oneword from His divine mouth.  What, then, must it be when I hearso many?  I look upon it as impossible--unless our Lord, for mysins, should permit the loss of this remembrance--that I shouldhave the power to occupy myself with anything in such a way asthat I should not instantly recover my liberty by thinking ofour Lord.6. This has happened to me with some of my confessors, for Ialways have a great affection for those who have the direction ofmy soul.  As I really saw in them only the representatives ofGod, I thought my will was always there where it is mostoccupied; and as I felt very safe in the matter, I always showedmyself glad to see them. [5]  They, on the other hand, servantsof God, and fearing Him, were afraid that I was attaching andbinding myself too much to them, though in a holy way, andtreated me with rudeness.  This took place after I had become soready to obey them; for before that time I had no affectionwhatever for them.  I used to laugh to myself, when I saw howmuch they were deceived.  Though I was not always putting beforethem how little I was attached to anybody, as clearly as I wasconvinced of it myself, yet I did assure them of it; and they, intheir further relations with me, acknowledged how much I owed toour Lord in the matter.  These suspicions of me always arose inthe beginning.7. My love of, and trust in, our Lord, after I had seen Him in avision, began to grow, for my converse with Him was so continual.I saw that, though He was God, He was man also; that He is notsurprised at the frailties of men, that He understands ourmiserable nature, liable to fall continually, because of thefirst sin, for the reparation of which He had come.  I couldspeak to Him as to a friend, though He is my Lord, because I donot consider Him as one of our earthly Lords, who affect a powerthey do not possess, who give audience at fixed hours, and towhom only certain persons may speak.  If a poor man have anybusiness with these, it will cost him many goings and comings,and currying favour with others, together with much pain andlabour before he can speak to them.  Ah, if such a one hasbusiness with a king!  Poor people, not of gentle blood, cannotapproach him, for they must apply to those who are his friends,and certainly these are not persons who tread the world undertheir feet; for they who do this speak the truth, fear nothing,and ought to fear nothing; they are not courtiers, because it isnot the custom of a court, where they must be silent about thosethings they dislike, must not even dare to think about them, lestthey should fall into disgrace.8. O King of glory, and Lord of all kings! oh, how Thy kinglydignity is not hedged about by trifles of this kind!  Thy kingdomis for ever.  We do not require chamberlains to introduce us intoThy presence.  The very vision of Thy person shows us at oncethat Thou alone art to be called Lord.  Thy Majesty is somanifest that there is no need of a retinue or guard to make usconfess that Thou art King.  An earthly king without attendantswould be hardly acknowledged; and though he might wish ever somuch to be recognised, people will not own him when he appears asothers; it is necessary that his dignity should be visible, ifpeople are to believe in it.  This is reason enough why kingsshould affect so much state; for if they had none, no one wouldrespect them; this their semblance of power is not in themselves,and their authority must come to them from others.9. O my Lord!  O my King! who can describe Thy Majesty?  It isimpossible not to see that Thou art Thyself the great Ruler ofall, that the beholding of Thy Majesty fills men with awe.  But Iam filled with greater awe, O my Lord, when I consider Thyhumility, and the love Thou hast for such as I am.  We canconverse and speak with Thee about everything whenever we will;and when we lose our first fear and awe at the vision of ThyMajesty, we have a greater dread of offending Thee,--not arisingout of the fear of punishment, O my Lord, for that is as nothingin comparison with the loss of Thee!10. Thus far of the blessings of this vision, without speaking ofothers, which abide in the soul when it is past.  If it be fromGod, the fruits thereof show it, when the soul receives light;for, as I have often said, [6] the will of our Lord is that thesoul should be in darkness, and not see this light.  It is,therefore, nothing to be wondered at that I, knowing myself to beso wicked as I am, should be afraid.11. It is only just now it happened to me to be for eight days ina state wherein it seemed that I did not, and could not, confessmy obligations to God, or remember His mercies; but my soul wasso stupefied, and occupied with I know not what nor how: not thatI had any bad thoughts; only I was so incapable of good thoughts,that I was laughing at myself, and even rejoicing to see how meana soul can be if God is not always working in it. [7]  The soulsees clearly that God is not away from it in this state, and thatit is not in those  great tribulations which I have spoken of asbeing occasionally mine.  Though it heaps up fuel, and does thelittle it can do of itself, it cannot make the fire of the loveof God burn: it is a great mercy that even the smoke is visible,showing that it is not altogether quenched.  Our Lord will returnand kindle it; and until then the soul--though it may lose itsbreath in blowing and arranging the fuel--seems to be doingnothing but putting it out more and more.12. I believe that now the best course is to be absolutelyresigned, confessing that we can do nothing, and so applyourselves--as I said before [8]--to something else which ismeritorious.  Our Lord, it may be, takes away from the soul thepower of praying, that it may betake itself to something else,and learn by experience how little it can do in its own strength.13. It is true I have this day been rejoicing in our Lord, andhave dared to complain of His Majesty.  I said unto Him: How isit, O my God, that it is not enough for Thee to detain me in thiswretched life, and that I should have to bear with it for thelove of Thee, and be willing to live where everything hinders thefruition of Thee; where, besides, I must eat and sleep, transactbusiness, and converse with every one, and all for Thy love? howis it, then,--for Thou well knowest, O my Lord, all this to bethe greatest torment unto me,--that, in the rare moments when Iam with Thee, Thou hidest Thyself from me?  How is thisconsistent with Thy compassion?  How can that love Thou hast forme endure this?  I believe, O Lord, if it were possible for me tohide myself from Thee, as Thou hidest Thyself from me--I thinkand believe so--such is Thy love, that Thou wouldest not endureit at my hands.  But Thou art with me, and seest me always.  O myLord, I beseech Thee look to this; it must not be; a wrong isdone to one who loves Thee so much.14. I happened to utter these words, and others of the same kind,when I should have been thinking rather how my place in hell waspleasant in comparison with the place I deserved.  But now andthen my love makes me foolish, so that I lose my senses; only itis with all the sense I have that I make these complaints, andour Lord bears it all.  Blessed be so good a King!15. Can we be thus bold with the kings of this world?  And yet Iam not surprised that we dare not thus speak to a king, for it isonly reasonable that men should be afraid of him, or even to thegreat lords who are his representatives.  The world is now cometo such a state, that men's lives ought to be longer than theyare if we are to learn all the new customs and ceremonies of goodbreeding, and yet spend any time in the service of God.  I blessmyself at the sight of what is going on.  The fact is, I did notknow how I was to live when I came into this house.Any negligence in being much more ceremonious with people thanthey deserve is not taken as a jest; on the contrary, they lookupon it as an insult deliberately offered; so that it becomesnecessary for you to satisfy them of your good intentions, ifthere happens, as I have said, to have been any negligence; andeven then, God grant they may believe you.16. I repeat it,--I certainly did not know how to live; for mypoor soul was worn out.  It is told to employ all its thoughtsalways on God, and that it is necessary to do so if it wouldavoid many dangers.  On the other hand, it finds it will not doto fail in any one point of the world's law, under the penalty ofaffronting those who look upon these things as touching theirhonour.  I was worn out in unceasingly giving satisfaction topeople; for, though I tried my utmost, I could not help failingin many ways in matters which, as I have said, are not slightlythought of in the world.17. Is it true that in religious houses no explanations arenecessary, for it is only reasonable we should be excused theseobservances?  Well, that is not so; for there are people who saythat monasteries ought to be courts in politeness andinstruction.  I certainly cannot understand it.  I thought thatperhaps some saint may have said that they ought to be courts toteach those who wish to be the courtiers of heaven, and thatthese people misunderstood their meaning; for if a man be carefulto please God continually, and to hate the world, as he ought todo, I do not see how he can be equally careful to please thosewho live in the world in these matters which are continuallychanging.  If they could be learnt once for all, it might beborne with: but as to the way of addressing letters, there oughtto be a professor's chair founded, from which lectures should begiven, so to speak, teaching us how to do it; for the papershould on one occasion be left blank in one corner, and onanother in another corner; and a man must be addressed as theillustrious who was not hitherto addressed as the magnificent.18. I know not where this will stop: I am not yet fifty, and yetI have seen so many changes during my life, that I do not knowhow to live.  What will they do who are only just born, and whomay live many years?  Certainly I am sorry for those spiritualpeople who, for certain holy purposes, are obliged to live in theworld; the cross they have to carry is a dreadful one.  If theycould all agree together, and make themselves ignorant, and bewilling to be considered so in these sciences, they would setthemselves free from much trouble.  But what folly am I about!from speaking of the greatness of God I am come to speak of themeanness of the world!  Since our Lord has given me the grace toquit it, I wish to leave it altogether.   Let them settle thesematters who maintain these follies with so much labour.God grant that in the next life, where there is no changing, wemay not have to pay for them!  Amen.1.

ISFJ	 XXXVIII.Certain Heavenly Secrets, Visions, and Revelations.  The Effectsof Them in Her Soul.1. One night I was so unwell that I thought I might be excusedmaking my prayer; so I took my rosary, that I might employ myselfin vocal prayer, trying not to be recollected in myunderstanding, though outwardly I was recollected, being in myoratory.  These little precautions are of no use when our Lordwill have it otherwise.  I remained there but a few moments thus,when I was rapt in spirit with such violence that I could make noresistance whatever.  It seemed to me that I was taken up toheaven; and the first persons I saw there were my father and mymother.  I saw other things also; but the time was no longer thanthat in which the Ave Maria might be said, and I was amazed atit, looking on it all as too great a grace for me.  But as to theshortness of the time, it might have been longer, only it was alldone in a very short space.2. I was afraid it might be an illusion; but as I did not thinkso, I knew not what to do, because I was very much ashamed to goto my confessor about it.  It was not, as it seemed to me,because I was humble, but because I thought he would laugh at me,and say: Oh, what a St. Paul!--she sees the things of heaven; ora St. Jerome.  And because these glorious Saints had had suchvisions, I was so much the more afraid, and did nothing but cry;for I did not think it possible for me to see what they saw.At last, though I felt it exceedingly, I went to my confessor;for I never dared to keep secret anything of this kind, howevermuch it distressed me to speak of them, owing to the great fear Ihad of being deceived.  When my confessor saw how much I wassuffering, he consoled me greatly, and gave me plenty of goodreasons why I should have no fear.3. It happened, also, as time went on, and it happens now fromtime to time, that our Lord showed me still greater secrets.The soul, even if it would, has neither the means not the powerto see more than what He shows it; and so, each time, I sawnothing more than what our Lord was pleased to let me see.But such was the vision, that the least part of it was enough tomake my soul amazed, and to raise it so high that it esteems andcounts as nothing all the things of this life.  I wish I coulddescribe, in some measure, the smallest portion of what I saw;but when I think of doing it, I find it impossible; for the meredifference alone between the light we have here below, and thatwhich is seen in a vision,--both being light,--is so great, thatthere is no comparison between them; the brightness of the sunitself seems to be something exceedingly loathsome.  In a word,the imagination, however strong it may be, can neither conceivenor picture to itself this light, nor any one of the things whichour Lord showed me in a joy so supreme that it cannot bedescribed; for then all the senses exult so deeply and so sweetlythat no description is possible; and so it is better to saynothing more.4. I was in this state once for more than an hour, our Lordshowing me wonderful things.  He seemed as if He would not leaveme.  He said to me, 'See, My daughter, what they lose who areagainst Me; do not fail to tell them of it.'  Ah, my Lord, howlittle good my words will do them, who are made blind by theirown conduct, if Thy Majesty will not give them light!  Some, towhom Thou hast given it, there are, who have profited by theknowledge of Thy greatness; but as they see it revealed to one sowicked and base as I am, I look upon it as a great thing if thereshould be any found to believe me.  Blessed be Thy name, andblessed be Thy compassion; for I can trace, at least in my ownsoul, a visible improvement.  Afterwards I wished I had continuedin that trance for ever, and that I had not returned toconsciousness, because of an abiding sense of contempt foreverything here below; all seemed to be filth; and I see howmeanly we employ ourselves who are detained on earth.5. When I was staying with that lady of whom I have beenspeaking, [1] it happened to me once when I was suffering from myheart,--for, as I have said, [2] I suffered greatly at one time,though not so much now,--that she, being a person of greatcharity, brought out her jewels set in gold, and precious stonesof great price, and particularly a diamond, which she valued verymuch.  She thought this might amuse me; but I laughed to myself,and was very sorry to see what men made much of; for I thought ofwhat our Lord had laid up for us, and considered how impossibleit was for me, even if I made the effort, to have anyappreciation whatever of such things, provided our Lord did notpermit me to forget what He was keeping for us.6. A soul in this state attains to a certain freedom, which is socomplete that none can understand it who does not possess it.It is a real and true detachment, independent of our efforts; Godeffects it all Himself; for His Majesty reveals the truth in sucha way, that it remains so deeply impressed on our souls as tomake it clear that we of ourselves could not thus acquire it inso short a time.7. The fear of death, also, was now very slight in me, who hadalways been in great dread of it; now it seems to me that deathis a very light thing for one who serves God, because the soul isin a moment delivered thereby out of its prison, and at rest.This elevation of the spirit, and the vision of things so high,in these trances seem to me to have a great likeness to theflight of the soul from the body, in that it finds itself in amoment in the possession of these good things.  We put aside theagonies of its dissolution, of which no great account is to bemade; for they who love God in truth, and are utterly detachedfrom the things of this life, must die with thegreater sweetness.8. It seems to me, also, that the rapture was a great help torecognise our true home, and to see that we are pilgrimshere; [3] it is a great thing to see what is going on there andto know where we have to live; for if a person has to go andsettle in another country, it is a great help to him, inundergoing the fatigues of his journey, that he has discovered itto be a country where he may live in the most perfect peace.Moreover, it makes it easy for us to think of the things ofheaven, and to have our conversation there. [4]  It is a greatgain, because the mere looking up to heaven makes the soulrecollected; for as our Lord has been pleased to reveal heaven insome degree, my soul dwells upon it in thought; and it happensoccasionally that they who are about me, and with whom I findconsolation, are those whom I know to be living in heaven, andthat I look upon them only as really alive; while those who areon earth are so dead, that the whole world seems unable tofurnish me with companions, particularly when these impetuositiesof love are upon me. Everything seems a dream, and what I seewith the bodily eyes an illusion.  What I have seen with the eyesof the soul is that which my soul desires; and as it finds itselffar away from those things, that is death.9. In a word, it is a very great mercy which our Lord gives tothat soul to which He grants the like visions, for they help itin much, and also in carrying a heavy cross, since nothingsatisfies it, and everything is against it; and if our Lord didnot now and then suffer these visions to be forgotten, thoughthey recur again and again to the memory, I know not how lifecould be borne.  May He be blessed and praised for ever and ever!I implore His Majesty by that Blood which His Son shed for me,now that, of His good pleasure, I know something of these greatblessings, and begin to have the fruition of them, that it maynot be with me as it was with Lucifer, who by his own faultforfeited it all.  I beseech Thee, for Thine own sake, not tosuffer this; for I am at times in great fear, though at others,and most frequently, the mercy of God reassures me, for He whohas delivered me from so many sins will not withdraw His handfrom under me, and let me be lost.  I pray you, my father, to begthis grace for me always.10. The mercies, then, hitherto described, are not, in myopinion, so great as those which I am now going to speak of, onmany accounts, because of the great blessings they have broughtwith them, and because of the great fortitude which my soulderived from them; and yet every one separately considered is sogreat, that there is nothing to be compared with them.11. One day--it was the eve of Pentecost--I went after Mass to avery lonely spot, where I used to pray very often, and began toread about the feast in the book of a Carthusian; [5] and readingof the marks by which beginners, proficients, and the perfect mayknow that they have the Holy Ghost, it seemed to me, when I hadread of these three states, that by the goodness of God, so faras I could understand, the Holy Ghost was with me.  I praised Godfor it; and calling to mind how on another occasion, when I readthis, I was very deficient,--for I saw most distinctly at thattime how deficient I was then from what I saw I was now,--Irecognised herein the great mercy of our Lord to me, and so beganto consider the place which my sins had earned for me in hell,and praised God exceedingly, because it seemed as if I did notknow my own soul again, so great a change had come over it.12. While thinking of these things, my soul was carried away withextreme violence, and I knew not why.  It seemed as if it wouldhave gone forth out of the body, for it could not contain itself,nor was it able to hope for so great a good.  The impetuosity wasso excessive that I had no power left, and, as I think, differentfrom what I had been used to.  I knew not what ailed my soul, norwhat it desired, for it was so changed.  I leaned for support,for I could not sit, because my natural strength hadutterly failed.13. Then I saw over my head a dove, very different from those weusually see, for it had not the same plumage, but wings formed ofsmall shells shining brightly.  It was larger than an ordinarydove; I thought I heard the rustling of its wings.  It hoveredabove me during the space of an Ave Maria.  But such was thestate of my soul, that in losing itself it lost also the sight ofthe dove.  My spirit grew calm with such a guest; and yet, as Ithink, a grace so wonderful might have disturbed and frightenedit; and as it began to rejoice in the vision, it was deliveredfrom all fear, and with the joy came peace, my soul continuingentranced.  The joy of this rapture was exceedingly great; andfor the rest of that festal time I was so amazed and bewilderedthat I did not know what I was doing, nor how I could havereceived so great a grace.  I neither heard nor saw anything, soto speak, because of my great inward joy.  From that day forth Iperceived in myself a very great progress in the highest love ofGod, together with a great increase in the strength of myvirtues.  May He be blessed and praised for ever!  Amen.14. On another occasion I saw that very dove above the head ofone of the Dominican fathers; but it seemed to me that the raysand brightness of the wings were far greater.  I understood bythis that he was to draw souls unto God.15. At another time I saw our Lady putting a cope of exceedingwhiteness on that Licentiate of the same Order, of whom I havemade mention more than once. [6]  She told me that she gave himthat cope in consideration of the service he had rendered her byhelping to found this house, [7] that it was a sign that shewould preserve his soul pure for the future, and that he shouldnot fall into mortal sin.  I hold it for certain that so it cameto pass, for he died within a few years; his death and the restof his life were so penitential, his whole life and death soholy, that, so far as anything can be known, there cannot be adoubt on the subject.  One of the friars present at his deathtold me that, before he breathed his last, he said to him thatSt. Thomas was with him. [8]  He died in great joy, longing todepart out of this land of exile.16. Since then he has appeared to me more than once inexceedingly great glory, and told me certain things.  He was sogiven to prayer, that when he was dying, and would haveinterrupted it if he could because of his great weakness, he wasnot able to do so; for he was often in a trance.  He wrote to menot long before he died, and asked me what he was to do; for assoon as he had said Mass he fell into a trance which lasted along time, and which he could not hinder.  At last God gave himthe reward of the many services of his whole life.17. I had certain visions, too, of the great graces which ourLord bestowed upon that rector of the Society of Jesus, of whom Ihave spoken already more than once; [9] but I will not sayanything of them now, lest I should be too tedious.  It was hislot once to be in great trouble, to suffer great persecution anddistress.  One day, when I was hearing Mass, I saw Christ on theCross at the elevation of the Host.  He spoke certain words tome, which I was to repeat to that father for his comfort,together with others, which were to warn him beforehand of whatwas coming, and to remind him of what He had suffered on hisbehalf, and that he must prepare for suffering.  This gave himgreat consolation and courage; and everything came to passafterwards as our Lord had told me.18. I have seen great things of members of the Order to whichthis father belongs, which is the Society of Jesus, and of thewhole Order itself; I have occasionally seen them in heaven withwhite banners in their hands, and I have had other most wonderfulvisions, as I am saying, about them, and therefore have a greatveneration for this Order; for I have had a great deal to do withthose who are of it, and I see that their lives are conformed tothat which our Lord gave me to understand about them.19. One night, when I was in prayer, our Lord spoke to me certainwords, whereby He made me remember the great wickedness of mypast life.  They filled me with shame and distress; for thoughthey were not spoken with severity, they caused a feeling and apainfulness which were too much for me: and we feel that we makegreater progress in the knowledge of ourselves when we hear oneof these words, than we can make by a meditation of many days onour own misery, because these words impress the truth upon us atthe same time in such a way that we cannot resist it.  He setbefore me the former inclinations of my will to vanities, andtold me to make much of the desire I now had that my will, whichhad been so ill employed, should be fixed on Him, and that Hewould accept it.20. On other occasions He told me to remember how I used to thinkit an honourable thing to go against His honour; and, again, toremember my debt to Him, for when I was most rebellious He wasbestowing His graces upon me.  If I am doing anything wrong--andmy wrong-doings are many--His Majesty makes me see it in such away that I am utterly confounded; and as I do so often, thathappens often also.  I have been found fault with by myconfessors occasionally; and on betaking myself to prayer forconsolation, have received a real reprimand.21. To return to what I was speaking of.  When our Lord made meremember my wicked life, I wept; for as I considered that I hadthen never done any good, I thought He might be about to bestowupon me some special grace; because most frequently, when Ireceive any particular mercy from our Lord, it is when I havebeen previously greatly humiliated, in order that I may the moreclearly see how far I am from deserving it.  I think our Lordmust do it for that end.22. Almost immediately after this I was so raised up in spiritthat I thought myself to be, as it were, out of the body; atleast, I did not know that I was living in it. [10]  I had avision of the most Sacred Humanity in exceeding glory, greaterthan I had ever seen It in before.  I beheld It in a wonderfuland clear way in the bosom of the Father.  I cannot tell how itwas, for I saw myself, without seeing, as it seemed to me, in thepresence of God.  My amazement was such that I remained, as Ibelieve, some days before I could recover myself.  I hadcontinually before me, as present, the Majesty of the Son of God,though not so distinctly as in the vision.  I understood thiswell enough; but the vision remained so impressed on myimagination, that I could not get rid of it for some time, thoughit had lasted but a moment; it is a great comfort to me, and alsoa great blessing.23. I have had this vision on three other occasions, and it is, Ithink, the highest vision of all the visions which our Lord inHis mercy showed me.  The fruits of it are the very greatest, forit seems to purify the soul in a wonderful way, and destroy, asit were utterly, altogether the strength of our sensual nature.It is a grand flame of fire, which seems to burn up andannihilate all the desires of this life.  For though now--glorybe to God!--I had no desire after vanities, I saw clearly in thevision how all things are vanity, and how hollow are all thedignities of earth; it was a great lesson, teaching me to raiseup my desires to the Truth alone.  It impresses on the soul asense of the presence of God such as I cannot in any waydescribe, only it is very different from that which it is in ourown power to acquire on earth.  It fills the soul with profoundastonishment at its own daring, and at any one else being able todare to offend His most awful Majesty.24. I must have spoken now and then of the effects ofvisions, [11] and of other matters of the same kind, and I havealready said that the blessings they bring with them are ofvarious degrees; but those of this vision are the highest of all.When I went to Communion once I called to mind the exceedinggreat majesty of Him I had seen, and considered that it was Hewho is present in the most Holy Sacrament, and very often ourLord was pleased to show Himself to me in the Host; the veryhairs on my head stood, [12] and I thought I should cometo nothing.25. O my Lord! ah, if Thou didst not throw a veil over Thygreatness, who would dare, being so foul and miserable, to comein contact with Thy great Majesty?  Blessed be Thou, O Lord; maythe angels and all creation praise Thee, who orderest all thingsaccording to the measure of our weakness, so that, when we havethe fruition of Thy sovereign mercies, Thy great power may notterrify us, so that we dare not, being a frail and miserablerace, persevere in that fruition!26. It might happen to us as it did to the labourer--I know it tobe a certain fact--who found a treasure beyond his expectations,which were mean.  When he saw himself in possession of it, he wasseized with melancholy, which by degrees brought him to his gravethrough simple distress and anxiety of mind, because he did notknow what to do with his treasure.  If he had not found it all atonce, and if others had given him portions of it by degrees,maintaining him thereby, he might have been more happy than hehad been in his poverty, nor would it have cost him his life.27. O Thou Treasure of the poor! how marvellously Thou sustainestsouls, showing to them, not all at once, but by little andlittle, the abundance of Thy riches!  When I behold Thy greatMajesty hidden beneath that which is so slight as the Host is, Iam filled with wonder, ever since that vision, at Thy greatwisdom; and I know not how it is that our Lord gives me thestrength and courage necessary to draw near to him, were it notthat He who has had such compassion on me, and still has, givesme strength, nor would it be possible for me to be silent, orrefrain from making known marvels so great.28. What must be the thoughts of a wretched person such as I am,full of abominations, and who has spent her life with so littlefear of God, when she draws near to our Lord's great Majesty, atthe moment He is pleased to show Himself to my soul?  How can Iopen my mouth, that has uttered so many words against Him, toreceive that most glorious Body, purity and compassion itself?The love that is visible in His most beautiful Face, sweet andtender, pains and distresses the soul, because it has not servedHim, more than all the terrors of His Majesty.  What should havebeen my thoughts, then, on those two occasions when I saw what Ihave described?  Truly, O my Lord and my joy, I am going to saythat in some way, in these great afflictions of my soul, I havedone something in Thy service.  Ah!  I know not what I am saying,for I am writing this as if the words were not mine, [13] becauseI am troubled, and in some measure beside myself, when I callthese things to remembrance.  If these thoughts were really mine,I might well say that I had done something for Thee, O my Lord;but as I can have no good thought if Thou givest it not, nothanks are due to me; I am the debtor, O Lord, and it is Thou whoart the offended One.29. Once, when I was going to Communion, I saw with the eyes ofthe soul, more distinctly than with those of the body, two devilsof most hideous shape; their horns seemed to encompass the throatof the poor priest; and I beheld my Lord, in that great majestyof which I have spoken, [14] held in the hands of that priest, inthe Host he was about to give me.  It was plain that those handswere those of a sinner, and I felt that the soul of that priestwas in mortal sin.  What must it be, O my Lord, to look upon Thybeauty amid shapes so hideous!  The two devils were so frightenedand cowed in Thy presence, that they seemed as if they would havewillingly run away, hadst Thou but given them leave.  So troubledwas I by the vision, that I knew not how I could go to Communion.I was also in great fear, for I thought, if the vision was fromGod, that His Majesty would not have allowed me to see the evilstate of that soul. [15]30. Our Lord Himself told me to pray for that priest; that He hadallowed this in order that I might understand the power of thewords of consecration, and how God failed not to be present,however wicked the priest might be who uttered them; and that Imight see His great goodness in that He left Himself in the veryhands of His enemy, for my good and for the good of all.I understood clearly how the priests are under greaterobligations to be holy than other persons; and what a horriblething it is to receive this most Holy Sacrament unworthily, andhow great is the devil's dominion over a soul in mortal sin.It did me a great service, and made me fully understand what Iowe to God.  May He be blessed for evermore!31. At another time I had a vision of a different kind, whichfrightened me very much.  I was in a place where a certain persondied, who as I understood had led a very bad life, and that formany years.  But he had been ill for two years, and in somerespects seemed to have reformed.  He died without confession;nevertheless, I did not think he would be damned.  When the bodyhad been wrapped in the winding-sheet, I saw it laid hold of by amultitude of devils, who seemed to toss it to and fro, and alsoto treat it with great cruelty.  I was terrified at the sight,for they dragged it about with great hooks.  But when I saw itcarried to the grave with all the respect and ceremoniousnesscommon to all, I began to think of the goodness of God, who wouldnot allow that person to be dishonoured, but would have the factof his being His enemy concealed.32. I was almost out of my senses at the sight.  During the wholeof the funeral service, I did not see one of the evil spirits.Afterwards, when the body was about to be laid in the grave, sogreat a multitude of them was therein waiting to receive it, thatI was beside myself at the sight, and it required no slightcourage on my part not to betray my distress. I thought of thetreatment which that soul would receive, when the devils had suchpower over the wretched body.  Would to God that all who live inmortal sin might see what I then saw,--it was a fearful sight; itwould go, I believe, a great way towards making them leadbetter lives.33. All this made me know more of what I owe to God, and of theevils from which He has delivered me.  I was in great terror.I spoke of it to my confessor, and I thought it might be anillusion of Satan, in order to take away my good opinion of thatperson, who yet was not accounted a very good Christian.The truth is, that, whether it was an illusion or not, it makesme afraid whenever I think of it.34. Now that I have begun to speak of the visions I hadconcerning the dead, I will mention some matters which our Lordwas pleased to reveal to me in relation to certain souls.  I willconfine myself to a few for the sake of brevity, and because theyare not necessary; I mean that they are not for our profit.They told me that one who had been our Provincial--he was then ofanother province--was dead.  He was a man of great virtue, withwhom I had had a great deal to do, and to whom I was under manyobligations for certain kindnesses shown me.  When I heard thathe was dead, I was exceedingly troubled, because I trembled forhis salvation, seeing that he had been superior for twenty years.That is what I dread very much; for the cure of souls seems to meto be full of danger.  I went to an oratory in great distress,and gave up to him all the good I had ever done in my wholelife,--it was little enough,--and prayed our Lord that His meritsmight fill up what was wanting, in order that this soul might bedelivered up from purgatory.35. While I was thus praying to our Lord as well as I could, heseemed to me to rise up from the depths of the earth on my righthand, and I saw him ascend to heaven in exceeding great joy.He was a very old man then, but I saw him as if he were onlythirty years old, and I thought even younger, and there was abrightness in his face.  This vision passed away very quickly;but I was so exceedingly comforted by it, that I could neveragain mourn his death, although many persons were distressed atit, for he was very much beloved.  So greatly comforted was mysoul, that nothing disturbed it, neither could I doubt the truthof the vision; I mean that it was no illusion.36. I had this vision about a fortnight after he was dead;nevertheless, I did not omit to obtain prayers for him and Iprayed myself, only I could not pray with the same earnestnessthat I should have done if I had not seen that vision.  For whenour Lord showed him thus to me, it seemed to me afterwards, whenI prayed for him to His Majesty,--and I could not help it,--thatI was like one who gave alms to a rich man.  Later on I heard anaccount of the death he died in our Lord--he was far away fromhere; it was one of such great edification, that he left allwondering to see how recollected, how penitent, and how humble hewas when he died.37. A nun, who was a great servant of God, died in this house.On the next day one of the sisters was reciting the lesson in theOffice of the Dead, which was said in choir for that nun's soul,and I was standing myself to assist her in singing the versicle,when, in the middle of the lesson, I saw the departed nun as Ibelieve, in a vision; her soul seemed to rise on my right handlike the soul of the Provincial, and ascend to heaven.This vision was not imaginary, like the preceding, but like thoseothers of which I have spoken before; [16] it is not lesscertain, however, than the other visions I had.38. Another nun died in this same house of mine, she was abouteighteen or twenty years of age, and had always been sickly.She was a great servant of God, attentive in choir, and a personof great virtue.  I certainly thought that she would not go topurgatory, on account of her exceeding merits, because theinfirmities under which she had laboured were many.  While I wassaying the Office, before she was buried,--she had been deadabout four hours,--I saw her rise in the same place and ascendto heaven.39. I was once in one of the colleges of the Society of Jesus,and in one of those great sufferings which, as I have said, [17]I occasionally had, and still have, both in soul and body, andthen so grievously that I was not able, as it seemed to me, tohave even one good thought.  The night before, one of thebrothers of that house had died in it; and I, as well as I could,was commending his soul to God, and hearing the Mass whichanother father of that Society was saying for him when I becamerecollected at once, and saw him go up to heaven in great glory,and our Lord with him.  I understood that His Majesty went withhim by way of special grace.40. Another brother of our Order, a good friar, was very ill; andwhen I was at Mass, I became recollected and saw him dead,entering into heaven without going through purgatory.  He died,as I afterwards learned, at the very time of my vision.  I wasamazed that he had not gone to purgatory.  I understood that,having become a friar and carefully kept the rule, the Bulls ofthe Order had been of use to him, so that he did not pass intopurgatory.  I do not know why I came to have this revealed to me;I think it must be because I was to learn that it is not enoughfor a man to be a friar in his habit--I mean, to wear thehabit--to attain to that state of high perfection which that of afriar is.41. I will speak no more of these things, because as I have justsaid, [18] there is no necessity for it, though our Lord has beenso gracious to me as to show me much.  But in all the visions Ihad, I saw no souls escape purgatory except this Carmelitefather, the holy friar Peter of Alcantara, and that Dominicanfather of whom I spoke before. [19]  It pleased our Lord to letme see the degree of glory to which some souls have been raised,showing them to me in the places they occupy.  There is a greatdifference between one place and another.1. Ch. xxxiv.  Doña Luisa de la Cerda, at Toledo.2. Ch. iv. § 6.3. 1 St. Peter ii. 11: 'Advenas et peregrinos.'4.

ISFJ	 XXXIX.Other Graces Bestowed on the Saint.  The Promises of Our Lordto Her.  Divine Locutions and Visions.1. I was once importuning our Lord exceedingly to restore thesight of a person who had claims upon me, and who was almostwholly blind.  I was very sorry for him, and afraid our Lordwould not hear me because of my sins.  He appeared to me as atother times, and began to show the wound in His left hand; withthe other He drew out the great nail that was in it, and itseemed to me that, in drawing the nail, He tore the flesh.The greatness of the pain was manifest, and I was very muchdistressed thereat.  He said to me, that He who had borne thatfor my sake would still more readily grant what I asked Him, andthat I was not to have any doubts about it.  He promised me therewas nothing I should ask that He would not grant; that He knew Ishould ask nothing that was not for His glory, and that He wouldgrant me what I was now praying for.  Even during the time when Idid not serve Him, I should find, if I considered it, I had askednothing that He had not granted in an ampler manner than I hadknown how to ask; how much more amply still would He grant what Iasked for, now that He knew I loved Him!  I was not to doubt.I do not think that eight days passed before our Lord restoredthat person to sight.  My confessor knew it forthwith.  It mightbe that it was not owing to my prayer; but, as I had had thevision, I have a certain conviction that it was a grace accordedto me.  I gave thanks to His Majesty.2. Again, a person was exceedingly ill of a most painful disease;but, as I do not know what it was, I do not describe it by itsname here.  What he had gone through for two months was beyondall endurance; and his pain was so great that he tore his ownflesh.  My confessor, the rector of whom I have spoken, [1] wentto see him; he was very sorry for him, and told me that I mustanyhow go myself and visit him; he was one whom I might visit,for he was my kinsman.  I went, and was moved to such a tendercompassion for him that I began, with the utmost importunity, toask our Lord to restore him to health.  Herein I saw clearly howgracious our Lord was to me, so far as I could judge; forimmediately, the next day, he was completely rid of that pain.3. I was once in the deepest distress, because I knew that aperson to whom I was under great obligations was about to commitan act highly offensive to God and dishonourable to himself.He was determined upon it.  I was so much harassed by this that Idid not know what to do in order to change his purpose; and itseemed to me as if nothing could be done.  I implored God, fromthe bottom of my heart, to find a way to hinder it; but till Ifound it I could find no relief for the pain I felt.  In mydistress, I went to a very lonely hermitage,--one of thosebelonging to this monastery,--in which there is a picture ofChrist bound to the pillar; and there, as I was imploring ourLord to grant me this grace, I heard a voice of exceedinggentleness, speaking, as it were, in a whisper. [2]  My wholebody trembled, for it made me afraid.  I wished to understandwhat was said, but I could not, for it all passed away ina moment.4. When my fears had subsided, and that was immediately, I becameconscious of an inward calmness, a joy and delight, which made memarvel how the mere hearing a voice,--I heard it with my bodilyears,--without understanding a word, could have such an effect onthe soul.  I saw by this that my prayer was granted; and so itwas; and I was freed from my anxieties about a matter not yetaccomplished, as it afterwards was, as completely as if I saw itdone.  I told my confessors of it, for I had two at this time,both of them learned men, and great servants of God.5. I knew of a person who had resolved to serve God in allearnestness, and had for some days given himself to prayer, inwhich he bad received many graces from our Lord, but who hadabandoned his good resolutions because of certain occasions ofsin in which he was involved, and which he would not avoid; theywere extremely perilous.  This caused me the utmost distress,because the person was one for whom I had a great affection, andone to whom I owed much.  For more than a month I believe I didnothing else but pray to God for his conversion.  One day, when Iwas in prayer, I saw a devil close by in a great rage, tearing topieces some paper which he had in his hands.  That sight consoledme greatly, because it seemed that my prayer had been heard.So it was, as I learnt afterwards; for that person had made hisconfession with great contrition, and returned to God sosincerely, that I trust in His Majesty he will always advancefurther and further.  May He be blessed for ever!  Amen.6. In answer to my prayers, our Lord has very often rescued soulsfrom mortal sins and led others on to greater perfection. But asto the delivering of souls out of purgatory, and other remarkableacts, so many are the mercies of our Lord herein, that were I tospeak of them I should only weary myself and my reader. But Hehas done more by me for the salvation of souls than for thehealth of the body.  This is very well known, and there are manyto bear witness to it.7. At first it made me scrupulous, because I could not helpthinking that our Lord did these things in answer to my prayer; Isay nothing of the chief reason of all--His pure compassion.  Butnow these graces are so many, and so well known to others, thatit gives me no pain to think so.  I bless His Majesty, and abasemyself, because I am still more deeply in His debt; and I believethat He makes my desire to serve Him grow, and my love revive.8. But what amazes me most is this: however much I may wish topray for those graces which our Lord sees not to be expedient, Icannot do it; and if I try, I do so with little earnestness,force, and spirit: it is impossible to do more, even if I would.But it is not so as to those which His Majesty intends to grant.These I can pray for constantly, and with great importunity;though I do not carry them in my memory, they seem to presentthemselves to me at once. [3]9. There is a great difference between these two ways of praying,and I know not how to explain it.  As to the first, when I prayfor those graces which our Lord does not mean to grant,--eventhough they concern me very nearly,--I am like one whose tongueis tied; who, though he would speak, yet cannot; or, if hespeaks, sees that people do not listen to him.  And yet I do notfail to force myself to pray, though not conscious of thatfervour which I have when praying for those graces which our Lordintends to give.  In the second case, I am like one who speaksclearly and intelligibly to another, whom he sees to be awilling listener.10. The prayer that is not to be heard is, so to speak, likevocal prayer; the other is a prayer of contemplation so high thatour Lord shows Himself in such a way as to make us feel He hearsus, and that He delights in our prayer, and that He is about togrant our petition.  Blessed be He for ever who gives me so muchand to whom I give so little!  For what is he worth, O my Lord,who does not utterly abase himself to nothing for Thee?  Howmuch, how much, how much,--I might say so a thousand times,--Ifall short of this!  It is on this account that I do not wish tolive,--though there be other reasons also,--because I do not liveaccording to the obligations which bind me to Thee.What imperfections I trace in myself! what remissness in Thyservice! Certainly, I could wish occasionally I had no sense,that I might be unconscious of the great evil that is in me.May He who can do all things help me!11. When I was staying in the house of that lady of whom I havespoken before, [4] it was necessary for me to be very watchfulover myself, and keep continually in mind the intrinsic vanity ofall the things of this life, because of the great esteem I washeld in, and of the praises bestowed on me.  There was much thereto which I might have become attached, if I had looked only tomyself; but I looked to Him who sees things as they really are,not to let me go out of His hand.  Now that I speak of seeingthings as they really are, I remember how great a trial it is forthose to whom God has granted a true insight into the things ofearth to have to discuss them with others.  They wear so manydisguises, as our Lord once told me,--and much of what I amsaying of them is not from myself, but rather what my HeavenlyMaster has taught me; and therefore, in speaking of them, when Isay distinctly I understood this, or our Lord told me this, I amvery scrupulous neither to add nor to take away one singlesyllable; so, when I do not clearly remember everything exactly,that must be taken as coming from myself, and some things,perhaps, are so altogether.  I do not call mine that which isgood, for I know there is no other good in me but only that whichour Lord gave me when I was so far from deserving it: I call thatmine which I speak without having had it made known to meby revelation.12. But, O my God, how is it that we too often judge evenspiritual things, as we do those of the world, by our ownunderstanding, wresting them grievously from their true meaning?We think we may measure our progress by the years which we havegiven to the exercise of prayer; we even think we can prescribelimits to Him who bestows His gifts not by measure [5] when Hewills, and who in six months can give to one more than to anotherin many years.  This is a fact which I have so frequentlyobserved in many persons, that I am surprised how any of us candeny it.13. I am certainly convinced that he will not remain under thisdelusion who possesses the gift of discerning spirits, and towhom our Lord has given real humility; for such a one will judgeof them by the fruits, by the good resolutions and love,--and ourLord gives him light to understand the matter; and herein Heregards the progress and advancement of souls, not the years theymay have spent in prayer; for one person may make greaterprogress in six months than another in twenty years, because, asI said before, our Lord gives to whom He will, particularly tohim who is best disposed.14. I see this in certain persons of tender years who have cometo this monastery,--God touches their hearts, and gives them alittle light and love.  I speak of that brief interval in whichHe gives them sweetness in prayer, and then they wait for nothingfurther, and make light of every difficulty, forgetting thenecessity even of food; for they shut themselves up for ever in ahouse that is unendowed, as persons who make no account of theirlife, for His sake, who, they know, loves them.  They give upeverything, even their own will; and it never enters into theirmind that they might be discontented in so small a house, andwhere enclosure is so strictly observed.  They offer themselveswholly in sacrifice to God.15. Oh, how willingly do I admit that they are better than I am!and how I ought to be ashamed of myself before God!  What HisMajesty has not been able to accomplish in me in so manyyears,--it is long ago since I began to pray, and He to bestowHis graces upon me,--He accomplished in them in three months, andin some of them even in three days, though he gives them muchfewer graces than He gave to me: and yet His Majesty rewards themwell; most assuredly they are not sorry for what they have donefor Him.16. I wish, therefore, we reminded ourselves of those long yearswhich have gone by since we made our religious profession.  I saythis to those persons, also, who have given themselves long agoto prayer, but not for the purpose of distressing those who in ashort time have made greater progress than we have made, bymaking them retrace their steps, so that they may proceed only aswe do ourselves.  We must not desire those who, because of thegraces God has given them, are flying like eagles, to become likechickens whose feet are tied.  Let us rather look to His Majesty,and give these souls the reins, if we see that they are humble;for our Lord, who has had such compassion upon them, will not letthem fall into the abyss.17. These souls trust themselves in the hands of God, for thetruth, which they learn by faith, helps them to do it; and shallnot we also trust them to Him, without seeking to measure them byour measure which is that of our meanness of spirit?  We must notdo it; for if we cannot ascend to the heights of their great loveand courage,--without experience none can comprehend them--let ushumble ourselves, and not condemn them; for, by this seemingregard to their progress, we hinder our own, and miss theopportunity our Lord gives us to humble ourselves, to ascertainour own shortcomings, and learn how much more detached and morenear to God these souls must be than we are, seeing that HisMajesty draws so near to them Himself.18. I have no other intention here, and I wish to have no other,than to express my preference for the prayer that in a short timeresults in these great effects, which show themselves at once;for it is impossible they should enable us to leave all thingsonly to please God, if they were not accompanied with a vehementlove.  I would rather have that prayer than that which lastedmany years, but which at the end of the time, as well as at thebeginning, never issued in a resolution to do anything for God,with the exception of some trifling services, like a grain ofsalt, without weight or bulk, and which a bird might carry awayin its mouth.  Is it not a serious and mortifying thought that weare making much of certain services which we render our Lord, butwhich are too pitiable to be considered, even if they were manyin number?  This is my case, and I am forgetting every moment themercies of our Lord.  I do not mean that His Majesty will notmake much of them Himself, for He is good; but I wish I made noaccount of them myself, or even perceived that I did them, forthey are nothing worth.19. But, O my Lord, do Thou forgive me, and blame me not, if Itry to console myself a little with the little I do, seeing thatI do not serve Thee at all; for if I rendered Thee any greatservices, I should not think of these trifles.  Blessed are theywho serve Thee in great deeds; if envying these, and desiring todo what they do, were of any help to me, I should not be so farbehind them as I am in pleasing Thee; but I am nothing worth, Omy Lord; do Thou make me of some worth, Thou who lovest meso much.20. During one of those days, when this monastery, which seems tohave cost me some labour, was fully founded by the arrival of theBrief from Rome, which empowered us to live without anendowment; [6] and I was comforting myself at seeing the wholeaffair concluded, and thinking of all the trouble I had had, andgiving thanks to our Lord for having been pleased to make someuse of me,--it happened that I began to consider all that we hadgone through.  Well, so it was; in every one of my actions, whichI thought were of some service, I traced so many faults andimperfections, now and then but little courage, very frequently awant of faith; for until this moment, when I see everythingaccomplished, I never absolutely believed; neither, however, onthe other hand, could I doubt what our Lord said to me about thefoundation of this house.  I cannot tell how it was; very oftenthe matter seemed to me, on the one hand, impossible; and, on theother hand, I could not be in doubt; I mean, I could not believethat it would not be accomplished.  In short, I find that ourLord Himself, on His part, did all the good that was done, whileI did all the evil.  I therefore ceased to think of the matter,and wished never to be reminded of it again, lest I should domyself some harm by dwelling on my many faults. Blessed be Hewho, when He pleases, draws good out of all my failings!  Amen.21. I say, then, there is danger in counting the years we havegiven to prayer; for, granting that there is nothing in itagainst humility, it seems to me to imply something like anappearance of thinking that we have merited, in some degree, bythe service rendered.  I do not mean that there is no merit in itat all, nor that it will not be well rewarded; yet if anyspiritual person thinks, because he has given himself to prayerfor many years, that he deserves any spiritual consolations, I amsure he will never attain to spiritual perfection.  Is it notenough that a man has merited the protection of God, which keepshim from committing those sins into which he fell before he beganto pray, but he must also, as they say, sue God for Hisown money?22. This does not seem to me to be deep humility, and yet it maybe that it is; however, I look on it as great boldness, for I,who have very little humility, have never ventured upon it.It may be that I never asked for it, because I had never servedHim; perhaps, if I had served Him, I should have been moreimportunate than all others with our Lord for my reward.23. I do not mean that the soul makes no progress in time, orthat God will not reward it, if its prayer has been humble; but Ido mean that we should forget the number of years we have beenpraying, because all that we can do is utterly worthless incomparison with one drop of blood out of those which our Lordshed for us.  And if the more we serve Him, the more we becomeHis debtors, what is it, then, we are asking for? for, if we payone farthing of the debt, He gives us back a thousand ducats.For the love of God, let us leave these questions alone, for theybelong to Him.  Comparisons are always bad, even in earthlythings; what, then, must they be in that, the knowledge of whichGod has reserved to Himself? His Majesty showed this clearlyenough, when those who came late and those who came early to Hisvineyard received the same wages. [7]24. I have sat down so often to write, and have been so many dayswriting these three leaves,--for, as I have said, [8] I had, andhave still, but few opportunities,--that I forgot what I hadbegun with, namely, the following vision. [9]25. I was in prayer, and saw myself on a wide plain all alone.Round about me stood a great multitude of all kinds of people,who hemmed me in on every side; all of them seemed to haveweapons of war in their hands, to hurt me; some had spears,others swords; some had daggers, and others very long rapiers.In short, I could not move away in any direction without exposingmyself to the hazard of death, and I was alone, without any oneto take my part.  In this my distress of mind, not knowing whatto do, I lifted up my eyes to heaven, and saw Christ, not inheaven, but high above me in the air, holding out His hand to me,and there protecting me in such a way that I was no longer afraidof all that multitude, neither could they, though they wished it,do me any harm.26. At first the vision seemed to have no results; but it hasbeen of the greatest help to me, since I understood what itmeant.  Not long afterwards, I saw myself, as it were, exposed tothe like assault, and I saw that the vision represented theworld, because everything in it takes up arms against the poorsoul.  We need not speak of those who are not great servants ofour Lord, nor of honours, possessions, and pleasures, with otherthings of the same nature; for it is clear that the soul, if itbe not watchful, will find itself caught in a net,--at least, allthese things labour to ensnare it; more than this, so also dofriends and relatives, and--what frightens me most--even goodpeople.  I found myself afterwards so beset on all sides, goodpeople thinking they were doing good, and I knowing not how todefend myself, nor what to do.27. O my God, if I were to say in what way, and in how many ways,I was tried at that time, even after that trial of which I havejust spoken, what a warning I should be giving to men to hate thewhole world utterly!  It was the greatest of all the persecutionsI had to undergo.  I saw myself occasionally so hemmed in onevery side, that I could do nothing else but lift up my eyes toheaven, and cry unto God. [10] I recollected well what I had seenin the vision, and it helped me greatly not to trust much in anyone, for there is no one that can be relied on except God.In all my great trials, our Lord--He showed it to me--sent alwayssome one on His part to hold out his hand to help me, as it wasshown to me in the vision, so that I might attach myself tonothing, but only please our Lord; and this has been enough tosustain the little virtue I have in desiring to serve Thee: beThou blessed for evermore!28. On one occasion I was exceedingly disquieted and troubled,unable to recollect myself, fighting and struggling with mythoughts, running upon matters which did not relate toperfection; and, moreover, I did not think I was so detached fromall things as I used to be.  When I found myself in this wretchedstate, I was afraid that the graces I had received from our Lordwere illusions, and the end was that a great darkness covered mysoul.  In this my distress our Lord began to speak to me: He bademe not to harass myself, but learn, from the consideration of mymisery, what it would be if He withdrew Himself from me, and thatwe were never safe while living in the flesh.  It was given me tounderstand how this fighting and struggling are profitable to us,because of the reward, and it seemed to me as if our Lord weresorry for us who live in the world.  Moreover, He bade me not tosuppose that He had forgotten me; He would never abandon me, butit was necessary I should do all that I could myself.29. Our Lord said all this with great tenderness and sweetness;He also spoke other most gracious words, which I need not repeat.His Majesty, further showing His great love for me, said to mevery often: 'Thou art Mine, and I am thine.'  I am in the habitof saying myself, and I believe in all sincerity: 'What do I carefor myself?--I care only for Thee, O my Lord.'30. These words of our Lord, and the consolation He gives me,fill me with the utmost shame, when I remember what I am.  I havesaid it before, I think, [11] and I still say now and then to myconfessor, that it requires greater courage to receive thesegraces than to endure the heaviest trials.  When they come, Iforget, as it were, all I have done, and there is nothing beforeme but a picture of my wretchedness, and my understanding canmake no reflections; this, also, seems to me at times tobe supernatural.31. Sometimes I have such a vehement longing for Communion; I donot think it can be expressed.  One morning it happened to rainso much as to make it seem impossible to leave the house.  When Ihad gone out, I was so beside myself with that longing, that ifspears had been pointed at my heart, I should have rushed uponthem; the rain was nothing.  When I entered the church I fellinto a deep trance, and saw heaven open--not a door only, as Iused to see at other times.  I beheld the throne which, as I havetold you, my father, I saw at other times, with another throneabove it, whereon, though I saw not, I understood by a certaininexplicable knowledge that the Godhead dwelt.32. The throne seemed to me to be supported by certain animals; Ibelieve I saw the form of them: I thought they might be theEvangelists.  But how the throne was arrayed, and Him who sat onit I did not see, but only an exceedingly great multitude ofangels, who seemed to me more beautiful, beyond all comparison,than those I had seen in heaven.  I thought they were, perhaps,the seraphim or cherubim, for they were very different in theirglory, and seemingly all on fire.  The difference is great, as Isaid before; [12] and the joy I then felt cannot be described,either in writing or by word of mouth; it is inconceivable to anyone what has not had experience of it. I felt that everything mancan desire was all there together, and I saw nothing; they toldme, but I know not who, that all I could do there was tounderstand that I could understand nothing, and see howeverything was nothing in comparison with that.  So it was; mysoul afterwards was vexed to see that it could rest on anycreated thing: how much more, then, if it had any affectionthereto; for everything seemed to me but an ant-hill.I communicated, and remained during Mass.  I know not how it was:I thought I had been but a few minutes, and was amazed when theclock struck; I had been two hours in that trance and joy.33. I was afterwards amazed at this fire, which seems to springforth out of the true love of God; for though I might long forit, labour for it, and annihilate myself in the effort to obtainit, I can do nothing towards procuring a single spark of itmyself, because it all comes of the good pleasure of His Majesty,as I said on another occasion. [13]  It seems to burn up the oldman, with his faults, his lukewarmness, and misery; so that it islike the phoenix, of which I have read that it comes forth, afterbeing burnt, out of its own ashes into a new life.  Thus it iswith the soul: it is changed into another, whose desires aredifferent, and whose strength is great.  It seems to be no longerwhat it was before, and begins to walk renewed in purity in theways of our Lord.  When I was praying to Him that thus it mightbe with me, and that I might begin His service anew, He said tome: 'The comparison thou hast made is good; take care never toforget it, that thou mayest always labour to advance.'34. Once, when I was doubting, as I said just now, [14] whetherthese visions came from God or not, our Lord appeared, and, withsome severity, said to me: 'O children of men, how long will youremain hard of heart!'  I was to examine myself carefully on onesubject,--whether I had given myself up wholly to Him, or not.If I had,--and it was so,--I was to believe that He would notsuffer me to perish.  I was very much afflicted when He spokethus, but He turned to me with great tenderness and sweetness,and bade me not to distress myself, for He knew already that, sofar as it lay in my power, I would not fail in anything that wasfor His service; that He Himself would do what I wished,--and soHe did grant what I was then praying for; that I was to considermy love for Him, which was daily growing in me, for I should seeby this that these visions did not come from Satan; that I mustnot imagine that God would ever allow the devil to have so muchpower over the souls of His servants as to give them suchclearness of understanding and such peace as I had.35. He gave me also to understand that, when such and so manypersons had told me the visions were from God, I should do wrongif I did not believe them. [15]36. Once, when I was reciting the psalm Quicumque vult, [16] Iwas given to understand the mystery of One God and Three Personswith so much clearness, that I was greatly astonished andconsoled at the same time.  This was of the greatest help to me,for it enabled me to know more of the greatness and marvels ofGod; and when I think of the most Holy Trinity, or hear It spokenof, I seem to understand the mystery, and a great joy it is.37. One day--it was the Feast of the Assumption of the Queen ofthe Angels, and our Lady--our Lord was pleased to grant me thisgrace.  In a trance He made me behold her going up to heaven, thejoy and solemnity of her reception there, as well as the placewhere she now is.  To describe it is more than I can do; the joythat filled my soul at the sight of such great glory wasexcessive.  The effects of the vision were great; it made me longto endure still greater trials: and I had a vehement desire toserve our Lady, because of her great merits.38. Once, in one of the colleges of the Society of Jesus, whenthe brothers of the house were communicating, I saw anexceedingly rich canopy above their heads.  I saw this twice; butI never saw it when others were receiving Communion.1. Ch. xxxiii. § 10.  F. Gaspar de Salazar.2. 3 Kings xix. 12: 'Sibilus auræ tenuis.'3.

ISFJ	 XL.Visions, Revelations, and Locutions.1. One day, in prayer, the sweetness of which was so great that,knowing how unworthy I was of so great a blessing, I began tothink how much I had deserved to be in that place which I hadseen prepared for me in hell,--for, as I said before, [1] I neverforget the way I saw myself there,--as I was thinking of this, mysoul began to be more and more on fire, and I was carried away inspirit in a way I cannot describe.  It seemed to me as if I hadbeen absorbed in, and filled with, that grandeur of God which, onanother occasion, I had felt. [2]  In that majesty it was givenme to understand one truth, which is the fulness of all truth,but I cannot tell how, for I saw nothing.  It was said to me, Isaw not by whom, but I knew well enough it was the Truth Itself:'This I am doing to thee is not a slight matter; it is one ofthose things for which thou owest Me much; for all the evil inthe world comes from ignorance of the truths of the holy writingsin their clear simplicity, of which not one iota shall passaway.' [3]  I thought that I had always believed this, and thatall the faithful also believed it.  Then he said,: 'Ah, Mydaughter, they are few who love Me in truth; for if men loved Me,I should not hide My secrets from them.  Knowest thou what it isto love Me in truth?  It is to admit everything to be a lie whichis not pleasing unto Me.  Now thou dost not understand it, butthou shalt understand it clearly hereafter, in the profit it willbe to thy soul.'2. Our Lord be praised, so I found it; for after this vision Ilook upon everything which does not tend to the service of God asvanity and lies.  I cannot tell how much I am convinced of this,nor how sorry I am for those whom I see living in darkness, notknowing the truth.  I derived other great blessings also fromthis, some of which I will here speak of, others I cannotdescribe.3. Our Lord at the same time uttered a special word of mostexceeding graciousness.  I know not how it was done, for I sawnothing; but I was filled, in a way which also I cannot describe,with exceeding strength and earnestness of purpose to observewith all my might everything contained in the divine writings.I thought that I could rise above every possible hindrance put inmy way.4. Of this divine truth, which was put before me I know not how,there remains imprinted within me a truth--I cannot give it aname--which fills me with a new reverence for God; it gives me anotion of His Majesty and power in a way which I cannot explain.I can understand that it is something very high.  I had a verygreat desire never to speak of anything but of those deep truthswhich far surpass all that is spoken of here in the world,--andso the living in it began to be painful to me.5. The vision left me in great tenderness, joy, and humility.It seemed to me, though I knew not how, that our Lord now gave megreat things; and I had no suspicion whatever of any illusion.I saw nothing; but I understood how great a blessing it is tomake no account of anything which does not lead us nearer untoGod.  I also understood what it is for a soul to be walking inthe truth, in the presence of the Truth itself.  What Iunderstood is this: that our Lord gave me to understand that Heis Himself the very Truth.6. All this I am speaking of I learnt at times by means of wordsuttered; at other times I learnt some things without the help ofwords, and that more clearly than those other things which weretold me in words.  I understood exceedingly deep truthsconcerning the Truth, more than I could have done through theteaching of many learned men.  It seems to me that learned mennever could have thus impressed upon me, nor so clearly explainedto me, the vanity of this world.7. The Truth of which I am speaking, and which I was given tosee, is Truth Itself, in Itself.  It has neither beginning norend.  All other truths depend on this Truth, as all other lovesdepend on this love, and all other grandeurs on this grandeur.I understood it all, notwithstanding that my words are obscure incomparison with that distinctness with which it pleased our Lordto show it to me.  What think you must be the power of HisMajesty, seeing that in so short a time it leaves so great ablessing and such an impression on the soul?  O Grandeur!Majesty of mine! what is it Thou art doing, O my Lord Almighty!Consider who it is to whom Thou givest blessings so great!  DostThou not remember that this my soul has been an abyss of lies anda sea of vanities, and all my fault?  Though Thou hadst given mea natural hatred of lying yet I did involve myself in many lyingways.  How is this, O my God? how can it be that mercies andgraces so great should fall to the lot of one who has so illdeserved them at Thy hands?8. Once, when I was with the whole community reciting the Office,my soul became suddenly recollected, and seemed to me all brightas a mirror, clear behind, sideways, upwards, and downwards; andin the centre of it I saw Christ our Lord, as I usually see Him.It seemed to me that I saw Him distinctly in every part of mysoul, as in a mirror, and at the same time the mirror was allsculptured--I cannot explain it--in our Lord Himself by a mostloving communication which I can never describe.  I know thatthis vision was a great blessing to me, and is still whenever Iremember it, particularly after Communion.9. I understood by it, that, when a soul is in mortal sin, thismirror becomes clouded with a thick vapour, and utterly obscured,so that our Lord is neither visible nor present, though He isalways present in the conservation of its being.  In heretics,the mirror is, as it were, broken in pieces, and that is worsethan being dimmed.  There is a very great difference betweenseeing this and describing it, for it can hardly be explained.But it has done me great good; it has also made me very sorry onaccount of those times when I dimmed the lustre of my soul by mysins, so that I could not see our Lord.10. This vision seems to me very profitable to recollectedpersons, to teach them to look upon our Lord as being in theinnermost part of their soul.  It is a method of looking upon Himwhich penetrates us more thoroughly, and is much more fruitful,than that of looking upon Him as external to us, as I have saidelsewhere, [4] and as it is laid down in books on prayer, wherethey speak of where we are to seek God.  The gloriousSt. Augustin, [5] in particular, says so, when he says thatneither in the streets of the city, nor in pleasures, nor in anyplace whatever where he sought Him, did he find Him as he foundHim within himself.  This is clearly the best way; we need not goup to heaven, nor any further than our own selves, for that wouldonly distress the spirit and distract the soul, and bring butlittle fruit.11. I should like to point out one result of a deep trance; itmay be that some are aware of it.  When the time is over duringwhich the soul was in union, wherein all its powers were whollyabsorbed,--it lasts, as I have said, [6] but a moment,--the soulcontinues still to be recollected, unable to recover itself evenin outward things; for the two powers--the memory and theunderstanding--are, as it were, in a frenzy, extremelydisordered.  This, I say, happens occasionally, particularly inthe beginnings.  I am thinking whether it does not result fromthis: that our natural weakness cannot endure the vehemence ofthe spirit, which is so great, and that the imagination isenfeebled.  I know it to be so with some.  I think it best forthese to force themselves to give up prayer at that time, andresume it afterwards, when they may recover what they have lost,and not do everything at once, for in that case much harm mightcome of it.  I know this by experience, as well as the necessityof considering what our health can bear.12. Experience is necessary throughout, so also is a spiritualdirector; for when the soul has reached this point, there aremany matters which must be referred to the director.  If, afterseeking such a one, the soul cannot find him, our Lord will notfail that soul, seeing that He has not failed me, who am what Iam: They are not many, I believe, who know by experience so manythings, and without experience it is useless to treat a soul atall, for nothing will come of it, save only trouble and distress.But our Lord will take this also into account, and for thatreason it is always best to refer the matter to the director.I have already more than once said this, [7] and even all I amsaying now, only I do not distinctly remember it; but I do seethat it is of great importance, particularly to women, that theyshould go to their confessor, and that he should be a man ofexperience herein.  There are many more women than men to whomour Lord gives these graces; I have heard the holy friar Peter ofAlcantara say so, and, indeed, I know it myself.  He used to saythat women made greater progress in this way than men did; and hegave excellent reasons for his opinion, all in favour of women;but there is no necessity for repeating them here.13. Once, when in prayer, I had a vision, for a moment,--I sawnothing distinctly, but the vision was most clear,--how allthings are seen in God and how all things are comprehended inHim.  I cannot in any way explain it, but the vision remains mostdeeply impressed on my soul, and is one of those grand graceswhich our Lord wrought in me, and one of those which put me tothe greatest shame and confusion whenever I call my sins toremembrance.  I believe, if it had pleased our Lord that I hadseen this at an earlier time, or if they saw it who sin againstHim, we should have neither the heart nor the daring to do so.I had the vision, I repeat it, but I cannot say that I sawanything; however, I must have seen something, seeing that Iexplain it by an illustration, only it must have been in a way sosubtile and delicate that the understanding is unable to reachit, or I am so ignorant in all that relates to these visions,which seem to be not imaginary.  In some of these visions theremust be something imaginary, only, as the powers of the soul arethen in a trance, they are not able afterwards to retain theforms, as our Lord showed them to it then, and as He would haveit rejoice in them.14. Let us suppose the Godhead to be a most brilliant diamond,much larger than the whole world, or a mirror like that to whichI compared the soul in a former vision, [8] only in a way so highthat I cannot possibly describe it; and that all our actions areseen in that diamond, which is of such dimensions as to includeeverything, because nothing can be beyond it.  It was a fearfulthing for me to see, in so short a time, so many things togetherin that brilliant diamond, and a most piteous thing too, wheneverI think of it, to see such foul things as my sins present in thepure brilliancy of that light.15. So it is, whenever I remember it, I do not know how to bearit, and I was then so ashamed of myself that I knew not where tohide myself.  Oh, that some one could make this plain to thosewho commit most foul and filthy sins, that they may remembertheir sins are not secret, and that God most justly resents them,seeing that they are wrought in the very presence of His Majesty,and that we are demeaning ourselves so irreverently before Him!I saw, too, how completely hell is deserved for only one mortalsin, and how impossible it is to understand the exceeding greatwickedness of committing it in the sight of majesty so great, andhow abhorrent to His nature such actions are.  In this we seemore and more of His mercifulness, who, though we all know Hishatred of sin, yet suffers us to live.16. The vision made me also reflect, that if one such vision asthis fills the souls with such awe, what will it be in the day ofjudgment, when His Majesty will appear distinctly, and when wetoo shall look on the sins we have committed!  O my God, I havebeen, oh, how blind!  I have often been amazed at what I havewritten; and you, my father, be you not amazed at anything, butthat I am still living,--I, who see such things, and know myselfto be what I am.  Blessed for ever be He who has borne with meso long!17. Once, in prayer, with much recollection, sweetness, andrepose, I saw myself, as it seemed to me, surrounded by angels,and was close unto God.  I began to intercede with His Majesty onbehalf of the church.  I was given to understand the greatservices which a particular Order would render in the latterdays, and the courage with which its members would maintainthe faith.18. I was praying before the most Holy Sacrament one day; I had avision of a Saint, whose Order was in some degree fallen. In hishands he held a large book, which he opened, and then told me toread certain words, written in large and very legible letters;they were to this effect: 'In times to come this Order willflourish; it will have many martyrs.' [9]19. On another occasion, when I was at Matins in choir, six orseven persons, who seemed to me to be of this Order, appeared andstood before me with swords in their hands.  The meaning of that,as I think, is that they are to be defenders of the faith; for atanother time, when I was in prayer, I fell into a trance, andstood in spirit on a wide plain, where many persons werefighting; and the members of this Order were fighting with greatzeal.  Their faces were beautiful, and as it were on fire.Many they laid low on the ground defeated, others they killed.It seemed to me to be a battle with heretics.20. I have seen this glorious Saint occasionally, and he has toldme certain things, and thanked me for praying for his Order, andhe has promised to pray for me to our Lord.  I do not say whichOrders these are,--our Lord, if it so pleased Him, could makethem known,--lest the others should be aggrieved.  Let everyOrder, or every member of them by himself, labour, that by hismeans our Lord would so bless his own Order that it may serve Himin the present grave necessities of His Church.  Blessed are theywhose lives are so spent.21. I was once asked by a person to pray God to let him knowwhether his acceptance of a bishopric would be for the service ofGod.  After Communion our Lord said to me: 'When he shall haveclearly and really understood that true dominion consists inpossessing nothing, he may then accept it.'  I understood by thisthat he who is to be in dignity must be very far from wishing ordesiring it, or at least he must not seek it.22. These and many other graces our Lord has given, and is givingcontinually, to me a sinner.  I do not think it is necessary tospeak of them, because the state of my soul can be ascertainedfrom what I have written; so also can the spirit which our Lordhas given me.  May He be blessed for ever, who has been somindful of me!23. Our Lord said to me once, consoling me, that I was not todistress myself,--this He said most lovingly,--because in thislife we could not continue in the same state. [10]  At one time Ishould be fervent, at another not; now disquieted, and again atpeace, and tempted; but I must hope in Him, and fear not.24. I was one day thinking whether it was a want of detachment inme to take pleasure in the company of those who had the care ofmy soul, and to have an affection for them, and to comfort myselfwith those whom I see to be very great servants of God. [11]Our Lord said to me: 'It is not a virtue in a sick man to abstainfrom thanking and loving the physician who seems to restore himto health when he is in danger of death.  What should I have donewithout these persons?  The conversation of good people was neverhurtful; my words should always be weighed, and holy; and I wasnot to cease my relations with them, for they would do me goodrather than harm.'25. This was a great comfort to me, because, now and then, Iwished to abstain from converse with all people; for it seemed tome that I was attached to them.  Always, in all things, did ourLord console me, even to the showing me how I was to treat thosewho were weak, and some other people also.  Never did He cease totake care of me.  I am sometimes distressed to see how little Ido in His service, and how I am forced to spend time in takingcare of a body so weak and worthless as mine is, more thanI wish.26. I was in prayer one night, when it was time to go to sleep.I was in very great pain, and my usual sickness was comingon. [12]  I saw myself so great a slave to myself, and, on theother hand, the spirit asked for time for itself.  I was so muchdistressed that I began to weep exceedingly, and to be verysorry.  This has happened to me not once only, but, as I amsaying, very often; and it seems to make me weary of myself, sothat at the time I hold myself literally in abhorrence.Habitually, however, I know that I do not hate myself, and Inever fail to take that which I see to be necessary for me.May our Lord grant that I do not take more than is necessary!--Iam afraid I do.27. When I was thus distressed, our Lord appeared unto me.He comforted me greatly, and told me I must do this for His love,and bear it; my life was necessary now.  And so, I believe, Ihave never known real pain since I resolved to serve my Lord andmy Consoler with all my strength; for though he would leave me tosuffer a little, yet He would console me in such a way that I amdoing nothing when I long for troubles.  And it seems to me thereis nothing worth living for but this, and suffering is what Imost heartily pray to God for.  I say to Him sometimes, with mywhole heart: 'O Lord, either to die or to suffer!  I ask of Theenothing else for myself.'  It is a comfort to me to hear theclock strike, because I seem to have come a little nearer to thevision of God, in that another hour of my life has passed away.28. At other times I am in such a state that I do not feel that Iam living, nor yet do I desire to die but I am lukewarm, anddarkness surrounds me on every side, as I said before; [13] for Iam very often in great trouble.  It pleased our Lord that thegraces He wrought in me should be published abroad, [14] as Hetold me some years ago they should be.  It was a great pain tome, and I have borne much on that account even to this day, asyou, my father, know, because every man explains them in his ownsense.  But my comfort herein is that it is not my fault thatthey are become known, for I was extremely cautious never tospeak of them but to my confessors, or to persons who I knew hadheard of them from them.  I was silent, however, not out ofhumility, but because, as I said before, [15] it gave me greatpain to speak of them even to my confessors.29. Now, however,--to God be the glory!--though many speakagainst me, but out of a zeal for goodness, and though some areafraid to speak to me, and even to hear my confession, and thoughothers have much to say about me, because I see that our Lordwilled by this means to provide help for many souls,--and alsobecause I see clearly and keep in mind how much He would suffer,if only for the gaining of one,--I do not care about it at all.30. I know not why it is so, but perhaps the reason may in somemeasure be that His Majesty has placed me in this corner out ofthe way, where the enclosure is so strict, and where I am as onethat is dead.  I thought that no one would remember me, but I amnot so much forgotten as I wish I was, for I am forced to speakto some people.  But as I am in a house where none may see me, itseems as if our Lord had been pleased to bring me to a haven,which I trust in His Majesty will be secure.  Now that I am outof the world, with companions holy and few in number, I look downon the world as from a great height, and care very little whatpeople say or know about me.  I think much more of one soul'sadvancement, even if it were but slight, than of all that peoplemay say of me; and since I am settled here it has pleased ourLord that all my desires tend to this.31. He has made my life to me now a kind of sleep; for almostalways what I see seems to me to be seen as in a dream, nor haveI any great sense either of pleasure or of pain.  If mattersoccur which may occasion either, the sense of it passes away soquickly that it astonishes me, and leaves an impression as if Ihad been dreaming,--and this is the simple truth; for if I wishedafterwards to delight in that pleasure, or be sorry over thatpain, it is not in my power to do so: just as a sensible personfeels neither pain nor pleasure in the memory of a dream that ispast; for now our Lord has roused my soul out of that statewhich, because I was not mortified nor dead to the things of thisworld, made me feel as I did, and His Majesty does not wish me tobecome blind again.32. This is the way I live now, my lord and father; do you, myfather, pray to God that He would take me to Himself, or enableme to serve Him.  May it please His Majesty that what I havewritten may be of some use to you, my father!  I have so littletime, [16] and therefore my trouble has been great in writing;but it will be a blessed trouble if I have succeeded in sayinganything that will cause one single act of praise to our Lord.If that were the case, I should look upon myself as sufficientlyrewarded, even if you, my father, burnt at once what I havewritten.  I would rather it were not burnt before those three sawit, whom you, my father, know of, because they are, and havebeen, my confessors; for if it be bad, it is right they shouldlose the good opinion they have of me; and if it be good, theyare good and learned men, and I know they will recognise itssource, and give praise to Him who hath spoken through me.33. May His Majesty ever be your protector, and make you so greata saint that your spirit and light may show the way to me amiserable creature, so wanting in humility and so bold as to haveventured to write on subjects so high!  May our Lord grant I havenot fallen into any errors in the matter, for I had the intentionand the desire to be accurate and obedient, and also that throughme He might, in some measure, have glory,--because that is what Ihave been praying for these many years; and as my good works areinefficient for that end, I have ventured to put in order this mydisordered life.  Still, I have not wasted more time, nor givenit more attention, than was necessary for writing it; yet I haveput down all that has happened to me with all the simplicity andsincerity possible.34. May our Lord, who is all-powerful, grant--and He can if Hewill--that I may attain to the doing of His will in all things!May He never suffer this soul to be lost, which He so often, inso many ways, and by so many means, has rescued from hell anddrawn unto Himself!  Amen.

ISFP	 I.ANCESTRY--BIRTH--BOYHOOD.My family is American, and has been for generations, in all itsbranches, direct and collateral.Mathew Grant, the founder of the branch in America, of which I am adescendant, reached Dorchester, Massachusetts, in May, 1630.  In 1635 hemoved to what is now Windsor, Connecticut, and was the surveyor for thatcolony for more than forty years.  He was also, for many years of thetime, town clerk.  He was a married man when he arrived at Dorchester,but his children were all born in this country.  His eldest son, Samuel,took lands on the east side of the Connecticut River, opposite Windsor,which have been held and occupied by descendants of his to this day.I am of the eighth generation from Mathew Grant, and seventh fromSamuel.  Mathew Grant's first wife died a few years after theirsettlement in Windsor, and he soon after married the widow Rockwell,who, with her first husband, had been fellow-passengers with him and hisfirst wife, on the ship Mary and John, from Dorchester, England, in1630.  Mrs. Rockwell had several children by her first marriage, andothers by her second.  By intermarriage, two or three generations later,I am descended from both the wives of Mathew Grant.In the fifth descending generation my great grandfather, Noah Grant, andhis younger brother, Solomon, held commissions in the English army, in1756, in the war against the French and Indians.  Both were killed thatyear.My grandfather, also named Noah, was then but nine years old. At thebreaking out of the war of the Revolution, after the battles of Concordand Lexington, he went with a Connecticut company to join theContinental army, and was present at the battle of Bunker Hill.  Heserved until the fall of Yorktown, or through the entire Revolutionarywar.  He must, however, have been on furlough part of the time--as Ibelieve most of the soldiers of that period were--for he married inConnecticut during the war, had two children, and was a widower at theclose.  Soon after this he emigrated to Westmoreland County,Pennsylvania, and settled near the town of Greensburg in that county.He took with him the younger of his two children, Peter Grant.  Theelder, Solomon, remained with his relatives in Connecticut until oldenough to do for himself, when he emigrated to the British West Indies.Not long after his settlement in Pennsylvania, my grandfather, CaptainNoah Grant, married a Miss Kelly, and in 1799 he emigrated again, thistime to Ohio, and settled where the town of Deerfield now stands.  Hehad now five children, including Peter, a son by his first marriage.  Myfather, Jesse R. Grant, was the second child--oldest son, by the secondmarriage.Peter Grant went early to Maysville, Kentucky, where he was veryprosperous, married, had a family of nine children, and was drowned atthe mouth of the Kanawha River, Virginia, in 1825, being at the time oneof the wealthy men of the West.My grandmother Grant died in 1805, leaving seven children.  This brokeup the family.  Captain Noah Grant was not thrifty in the way of 'layingup stores on earth,' and, after the death of his second wife, he went,with the two youngest children, to live with his son Peter, inMaysville.  The rest of the family found homes in the neighborhood ofDeerfield, my father in the family of judge Tod, the father of the lateGovernor Tod, of Ohio.  His industry and independence of character weresuch, that I imagine his labor compensated fully for the expense of hismaintenance.There must have been a cordiality in his welcome into the Tod family,for to the day of his death he looked upon judge Tod and his wife, withall the reverence he could have felt if they had been parents instead ofbenefactors.  I have often heard him speak of Mrs. Tod as the mostadmirable woman he had ever known.  He remained with the Tod family onlya few years, until old enough to learn a trade.  He went first, Ibelieve, with his half-brother, Peter Grant, who, though not a tannerhimself, owned a tannery in Maysville, Kentucky.  Here he learned histrade, and in a few years returned to Deerfield and worked for, andlived in the family of a Mr. Brown, the father of John Brown--'whosebody lies mouldering in the grave, while his soul goes marching on.'  Ihave often heard my father speak of John Brown, particularly since theevents at Harper's Ferry.  Brown was a boy when they lived in the samehouse, but he knew him afterwards, and regarded him as a man of greatpurity of character, of high moral and physical courage, but a fanaticand extremist in whatever he advocated.  It was certainly the act of aninsane man to attempt the invasion of the South, and the overthrow ofslavery, with less than twenty men.My father set up for himself in business, establishing a tannery atRavenna, the county seat of Portage County.  In a few years he removedfrom Ravenna, and set up the same business at Point Pleasant, ClermontCounty, Ohio.During the minority of my father, the West afforded but poor facilitiesfor the most opulent of the youth to acquire an education, and themajority were dependent, almost exclusively, upon their own exertionsfor whatever learning they obtained. 
ISFP	 I have often heard him say thathis time at school was limited to six months, when he was very young,too young, indeed, to learn much, or to appreciate the advantages of aneducation, and to a 'quarter's schooling' afterwards, probably whileliving with judge Tod.  But his thirst for education was intense.  Helearned rapidly, and was a constant reader up to the day of his death inhis eightieth year.  Books were scarce in the Western Reserve during hisyouth, but he read every book he could borrow in the neighborhood wherehe lived.  This scarcity gave him the early habit of studying everythinghe read, so that when he got through with a book, he knew everything init.  The habit continued through life.  Even after reading the dailypapers--which he never neglected--he could give all the importantinformation they contained.  He made himself an excellent Englishscholar, and before he was twenty years of age was a constantcontributor to Western newspapers, and was also, from that time until hewas fifty years old, an able debater in the societies for this purpose,which were common in the West at that time.  He always took an activepart in politics, but was never a candidate for office, except, Ibelieve, that he was the first Mayor of Georgetown.  He supportedJackson for the Presidency; but he was a Whig, a great admirer of HenryClay, and never voted for any other democrat for high office afterJackson.My mother's family lived in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, for severalgenerations.  I have little information about her ancestors.  Her familytook no interest in genealogy, so that my grandfather, who died when Iwas sixteen years old, knew only back to his grandfather.  On the otherside, my father took a great interest in the subject, and in hisresearches, he found that there was an entailed estate in Windsor,Connecticut, belonging to the family, to which his nephew, Lawson Grant--still living--was the heir.  He was so much interested in the subjectthat he got his nephew to empower him to act in the matter, and in 1832or 1833, when I was a boy ten or eleven years old, he went to Windsor,proved the title beyond dispute, and perfected the claim of the ownersfor a consideration--three thousand dollars, I think.  I remember thecircumstance well, and remember, too, hearing him say on his return thathe found some widows living on the property, who had little or nothingbeyond their homes.  From these he refused to receive any recompense.My mother's father, John Simpson, moved from Montgomery County,Pennsylvania, to Clermont County, Ohio, about the year 1819, taking withhim his four children, three daughters and one son.  My mother, HannahSimpson, was the third of these children, and was then over twenty yearsof age.  Her oldest sister was at that time married, and had severalchildren.  She still lives in Clermont County at this writing, October5th, 1884, and is over ninety ears of age.  Until her memory failed her,a few years ago, she thought the country ruined beyond recovery when theDemocratic party lost control in 1860.  Her family, which was large,inherited her views, with the exception of one son who settled inKentucky before the war.  He was the only one of the children whoentered the volunteer service to suppress the rebellion.Her brother, next of age and now past eighty-eight, is also still livingin Clermont County, within a few miles of the old homestead, and is asactive in mind as ever.  He was a supporter of the Government during thewar, and remains a firm believer, that national success by theDemocratic party means irretrievable ruin.In June, 1821, my father, Jesse R. Grant, married Hannah Simpson.  I wasborn on the 27th of April, 1822, at Point Pleasant, Clermont County,Ohio.  In the fall of 1823 we moved to Georgetown, the county seat ofBrown, the adjoining county east.  This place remained my home, until atthe age of seventeen, in 1839, I went to West Point.The schools, at the time of which I write, were very indifferent.  Therewere no free schools, and none in which the scholars were classified.They were all supported by subscription, and a single teacher--who wasoften a man or a woman incapable of teaching much, even if they impartedall they knew--would have thirty or forty scholars, male and female,from the infant learning the A B C's up to the young lady of eighteenand the boy of twenty, studying the highest branches taught--the threeR's, 'Reading, 'Riting, 'Rithmetic.'  I never saw an algebra, or othermathematical work higher than the arithmetic, in Georgetown, until afterI was appointed to West Point.  I then bought a work on algebra inCincinnati; but having no teacher it was Greek to me.My life in Georgetown was uneventful.  From the age of five or six untilseventeen, I attended the subscription schools of the village, exceptduring the winters of 1836-7 and 1838-9.  The former period was spent inMaysville, Kentucky, attending the school of Richardson and Rand; thelatter in Ripley, Ohio, at a private school.  I was not studious inhabit, and probably did not make progress enough to compensate for theoutlay for board and tuition.  At all events both winters were spent ingoing over the same old arithmetic which I knew every word of before,and repeating:  'A noun is the name of a thing,' which I had also heardmy Georgetown teachers repeat, until I had come to believe it--but Icast no reflections upon my old teacher, Richardson. He turned outbright scholars from his school, many of whom have filled conspicuousplaces in the service of their States.  Two of my contemporaries there--who, I believe, never attended any other institution of learning--haveheld seats in Congress, and one, if not both, other high offices; theseare Wadsworth and Brewster.My father was, from my earliest recollection, in comfortablecircumstances, considering the times, his place of residence, and thecommunity in which he lived.  Mindful of his own lack of facilities foracquiring an education, his greatest desire in maturer years was for theeducation of his children. Consequently, as stated before, I nevermissed a quarter from school from the time I was old enough to attendtill the time of leaving home.  This did not exempt me from labor.  Inmy early days, every one labored more or less, in the region where myyouth was spent, and more in proportion to their private means.  It wasonly the very poor who were exempt.  While my father carried on themanufacture of leather and worked at the trade himself, he owned andtilled considerable land.  I detested the trade, preferring almost anyother labor; but I was fond of agriculture, and of all employment inwhich horses were used.  We had, among other lands, fifty acres offorest within a mile of the village.  In the fall of the year chopperswere employed to cut enough wood to last a twelve-month.  When I wasseven or eight years of age, I began hauling all the wood used in thehouse and shops.  I could not load it on the wagons, of course, at thattime, but I could drive, and the choppers would load, and some one atthe house unload.  When about eleven years old, I was strong enough tohold a plough.  From that age until seventeen I did all the work donewith horses, such as breaking up the land, furrowing, ploughing corn andpotatoes, bringing in the crops when harvested, hauling all the wood,besides tending two or three horses, a cow or two, and sawing wood forstoves, etc., while still attending school.  For this I was compensatedby the fact that there was never any scolding or punishing by myparents; no objection to rational enjoyments, such as fishing, going tothe creek a mile away to swim in summer, taking a horse and visiting mygrandparents in the adjoining county, fifteen miles off, skating on theice in winter, or taking a horse and sleigh when there was snow on theground.While still quite young I had visited Cincinnati, forty-five miles away,several times, alone; also Maysville, Kentucky, often, and onceLouisville.  The journey to Louisville was a big one for a boy of thatday.  I had also gone once with a two-horse carriage to Chilicothe,about seventy miles, with a neighbor's family, who were removing toToledo, Ohio, and returned alone; and had gone once, in like manner, toFlat Rock, Kentucky, about seventy miles away.  On this latter occasionI was fifteen years of age. 
ISFP	 While at Flat Rock, at the house of a Mr.Payne, whom I was visiting with his brother, a neighbor of ours inGeorgetown, I saw a very fine saddle horse, which I rather coveted, andproposed to Mr. Payne, the owner, to trade him for one of the two I wasdriving.  Payne hesitated to trade with a boy, but asking his brotherabout it, the latter told him that it would be all right, that I wasallowed to do as I pleased with the horses.  I was seventy miles fromhome, with a carriage to take back, and Mr. Payne said he did not knowthat his horse had ever had a collar on.  I asked to have him hitched toa farm wagon and we would soon see whether he would work.  It was soonevident that the horse had never worn harness before; but he showed noviciousness, and I expressed a confidence that I could manage him.  Atrade was at once struck, I receiving ten dollars difference.The next day Mr. Payne, of Georgetown, and I started on our return.  Wegot along very well for a few miles, when we encountered a ferocious dogthat frightened the horses and made them run.  The new animal kicked atevery jump he made.  I got the horses stopped, however, before anydamage was done, and without running into anything.  After giving them alittle rest, to quiet their fears, we started again.  That instant thenew horse kicked, and started to run once more.  The road we were on,struck the turnpike within half a mile of the point where the secondrunaway commenced, and there there was an embankment twenty or more feetdeep on the opposite side of the pike.  I got the horses stopped on thevery brink of the precipice.  My new horse was terribly frightened andtrembled like an aspen; but he was not half so badly frightened as mycompanion, Mr. Payne, who deserted me after this last experience, andtook passage on a freight wagon for Maysville.  Every time I attemptedto start, my new horse would commence to kick.  I was in quite a dilemmafor a time.  Once in Maysville I could borrow a horse from an uncle wholived there; but I was more than a day's travel from that point.Finally I took out my bandanna--the style of handkerchief in universaluse then--and with this blindfolded my horse.  In this way I reachedMaysville safely the next day, no doubt much to the surprise of myfriend.  Here I borrowed a horse from my uncle, and the following day weproceeded on our journey.About half my school-days in Georgetown were spent at the school of JohnD. White, a North Carolinian, and the father of Chilton White whorepresented the district in Congress for one term during the rebellion.Mr. White was always a Democrat in politics, and Chilton followed hisfather.  He had two older brothers--all three being school-mates of mineat their father's school--who did not go the same way.  The secondbrother died before the rebellion began; he was a Whig, and afterwards aRepublican.  His oldest brother was a Republican and brave soldierduring the rebellion.  Chilton is reported as having told of an earlierhorse-trade of mine.  As he told the story, there was a Mr. Ralstonliving within a few miles of the village, who owned a colt which I verymuch wanted.  My father had offered twenty dollars for it, but Ralstonwanted twenty-five.  I was so anxious to have the colt, that after theowner left, I begged to be allowed to take him at the price demanded.My father yielded, but said twenty dollars was all the horse was worth,and told me to offer that price; if it was not accepted I was to offertwenty-two and a half, and if that would not get him, to give thetwenty-five.  I at once mounted a horse and went for the colt.  When Igot to Mr. Ralston's house, I said to him:  'Papa says I may offer youtwenty dollars for the colt, but if you won't take that, I am to offertwenty-two and a half, and if you won't take that, to give youtwenty-five.'  It would not require a Connecticut man to guess the pricefinally agreed upon.  This story is nearly true.  I certainly showedvery plainly that I had come for the colt and meant to have him.  Icould not have been over eight years old at the time.  This transactioncaused me great heart-burning. The story got out among the boys of thevillage, and it was a long time before I heard the last of it.  Boysenjoy the misery of their companions, at least village boys in that daydid, and in later life I have found that all adults are not free fromthe peculiarity.  I kept the horse until he was four years old, when hewent blind, and I sold him for twenty dollars.  When I went to Maysvilleto school, in 1836, at the age of fourteen, I recognized my colt as oneof the blind horses working on the tread-wheel of the ferry-boat.I have describes enough of my early life to give an impression of thewhole.  I did not like to work; but I did as much of it, while young, asgrown men can be hired to do in these days, and attended school at thesame time.  I had as many privileges as any boy in the village, andprobably more than most of them.  I have no recollection of ever havingbeen punished at home, either by scolding or by the rod.  But at schoolthe case was different.  The rod was freely used there, and I was notexempt from its influence.  I can see John D. White--the school teacher--now, with his long beech switch always in his hand.  It was not alwaysthe same one, either.  Switches were brought in bundles, from a beechwood near the school house, by the boys for whose benefit they wereintended.  Often a whole bundle would be used up in a single day.  Inever had any hard feelings against my teacher, either while attendingthe school, or in later years when reflecting upon my experience.  Mr.White was a kindhearted man, and was much respected by the community inwhich he lived.  He only followed the universal custom of the period,and that under which he had received his own education.
ISFP	 II.WEST POINT--GRADUATION.In the winter of 1838-9 I was attending school at Ripley, only ten milesdistant from Georgetown, but spent the Christmas holidays at home.During this vacation my father received a letter from the HonorableThomas Morris, then United States Senator from Ohio.  When he read it hesaid to me, 'Ulysses, I believe you are going to receive theappointment.'  'What appointment?'  I inquired.  'To West Point; I haveapplied for it.'  'But I won't go,' I said.  He said he thought I would,AND I THOUGHT SO TOO, IF HE DID.  I really had no objection to going toWest Point, except that I had a very exalted idea of the acquirementsnecessary to get through.  I did not believe I possessed them, and couldnot bear the idea of failing.  There had been four boys from ourvillage, or its immediate neighborhood, who had been graduated from WestPoint, and never a failure of any one appointed from Georgetown, exceptin the case of the one whose place I was to take.  He was the son of Dr.Bailey, our nearest and most intimate neighbor.  Young Bailey had beenappointed in 1837.  Finding before the January examination following,that he could not pass, he resigned and went to a private school, andremained there until the following year, when he was reappointed.Before the next examination he was dismissed.  Dr. Bailey was a proudand sensitive man, and felt the failure of his son so keenly that heforbade his return home.  There were no telegraphs in those days todisseminate news rapidly, no railroads west of the Alleghanies, and butfew east; and above all, there were no reporters prying into otherpeople's private affairs.  Consequently it did not become generallyknown that there was a vacancy at West Point from our district until Iwas appointed.  I presume Mrs. Bailey confided to my mother the factthat Bartlett had been dismissed, and that the doctor had forbidden hisson's return home.The Honorable Thomas L. Hamer, one of the ablest men Ohio ever produced,was our member of Congress at the time, and had the right of nomination.He and my father had been members of the same debating society (wherethey were generally pitted on opposite sides), and intimate personalfriends from their early manhood up to a few years before.  In politicsthey differed. Hamer was a life-long Democrat, while my father was aWhig. They had a warm discussion, which finally became angry--over someact of President Jackson, the removal of the deposit of public moneys, Ithink--after which they never spoke until after my appointment.  I knowboth of them felt badly over this estrangement, and would have been gladat any time to come to a reconciliation; but neither would make theadvance.  Under these circumstances my father would not write to Hamerfor the appointment, but he wrote to Thomas Morris, United StatesSenator from Ohio, informing him that there was a vacancy at West Pointfrom our district, and that he would be glad if I could be appointed tofill it.  This letter, I presume, was turned over to Mr. Hamer, and, asthere was no other applicant, he cheerfully appointed me.  This healedthe breach between the two, never after reopened.Besides the argument used by my father in favor of my going to WestPoint--that 'he thought I would go'--there was another very stronginducement. 
ISFP	 I had always a great desire to travel.  I was already thebest travelled boy in Georgetown, except the sons of one man, JohnWalker, who had emigrated to Texas with his family, and immigrated backas soon as he could get the means to do so.  In his short stay in Texashe acquired a very different opinion of the country from what one wouldform going there now.I had been east to Wheeling, Virginia, and north to the Western Reserve,in Ohio, west to Louisville, and south to Bourbon County, Kentucky,besides having driven or ridden pretty much over the whole countrywithin fifty miles of home.  Going to West Point would give me theopportunity of visiting the two great cities of the continent,Philadelphia and New York.  This was enough.  When these places werevisited I would have been glad to have had a steamboat or railroadcollision, or any other accident happen, by which I might have receiveda temporary injury sufficient to make me ineligible, for a time, toenter the Academy.  Nothing of the kind occurred, and I had to face themusic.Georgetown has a remarkable record for a western village.  It is, andhas been from its earliest existence, a democratic town.  There wasprobably no time during the rebellion when, if the opportunity couldhave been afforded, it would not have voted for Jefferson Davis forPresident of the United States, over Mr. Lincoln, or any otherrepresentative of his party; unless it was immediately after some ofJohn Morgan's men, in his celebrated raid through Ohio, spent a fewhours in the village.  The rebels helped themselves to whatever theycould find, horses, boots and shoes, especially horses, and many orderedmeals to be prepared for them by the families.  This was no doubt a farpleasanter duty for some families than it would have been to render alike service for Union soldiers.  The line between the Rebel and Unionelement in Georgetown was so marked that it led to divisions even in thechurches.  There were churches in that part of Ohio where treason waspreached regularly, and where, to secure membership, hostility to thegovernment, to the war and to the liberation of the slaves, was far moreessential than a belief in the authenticity or credibility of the Bible.There were men in Georgetown who filled all the requirements formembership in these churches.Yet this far-off western village, with a population, including old andyoung, male and female, of about one thousand--about enough for theorganization of a single regiment if all had been men capable of bearingarms--furnished the Union army four general officers and one colonel,West Point graduates, and nine generals and field officers ofVolunteers, that I can think of. Of the graduates from West Point, allhad citizenship elsewhere at the breaking out of the rebellion, exceptpossibly General A. V. Kautz, who had remained in the army from hisgraduation.  Two of the colonels also entered the service from otherlocalities.  The other seven, General McGroierty, Colonels White, Fyffe,Loudon and Marshall, Majors King and Bailey, were all residents ofGeorgetown when the war broke out, and all of them, who were alive atthe close, returned there.  Major Bailey was the cadet who had precededme at West Point.  He was killed in West Virginia, in his firstengagement.  As far as I know, every boy who has entered West Point fromthat village since my time has been graduated.I took passage on a steamer at Ripley, Ohio, for Pittsburg, about themiddle of May, 1839.  Western boats at that day did not make regulartrips at stated times, but would stop anywhere, and for any length oftime, for passengers or freight.  I have myself been detained two orthree days at a place after steam was up, the gang planks, all but one,drawn in, and after the time advertised for starting had expired.  Onthis occasion we had no vexatious delays, and in about three daysPittsburg was reached.  From Pittsburg I chose passage by the canal toHarrisburg, rather than by the more expeditious stage.  This gave abetter opportunity of enjoying the fine scenery of Western Pennsylvania,and I had rather a dread of reaching my destination at all.  At thattime the canal was much patronized by travellers, and, with thecomfortable packets of the period, no mode of conveyance could be morepleasant, when time was not an object.  From Harrisburg to Philadelphiathere was a railroad, the first I had ever seen, except the one on whichI had just crossed the summit of the Alleghany Mountains, and over whichcanal boats were transported.  In travelling by the road fromHarrisburg, I thought the perfection of rapid transit had been reached.We travelled at least eighteen miles an hour, when at full speed, andmade the whole distance averaging probably as much as twelve miles anhour.  This seemed like annihilating space.  I stopped five days inPhiladelphia, saw about every street in the city, attended the theatre,visited Girard College (which was then in course of construction), andgot reprimanded from home afterwards, for dallying by the way so long.My sojourn in New York was shorter, but long enough to enable me to seethe city very well.  I reported at West Point on the 30th or 31st ofMay, and about two weeks later passed my examination for admission,without difficulty, very much to my surprise.A military life had no charms for me, and I had not the faintest idea ofstaying in the army even if I should be graduated, which I did notexpect.  The encampment which preceded the commencement of academicstudies was very wearisome and uninteresting.  When the 28th of Augustcame--the date for breaking up camp and going into barracks--I felt asthough I had been at West Point always, and that if I staid tograduation, I would have to remain always. 
ISFP	 I did not take hold of mystudies with avidity, in fact I rarely ever read over a lesson thesecond time during my entire cadetship.  I could not sit in my roomdoing nothing.  There is a fine library connected with the Academy fromwhich cadets can get books to read in their quarters.  I devoted moretime to these, than to books relating to the course of studies.  Much ofthe time, I am sorry to say, was devoted to novels, but not those of atrashy sort.  I read all of Bulwer's then published, Cooper's,Marryat's, Scott's, Washington Irving's works, Lever's, and many othersthat I do not now remember.  Mathematics was very easy to me, so thatwhen January came, I passed the examination, taking a good standing inthat branch.  In French, the only other study at that time in the firstyear's course, my standing was very low.  In fact, if the class had beenturned the other end foremost I should have been near head.  I neversucceeded in getting squarely at either end of my class, in any onestudy, during the four years.  I came near it in French, artillery,infantry and cavalry tactics, and conduct.Early in the session of the Congress which met in December, 1839, a billwas discussed abolishing the Military Academy.  I saw in this anhonorable way to obtain a discharge, and read the debates with muchinterest, but with impatience at the delay in taking action, for I wasselfish enough to favor the bill.  It never passed, and a year later,although the time hung drearily with me, I would have been sorry to haveseen it succeed.  My idea then was to get through the course, secure adetail for a few years as assistant professor of mathematics at theAcademy, and afterwards obtain a permanent position as professor in somerespectable college; but circumstances always did shape my coursedifferent from my plans.At the end of two years the class received the usual furlough, extendingfrom the close of the June examination to the 28th of August.  This Ienjoyed beyond any other period of my life.  My father had sold out hisbusiness in Georgetown--where my youth had been spent, and to which myday-dreams carried me back as my future home, if I should ever be ableto retire on a competency.  He had moved to Bethel, only twelve milesaway, in the adjoining county of Clermont, and had bought a young horsethat had never been in harness, for my special use under the saddleduring my furlough.  Most of my time was spent among my oldschool-mates--these ten weeks were shorter than one week at West Point.Persons acquainted with the Academy know that the corps of cadets isdivided into four companies for the purpose of military exercises.These companies are officered from the cadets, the superintendent andcommandant selecting the officers for their military bearing andqualifications.  The adjutant, quartermaster, four captains and twelvelieutenants are taken from the first, or Senior class; the sergeantsfrom the second, or junior class; and the corporals from the third, orSophomore class.  I had not been 'called out' as a corporal, but when Ireturned from furlough I found myself the last but one--about mystanding in all the tactics--of eighteen sergeants.  The promotion wastoo much for me.  That year my standing in the class--as shown by thenumber of demerits of the year--was about the same as it was among thesergeants, and I was dropped, and served the fourth year as a private.During my first year's encampment General Scott visited West Point, andreviewed the cadets.  With his commanding figure, his quite colossalsize and showy uniform, I thought him the finest specimen of manhood myeyes had ever beheld, and the most to be envied.  I could never resemblehim in appearance, but I believe I did have a presentiment for a momentthat some day I should occupy his place on review--although I had nointention then of remaining in the army.  My experience in a horse-tradeten years before, and the ridicule it caused me, were too fresh in mymind for me to communicate this presentiment to even my most intimatechum.  The next summer Martin Van Buren, then President of the UnitedStates, visited West Point and reviewed the cadets; he did not impressme with the awe which Scott had inspired.  In fact I regarded GeneralScott and Captain C. F. Smith, the Commandant of Cadets, as the two menmost to be envied in the nation.  I retained a high regard for both upto the day of their death.The last two years wore away more rapidly than the first two, but theystill seemed about five times as long as Ohio years, to me.  At last allthe examinations were passed, and the members of the class were calledupon to record their choice of arms of service and regiments.  I wasanxious to enter the cavalry, or dragoons as they were then called, butthere was only one regiment of dragoons in the Army at that time, andattached to that, besides the full complement of officers, there were atleast four brevet second lieutenants.  I recorded therefore my firstchoice, dragoons; second, 4th infantry; and got the latter.  Again therewas a furlough--or, more properly speaking, leave of absence for theclass were now commissioned officers--this time to the end of September.Again I went to Ohio to spend my vacation among my old school-mates; andagain I found a fine saddle horse purchased for my special use, besidesa horse and buggy that I could drive--but I was not in a physicalcondition to enjoy myself quite as well as on the former occasion.  Forsix months before graduation I had had a desperate cough ('Tyler's grip'it was called), and I was very much reduced, weighing but one hundredand seventeen pounds, just my weight at entrance, though I had grown sixinches in stature in the mean time.  There was consumption in myfather's family, two of his brothers having died of that disease, whichmade my symptoms more alarming.  The brother and sister next youngerthan myself died, during the rebellion, of the same disease, and Iseemed the most promising subject for it of the three in 1843.Having made alternate choice of two different arms of service withdifferent uniforms, I could not get a uniform suit until notified of myassignment.  I left my measurement with a tailor, with directions not tomake the uniform until I notified him whether it was to be for infantryor dragoons.  Notice did not reach me for several weeks, and then ittook at least a week to get the letter of instructions to the tailor andtwo more to make the clothes and have them sent to me.  This was a timeof great suspense.  I was impatient to get on my uniform and see how itlooked, and probably wanted my old school-mates, particularly the girls,to see me in it.The conceit was knocked out of me by two little circumstances thathappened soon after the arrival of the clothes, which gave me a distastefor military uniform that I never recovered from.  Soon after thearrival of the suit I donned it, and put off for Cincinnati onhorseback.  While I was riding along a street of that city, imaginingthat every one was looking at me, with a feeling akin to mine when Ifirst saw General Scott, a little urchin, bareheaded, footed, with dirtyand ragged pants held up by bare a single gallows--that's whatsuspenders were called then--and a shirt that had not seen a wash-tubfor weeks, turned to me and cried:  'Soldier! will you work?  No,sir--ee; I'll sell my shirt first!!' The horse trade and its direconsequences were recalled to mind.The other circumstance occurred at home.  Opposite our house in Bethelstood the old stage tavern where 'man and beast' found accommodation,The stable-man was rather dissipated, but possessed of some humor.  Onmy return I found him parading the streets, and attending in the stable,barefooted, but in a pair of sky-blue nankeen pantaloons--just the colorof my uniform trousers--with a strip of white cotton sheeting sewed downthe outside seams in imitation of mine.  The joke was a huge one in themind of many of the people, and was much enjoyed by them; but I did notappreciate it so highly.During the remainder of my leave of absence, my time was spent invisiting friends in Georgetown and Cincinnati, and occasionally othertowns in that part of the State.
ISFP	 III.ARMY LIFE--CAUSES OF THE MEXICAN WAR--CAMP SALUBRITY.On the 30th of September I reported for duty at Jefferson Barracks, St.Louis, with the 4th United States infantry.  It was the largest militarypost in the country at that time, being garrisoned by sixteen companiesof infantry, eight of the 3d regiment, the remainder of the 4th.Colonel Steven Kearney, one of the ablest officers of the day, commandedthe post, and under him discipline was kept at a high standard, butwithout vexatious rules or regulations.  Every drill and roll-call hadto be attended, but in the intervals officers were permitted to enjoythemselves, leaving the garrison, and going where they pleased, withoutmaking written application to state where they were going for how long,etc., so that they were back for their next duty.  It did seem to me, inmy early army days, that too many of the older officers, when they cameto command posts, made it a study to think what orders they couldpublish to annoy their subordinates and render them uncomfortable.  Inoticed, however, a few years later, when the Mexican war broke out,that most of this class of officers discovered they were possessed ofdisabilities which entirely incapacitated them for active field service.They had the moral courage to proclaim it, too.  They were right; butthey did not always give their disease the right name.At West Point I had a class-mate--in the last year of our studies he wasroom-mate also--F. T. Dent, whose family resided some five miles west ofJefferson Barracks.  Two of his unmarried brothers were living at homeat that time, and as I had taken with me from Ohio, my horse, saddle andbridle, I soon found my way out to White Haven, the name of the Dentestate.  As I found the family congenial my visits became frequent.There were at home, besides the young men, two daughters, one a schoolmiss of fifteen, the other a girl of eight or nine.  There was still anolder daughter of seventeen, who had been spending several years atboarding-school in St. Louis, but who, though through school, had notyet returned home.  She was spending the winter in the city withconnections, the family of Colonel John O'Fallon, well known in St.Louis.  In February she returned to her country home.  After that I donot know but my visits became more frequent; they certainly did becomemore enjoyable.  We would often take walks, or go on horseback to visitthe neighbors, until I became quite well acquainted in that vicinity.Sometimes one of the brothers would accompany us, sometimes one of theyounger sisters.  If the 4th infantry had remained at Jefferson Barracksit is possible, even probable, that this life might have continued forsome years without my finding out that there was anything serious thematter with me; but in the following May a circumstance occurred whichdeveloped my sentiment so palpably that there was no mistaking it.
ISFP	The annexation of Texas was at this time the subject of violentdiscussion in Congress, in the press, and by individuals.  Theadministration of President Tyler, then in power, was making the moststrenuous efforts to effect the annexation, which was, indeed, the greatand absorbing question of the day.  During these discussions the greaterpart of the single rifle regiment in the army--the 2d dragoons, whichhad been dismounted a year or two before, and designated 'DismountedRifles'--was stationed at Fort Jessup, Louisiana, some twenty-five mileseast of the Texas line, to observe the frontier.  About the 1st of Maythe 3d infantry was ordered from Jefferson Barracks to Louisiana, to gointo camp in the neighborhood of Fort Jessup, and there await furtherorders.  The troops were embarked on steamers and were on their way downthe Mississippi within a few days after the receipt of this order.About the time they started I obtained a leave of absence for twentydays to go to Ohio to visit my parents.  I was obliged to go to St.Louis to take a steamer for Louisville or Cincinnati, or the firststeamer going up the Ohio River to any point.  Before I left St. Louisorders were received at Jefferson Barracks for the 4th infantry tofollow the 3d.  A messenger was sent after me to stop my leaving; butbefore he could reach me I was off, totally ignorant of these events.  Aday or two after my arrival at Bethel I received a letter from aclassmate and fellow lieutenant in the 4th, informing me of thecircumstances related above, and advising me not to open any letter postmarked St. Louis or Jefferson Barracks, until the expiration of myleave, and saying that he would pack up my things and take them alongfor me.  His advice was not necessary, for no other letter was sent tome.  I now discovered that I was exceedingly anxious to get back toJefferson Barracks, and I understood the reason without explanation fromany one.  My leave of absence required me to report for duty, atJefferson Barracks, at the end of twenty days.  I knew my regiment hadgone up the Red River, but I was not disposed to break the letter of myleave; besides, if I had proceeded to Louisiana direct, I could not havereached there until after the expiration of my leave.  Accordingly, atthe end of the twenty days, I reported for duty to Lieutenant Ewell,commanding at Jefferson Barracks, handing him at the same time my leaveof absence.  After noticing the phraseology of the order--leaves ofabsence were generally worded, 'at the end of which time he will reportfor duty with his proper command'--he said he would give me an order tojoin my regiment in Louisiana.  I then asked for a few days' leavebefore starting, which he readily granted.  This was the same Ewell whoacquired considerable reputation as a Confederate general during therebellion.  He was a man much esteemed, and deservedly so, in the oldarmy, and proved himself a gallant and efficient officer in two wars--both in my estimation unholy.I immediately procured a horse and started for the country, taking nobaggage with me, of course.  There is an insignificant creek--theGravois--between Jefferson Barracks and the place to which I was going,and at that day there was not a bridge over it from its source to itsmouth.  There is not water enough in the creek at ordinary stages to runa coffee mill, and at low water there is none running whatever.  On thisoccasion it had been raining heavily, and, when the creek was reached, Ifound the banks full to overflowing, and the current rapid.  I looked atit a moment to consider what to do.  One of my superstitions had alwaysbeen when I started to go any where, or to do anything, not to turnback, or stop until the thing intended was accomplished.  I havefrequently started to go to places where I had never been and to which Idid not know the way, depending upon making inquiries on the road, andif I got past the place without knowing it, instead of turning back, Iwould go on until a road was found turning in the right direction, takethat, and come in by the other side.  So I struck into the stream, andin an instant the horse was swimming and I being carried down by thecurrent.  I headed the horse towards the other bank and soon reached it,wet through and without other clothes on that side of the stream.  Iwent on, however, to my destination and borrowed a dry suit from my--future--brother-in-law.  We were not of the same size, but the clothesanswered every purpose until I got more of my own.Before I returned I mustered up courage to make known, in the mostawkward manner imaginable, the discovery I had made on learning that the4th infantry had been ordered away from Jefferson Barracks.  The younglady afterwards admitted that she too, although until then she had neverlooked upon me other than as a visitor whose company was agreeable toher, had experienced a depression of spirits she could not account forwhen the regiment left.  Before separating it was definitely understoodthat at a convenient time we would join our fortunes, and not let theremoval of a regiment trouble us.  This was in May, 1844.  It was the22d of August, 1848, before the fulfilment of this agreement.  My dutieskept me on the frontier of Louisiana with the Army of Observation duringthe pendency of Annexation; and afterwards I was absent through the warwith Mexico, provoked by the action of the army, if not by theannexation itself. During that time there was a constant correspondencebetween Miss Dent and myself, but we only met once in the period of fouryears and three months. 
ISFP	 In May, 1845, I procured a leave for twentydays, visited St. Louis, and obtained the consent of the parents for theunion, which had not been asked for before.As already stated, it was never my intention to remain in the army long,but to prepare myself for a professorship in some college.  Accordingly,soon after I was settled at Jefferson Barracks, I wrote a letter toProfessor Church--Professor of Mathematics at West Point--requesting himto ask my designation as his assistant, when next a detail had to bemade. Assistant professors at West Point are all officers of the army,supposed to be selected for their special fitness for the particularbranch of study they are assigned to teach.  The answer from ProfessorChurch was entirely satisfactory, and no doubt I should have beendetailed a year or two later but for the Mexican War coming on.Accordingly I laid out for myself a course of studies to be pursued ingarrison, with regularity, if not persistency.  I reviewed my West Pointcourse of mathematics during the seven months at Jefferson Barracks, andread many valuable historical works, besides an occasional novel.  Tohelp my memory I kept a book in which I would write up, from time totime, my recollections of all I had read since last posting it.  Whenthe regiment was ordered away, I being absent at the time, my effectswere packed up by Lieutenant Haslett, of the 4th infantry, and takenalong.  I never saw my journal after, nor did I ever keep another,except for a portion of the time while travelling abroad.  Often since afear has crossed my mind lest that book might turn up yet, and fall intothe hands of some malicious person who would publish it.  I know itsappearance would cause me as much heart-burning as my youthfulhorse-trade, or the later rebuke for wearing uniform clothes.The 3d infantry had selected camping grounds on the reservation at FortJessup, about midway between the Red River and the Sabine.  Our ordersrequired us to go into camp in the same neighborhood, and await furtherinstructions.  Those authorized to do so selected a place in the pinewoods, between the old town of Natchitoches and Grand Ecore, about threemiles from each, and on high ground back from the river.  The place wasgiven the name of Camp Salubrity, and proved entitled to it. The campwas on a high, sandy, pine ridge, with spring branches in the valley, infront and rear.  The springs furnished an abundance of cool, pure water,and the ridge was above the flight of mosquitoes, which abound in thatregion in great multitudes and of great voracity.  In the valley theyswarmed in myriads, but never came to the summit of the ridge.  Theregiment occupied this camp six months before the first death occurred,and that was caused by an accident.There was no intimation given that the removal of the 3d and 4thregiments of infantry to the western border of Louisiana was occasionedin any way by the prospective annexation of Texas, but it was generallyunderstood that such was the case. Ostensibly we were intended toprevent filibustering into Texas, but really as a menace to Mexico incase she appeared to contemplate war.  Generally the officers of thearmy were indifferent whether the annexation was consummated or not; butnot so all of them.  For myself, I was bitterly opposed to the measure,and to this day regard the war, which resulted, as one of the mostunjust ever waged by a stronger against a weaker nation.  It was aninstance of a republic following the bad example of European monarchies,in not considering justice in their desire to acquire additionalterritory.  Texas was originally a state belonging to the republic ofMexico.  It extended from the Sabine River on the east to the Rio Grandeon the west, and from the Gulf of Mexico on the south and east to theterritory of the United States and New Mexico--another Mexican state atthat time--on the north and west.  An empire in territory, it had but avery sparse population, until settled by Americans who had receivedauthority from Mexico to colonize. These colonists paid very littleattention to the supreme government, and introduced slavery into thestate almost from the start, though the constitution of Mexico did not,nor does it now, sanction that institution.  Soon they set up anindependent government of their own, and war existed, between Texas andMexico, in name from that time until 1836, when active hostilities verynearly ceased upon the capture of Santa Anna, the Mexican President.Before long, however, the same people--who with permission of Mexico hadcolonized Texas, and afterwards set up slavery there, and then secededas soon as they felt strong enough to do so--offered themselves and theState to the United States, and in 1845 their offer was accepted.  Theoccupation, separation and annexation were, from the inception of themovement to its final consummation, a conspiracy to acquire territoryout of which slave states might be formed for the American Union.Even if the annexation itself could be justified, the manner in whichthe subsequent war was forced upon Mexico cannot.  The fact is,annexationists wanted more territory than they could possibly lay anyclaim to, as part of the new acquisition. Texas, as an independentState, never had exercised jurisdiction over the territory between theNueces River and the Rio Grande. Mexico had never recognized theindependence of Texas, and maintained that, even if independent, theState had no claim south of the Nueces.  I am aware that a treaty, madeby the Texans with Santa Anna while he was under duress, ceded all theterritory between the Nueces and the Rio Grande--, but he was a prisonerof war when the treaty was made, and his life was in jeopardy.  He knew,too, that he deserved execution at the hands of the Texans, if theyshould ever capture him.  The Texans, if they had taken his life, wouldhave only followed the example set by Santa Anna himself a few yearsbefore, when he executed the entire garrison of the Alamo and thevillagers of Goliad.In taking military possession of Texas after annexation, the army ofoccupation, under General Taylor, was directed to occupy the disputedterritory.  The army did not stop at the Nueces and offer to negotiatefor a settlement of the boundary question, but went beyond, apparentlyin order to force Mexico to initiate war.  It is to the credit of theAmerican nation, however, that after conquering Mexico, and whilepractically holding the country in our possession, so that we could haveretained the whole of it, or made any terms we chose, we paid a roundsum for the additional territory taken; more than it was worth, or waslikely to be, to Mexico.  To us it was an empire and of incalculablevalue; but it might have been obtained by other means.  The Southernrebellion was largely the outgrowth of the Mexican war.  Nations, likeindividuals, are punished for their transgressions.  We got ourpunishment in the most sanguinary and expensive war of modern times.The 4th infantry went into camp at Salubrity in the month of May, 1844,with instructions, as I have said, to await further orders.  At first,officers and men occupied ordinary tents.  As the summer heat increasedthese were covered by sheds to break the rays of the sun.  The summerwas whiled away in social enjoyments among the officers, in visitingthose stationed at, and near, Fort Jessup, twenty-five miles away,visiting the planters on the Red River, and the citizens of Natchitochesand Grand Ecore.  There was much pleasant intercourse between theinhabitants and the officers of the army.  I retain very agreeablerecollections of my stay at Camp Salubrity, and of the acquaintancesmade there, and no doubt my feeling is shared by the few officers livingwho were there at the time.  I can call to mind only two officers of the4th infantry, besides myself, who were at Camp Salubrity with theregiment, who are now alive.With a war in prospect, and belonging to a regiment that had an unusualnumber of officers detailed on special duty away from the regiment, myhopes of being ordered to West Point as instructor vanished.  At thetime of which I now write, officers in the quartermaster's, commissary'sand adjutant--general's departments were appointed from the line of thearmy, and did not vacate their regimental commissions until theirregimental and staff commissions were for the same grades.  Generallylieutenants were appointed to captaincies to fill vacancies in the staffcorps.  If they should reach a captaincy in the line before they arrivedat a majority in the staff, they would elect which commission they wouldretain.  In the 4th infantry, in 1844, at least six line officers wereon duty in the staff, and therefore permanently detached from theregiment.  Under these circumstances I gave up everything like a specialcourse of reading, and only read thereafter for my own amusement, andnot very much for that, until the war was over.  I kept a horse androde, and staid out of doors most of the time by day, and entirelyrecovered from the cough which I had carried from West Point, and fromall indications of consumption.  I have often thought that my life wassaved, and my health restored, by exercise and exposure, enforced by anadministrative act, and a war, both of which I disapproved.As summer wore away, and cool days and colder nights came upon us, thetents. We were occupying ceased to afford comfortable quarters; and'further orders' not reaching us, we began to look about to remedy thehardship.  Men were put to work getting out timber to build huts, and ina very short time all were comfortably housed--privates as well asofficers.  The outlay by the government in accomplishing this wasnothing, or nearly nothing.  The winter was spent more agreeably thanthe summer had been.  There were occasional parties given by theplanters along the 'coast'--as the bottom lands on the Red River werecalled.  The climate was delightful.Near the close of the short session of Congress of 1844-5, the bill forthe annexation of Texas to the United States was passed.  It reachedPresident Tyler on the 1st of March, 1845, and promptly received hisapproval.  When the news reached us we began to look again for 'furtherorders.'  They did not arrive promptly, and on the 1st of May followingI asked and obtained a leave of absence for twenty days, for the purposeof visiting--St. Louis.  The object of this visit has been beforestated.Early in July the long expected orders were received, but they only tookthe regiment to New Orleans Barracks.  We reached there before themiddle of the month, and again waited weeks for still further orders.The yellow fever was raging in New Orleans during the time we remainedthere, and the streets of the city had the appearance of a continuouswell-observed Sunday.  I recollect but one occasion when this observanceseemed to be broken by the inhabitants.  One morning about daylight Ihappened to be awake, and, hearing the discharge of a rifle not far off,I looked out to ascertain where the sound came from.  I observed acouple of clusters of men near by, and learned afterwards that 'it wasnothing; only a couple of gentlemen deciding a difference of opinionwith rifles, at twenty paces.'  I do not remember if either was killed,or even hurt, but no doubt the question of difference was settledsatisfactorily, and 'honorably,' in the estimation of the partiesengaged.  I do not believe I ever would have the courage to fight aduel.  If any man should wrong me to the extent of my being willing tokill him, I would not be willing to give him the choice of weapons withwhich it should be done, and of the time, place and distance separatingus, when I executed him.  If I should do another such a wrong as tojustify him in killing me, I would make any reasonable atonement withinmy power, if convinced of the wrong done.  I place my opposition toduelling on higher grounds than here stated.  No doubt a majority of theduels fought have been for want of moral courage on the part of thoseengaged to decline.At Camp Salubrity, and when we went to New Orleans Barracks, the 4thinfantry was commanded by Colonel Vose, then an old gentleman who hadnot commanded on drill for a number of years.  He was not a man todiscover infirmity in the presence of danger.  It now appeared that warwas imminent, and he felt that it was his duty to brush up his tactics.Accordingly, when we got settled down at our new post, he took commandof the regiment at a battalion drill.  Only two or three evolutions hadbeen gone through when he dismissed the battalion, and, turning to go tohis own quarters, dropped dead.  He had not been complaining of illhealth, but no doubt died of heart disease.  He was a most estimableman, of exemplary habits, and by no means the author of his own disease.
ISFP	 IV.CORPUS CHRISTI--MEXICAN SMUGGLING--SPANISH RULE IN MEXICO--SUPPLYINGTRANSPORTATION.Early in September the regiment left New Orleans for Corpus Christi, nowin Texas.  Ocean steamers were not then common, and the passage was madein sailing vessels.  At that time there was not more than three feet ofwater in the channel at the outlet of Corpus Christi Bay; thedebarkation, therefore, had to take place by small steamers, and at anisland in the channel called Shell Island, the ships anchoring somemiles out from shore. This made the work slow, and as the army was onlysupplied with one or two steamers, it took a number of days to effectthe landing of a single regiment with its stores, camp and garrisonequipage, etc.  There happened to be pleasant weather while this wasgoing on, but the land-swell was so great that when the ship and steamerwere on opposite sides of the same wave they would be at considerabledistance apart.  The men and baggage were let down to a point higherthan the lower deck of the steamer, and when ship and steamer got intothe trough between the waves, and were close together, the load would bedrawn over the steamer and rapidly run down until it rested on the deck.After I had gone ashore, and had been on guard several days at ShellIsland, quite six miles from the ship, I had occasion for some reason orother to return on board.  While on the Suviah--I think that was thename of our vessel--I heard a tremendous racket at the other end of theship, and much and excited sailor language, such as 'damn your eyes,'etc.  In a moment or two the captain, who was an excitable little man,dying with consumption, and not weighing much over a hundred pounds,came running out, carrying a sabre nearly as large and as heavy as hewas, and crying, that his men had mutinied.  It was necessary to sustainthe captain without question, and in a few minutes all the sailorscharged with mutiny were in irons.  I rather felt for a time a wish thatI had not gone aboard just then.  As the men charged with mutinysubmitted to being placed in irons without resistance, I always doubtedif they knew that they had mutinied until they were told.By the time I was ready to leave the ship again I thought I had learnedenough of the working of the double and single pulley, by whichpassengers were let down from the upper deck of the ship to the steamerbelow, and determined to let myself down without assistance.  Withoutsaying anything of my intentions to any one, I mounted the railing, andtaking hold of the centre rope, just below the upper block, I put onefoot on the hook below the lower block, and stepped off just as I did sosome one called out 'hold on.'  It was too late.  I tried to 'hold on'with all my might, but my heels went up, and my head went down sorapidly that my hold broke, and I plunged head foremost into the water,some twenty-five feet below, with such velocity that it seemed to me Inever would stop.  When I came to the surface again, being a fairswimmer, and not having lost my presence of mind, I swam around until abucket was let down for me, and I was drawn up without a scratch orinjury. I do not believe there was a man on board who sympathized withme in the least when they found me uninjured.  I rather enjoyed the jokemyself. The captain of the Suviah died of his disease a few months later,and I believe before the mutineers were tried.  I hope they got clear,because, as before stated, I always thought the mutiny was all in thebrain of a very weak and sick man.After reaching shore, or Shell Island, the labor of getting to CorpusChristi was slow and tedious.  There was, if my memory serves me, butone small steamer to transport troops and baggage when the 4th infantryarrived.  Others were procured later.  The distance from Shell Island toCorpus Christi was some sixteen or eighteen miles.  The channel to thebay was so shallow that the steamer, small as it was, had to be draggedover the bottom when loaded.  Not more than one trip a day could beeffected.  Later this was remedied, by deepening the channel andincreasing the number of vessels suitable to its navigation.Corpus Christi is near the head of the bay of the same name, formed bythe entrance of the Nueces River into tide-water, and is on the westbank of that bay.  At the time of its first occupancy by United Statestroops there was a small Mexican hamlet there, containing probably lessthan one hundred souls. There was, in addition, a small American tradingpost, at which goods were sold to Mexican smugglers.  All goods were putup in compact packages of about one hundred pounds each, suitable forloading on pack mules.  Two of these packages made a load for anordinary Mexican mule, and three for the larger ones.  The bulk of thetrade was in leaf tobacco, and domestic cotton-cloths and calicoes.  TheMexicans had, before the arrival of the army, but little to offer inexchange except silver.  The trade in tobacco was enormous, consideringthe population to be supplied.  Almost every Mexican above the age often years, and many much younger, smoked the cigarette.  Nearly everyMexican carried a pouch of leaf tobacco, powdered by rolling in thehands, and a roll of corn husks to make wrappers.  The cigarettes weremade by the smokers as they used them.Up to the time of which I write, and for years afterwards--I think untilthe administration of President Juarez--the cultivation, manufacture andsale of tobacco constituted a government monopoly, and paid the bulk ofthe revenue collected from internal sources.  The price was enormouslyhigh, and made successful smuggling very profitable.  The difficulty ofobtaining tobacco is probably the reason why everybody, male and female,used it at that time.  I know from my own experience that when I was atWest Point, the fact that tobacco, in every form, was prohibited, andthe mere possession of the weed severely punished, made the majority ofthe cadets, myself included, try to acquire the habit of using it.  Ifailed utterly at the time and for many years afterward; but themajority accomplished the object of their youthful ambition.Under Spanish rule Mexico was prohibited from producing anything thatthe mother-country could supply.  This rule excluded the cultivation ofthe grape, olive and many other articles to which the soil and climatewere well adapted.  The country was governed for 'revenue only;' andtobacco, which cannot be raised in Spain, but is indigenous to Mexico,offered a fine instrumentality for securing this prime object ofgovernment.  The native population had been in the habit of using 'theweed' from a period, back of any recorded history of this continent.Bad habits--if not restrained by law or public opinion--spread morerapidly and universally than good ones, and the Spanish colonistsadopted the use of tobacco almost as generally as the natives.  Spain,therefore, in order to secure the largest revenue from this source,prohibited the cultivation, except in specified localities--and in theseplaces farmed out the privilege at a very high price.  The tobacco whenraised could only be sold to the government, and the price to theconsumer was limited only by the avarice of the authorities, and thecapacity of the people to pay.All laws for the government of the country were enacted in Spain, andthe officers for their execution were appointed by the Crown, and sentout to the New El Dorado.  The Mexicans had been brought up ignorant ofhow to legislate or how to rule. When they gained their independence,after many years of war, it was the most natural thing in the world thatthey should adopt as their own the laws then in existence.  The onlychange was, that Mexico became her own executor of the laws and therecipient of the revenues.  The tobacco tax, yielding so large a revenueunder the law as it stood, was one of the last, if not the very last, ofthe obnoxious imposts to be repealed.  Now, the citizens are allowed tocultivate any crops the soil will yield.  Tobacco is cheap, and everyquality can be produced. Its use is by no means so general as when Ifirst visited the country.Gradually the 'Army of Occupation' assembled at Corpus Christi.  When itwas all together it consisted of seven companies of the 2d regiment ofdragoons, four companies of light artillery, five regiments of infantry--the 3d, 4th, 5th, 7th and 8th--and one regiment of artillery acting asinfantry--not more than three thousand men in all.  General ZacharyTaylor commanded the whole.  There were troops enough in one body toestablish a drill and discipline sufficient to fit men and officers forall they were capable of in case of battle.  The rank and file werecomposed of men who had enlisted in time of peace, to serve for sevendollars a month, and were necessarily inferior as material to theaverage volunteers enlisted later in the war expressly to fight, andalso to the volunteers in the war for the preservation of the Union.The men engaged in the Mexican war were brave, and the officers of theregular army, from highest to lowest, were educated in their profession.A more efficient army for its number and armament, I do not believe everfought a battle than the one commanded by General Taylor in his firsttwo engagements on Mexican--or Texan soil.The presence of United States troops on the edge of the disputedterritory furthest from the Mexican settlements, was not sufficient toprovoke hostilities.  We were sent to provoke a fight, but it wasessential that Mexico should commence it.  It was very doubtful whetherCongress would declare war; but if Mexico should attack our troops, theExecutive could announce, 'Whereas, war exists by the acts of, etc.,'and prosecute the contest with vigor.  Once initiated there were but fewpublic men who would have the courage to oppose it.  Experience provesthat the man who obstructs a war in which his nation is engaged, nomatter whether right or wrong, occupies no enviable place in life orhistory.  Better for him, individually, to advocate 'war, pestilence,and famine,' than to act as obstructionist to a war already begun.  Thehistory of the defeated rebel will be honorable hereafter, compared withthat of the Northern man who aided him by conspiring against hisgovernment while protected by it.  The most favorable posthumous historythe stay-at-home traitor can hope for is--oblivion.Mexico showing no willingness to come to the Nueces to drive theinvaders from her soil, it became necessary for the 'invaders' toapproach to within a convenient distance to be struck. Accordingly,preparations were begun for moving the army to the Rio Grande, to apoint near Matamoras.  It was desirable to occupy a position near thelargest centre of population possible to reach, without absolutelyinvading territory to which we set up no claim whatever.The distance from Corpus Christi to Matamoras is about one hundred andfifty miles.  The country does not abound in fresh water, and the lengthof the marches had to be regulated by the distance between watersupplies.  Besides the streams, there were occasional pools, filledduring the rainy season, some probably made by the traders, whotravelled constantly between Corpus Christi and the Rio Grande, and someby the buffalo. There was not at that time a single habitation,cultivated field, or herd of domestic animals, between Corpus Christiand Matamoras.  It was necessary, therefore, to have a wagon trainsufficiently large to transport the camp and garrison equipage,officers' baggage, rations for the army, and part rations of grain forthe artillery horses and all the animals taken from the north, wherethey had been accustomed to having their forage furnished them.  Thearmy was but indifferently supplied with transportation.  Wagons andharness could easily be supplied from the north but mules and horsescould not so readily be brought.  The American traders and Mexicansmugglers came to the relief.  Contracts were made for mules at fromeight to eleven dollars each.  The smugglers furnished the animals, andtook their pay in goods of the description before mentioned.  I doubtwhether the Mexicans received in value from the traders five dollars perhead for the animals they furnished, and still more, whether they paidanything but their own time in procuring them.  Such is trade; such iswar.  The government paid in hard cash to the contractor the stipulatedprice.Between the Rio Grande and the Nueces there was at that time a largeband of wild horses feeding; as numerous, probably, as the band ofbuffalo roaming further north was before its rapid exterminationcommenced.  The Mexicans used to capture these in large numbers andbring them into the American settlements and sell them.  A picked animalcould be purchased at from eight to twelve dollars, but taken atwholesale, they could be bought for thirty-six dollars a dozen.  Some ofthese were purchased for the army, and answered a most useful purpose.The horses were generally very strong, formed much like the Normanhorse, and with very heavy manes and tails.  A number of officerssupplied themselves with these, and they generally rendered as usefulservice as the northern animal in fact they were much better whengrazing was the only means of supplying forage.There was no need for haste, and some months were consumed in thenecessary preparations for a move.  In the meantime the army was engagedin all the duties pertaining to the officer and the soldier.  Twice,that I remember, small trains were sent from Corpus Christi, withcavalry escorts, to San Antonio and Austin, with paymasters and funds topay off small detachments of troops stationed at those places.  GeneralTaylor encouraged officers to accompany these expeditions.  Iaccompanied one of them in December, 1845.  The distance from CorpusChristi to San Antonio was then computed at one hundred and fifty miles.Now that roads exist it is probably less.  From San Antonio to Austin wecomputed the distance at one hundred and ten miles, and from the latterplace back to Corpus Christi at over two hundred miles.  I know thedistance now from San Antonio to Austin is but little over eighty miles,so that our computation was probably too high.There was not at the time an individual living between Corpus Christiand San Antonio until within about thirty miles of the latter point,where there were a few scattering Mexican settlements along the SanAntonio River.  The people in at least one of these hamlets livedunderground for protection against the Indians.  The country abounded ingame, such as deer and antelope, with abundance of wild turkeys alongthe streams and where there were nut-bearing woods.  On the Nueces,about twenty-five miles up from Corpus Christi, were a few log cabins,the remains of a town called San Patricio, but the inhabitants had allbeen massacred by the Indians, or driven away.San Antonio was about equally divided in population between Americansand Mexicans.  From there to Austin there was not a single residenceexcept at New Braunfels, on the Guadalupe River.  At that point was asettlement of Germans who had only that year come into the State.  Atall events they were living in small huts, about such as soldiers wouldhastily construct for temporary occupation.  From Austin to CorpusChristi there was only a small settlement at Bastrop, with a few farmsalong the Colorado River; but after leaving that, there were nosettlements except the home of one man, with one female slave, at theold town of Goliad.  Some of the houses were still standing.  Goliad hadbeen quite a village for the period and region, but some years beforethere had been a Mexican massacre, in which every inhabitant had beenkilled or driven away.  This, with the massacre of the prisoners in theAlamo, San Antonio, about the same time, more than three hundred men inall, furnished the strongest justification the Texans had for carryingon the war with so much cruelty.  In fact, from that time until theMexican war, the hostilities between Texans and Mexicans was so greatthat neither was safe in the neighborhood of the other who might be insuperior numbers or possessed of superior arms.  The man we found livingthere seemed like an old friend; he had come from near Fort Jessup,Louisiana, where the officers of the 3d and 4th infantry and the 2ddragoons had known him and his family.  He had emigrated in advance ofhis family to build up a home for them.
ISFP	 XXXIII.ATTACK ON GRAND GULF--OPERATIONS BELOW VICKSBURG.On the 24th my headquarters were with the advance at Perkins'plantation.  Reconnoissances were made in boats to ascertain whetherthere was high land on the east shore of the river where we might landabove Grand Gulf.  There was none practicable. Accordingly the troopswere set in motion for Hard Times, twenty-two miles farther down theriver and nearly opposite Grand Gulf.  The loss of two steamers and sixbarges reduced our transportation so that only 10,000 men could be movedby water. Some of the steamers that had got below were injured in theirmachinery, so that they were only useful as barges towed by those lessseverely injured.  All the troops, therefore, except what could betransported in one trip, had to march.  The road lay west of Lake St.Joseph.  Three large bayous had to be crossed.  They were rapidlybridged in the same manner as those previously encountered. (*12)On the 27th McClernand's corps was all at Hard Times, and McPherson'swas following closely.  I had determined to make the attempt to effect alanding on the east side of the river as soon as possible.  Accordingly,on the morning of the 29th, McClernand was directed to embark all thetroops from his corps that our transports and barges could carry.  About10,000 men were so embarked.  The plan was to have the navy silence theguns at Grand Gulf, and to have as many men as possible ready to debarkin the shortest possible time under cover of the fire of the navy andcarry the works by storm.  The following order was issued:PERKINS PLANTATION, LA., April 27,1863.MAJOR-GENERAL J. A. MCCLERNAND, Commanding 13th A. C.Commence immediately the embarkation of your corps, or so much of it asthere is transportation for.  Have put aboard the artillery and everyarticle authorized in orders limiting baggage, except the men, and holdthem in readiness, with their places assigned, to be moved at a moment'swarning.All the troops you may have, except those ordered to remain behind, sendto a point nearly opposite Grand Gulf, where you see, by special ordersof this date, General McPherson is ordered to send one division.The plan of the attack will be for the navy to attack and silence allthe batteries commanding the river.  Your corps will be on the river,ready to run to and debark on the nearest eligible land below thepromontory first brought to view passing down the river.  Once on shore,have each commander instructed beforehand to form his men the best theground will admit of, and take possession of the most commanding points,but avoid separating your command so that it cannot support itself.  Thefirst object is to get a foothold where our troops can maintainthemselves until such time as preparations can be made and troopscollected for a forward movement.Admiral Porter has proposed to place his boats in the position indicatedto you a few days ago, and to bring over with them such troops as may bebelow the city after the guns of the enemy are silenced.It may be that the enemy will occupy positions back from the city, outof range of the gunboats, so as to make it desirable to run past GrandGulf and land at Rodney.  In case this should prove the plan, a signalwill be arranged and you duly informed, when the transports are to startwith this view.  Or, it may be expedient for the boats to run past, butnot the men.  In this case, then, the transports would have to bebrought back to where the men could land and move by forced marches tobelow Grand Gulf, re-embark rapidly and proceed to the latter place.There will be required, then, three signals; one, to indicate that thetransports can run down and debark the troops at Grand Gulf; one, thatthe transports can run by without the troops; and the last, that thetransports can run by with the troops on board.Should the men have to march, all baggage and artillery will be left torun the blockade.If not already directed, require your men to keep three days' rations intheir haversacks, not to be touched until a movement commences.U. S. GRANT, Major-General.At 8 o'clock A.M., 29th, Porter made the attack with his entire strengthpresent, eight gunboats.  For nearly five and a half hours the attackwas kept up without silencing a single gun of the enemy.  All this timeMcClernand's 10,000 men were huddled together on the transports in thestream ready to attempt a landing if signalled.  I occupied a tug fromwhich I could see the effect of the battle on both sides, within rangeof the enemy's guns; but a small tug, without armament, was notcalculated to attract the fire of batteries while they were beingassailed themselves.  About half-past one the fleet withdrew, seeingtheir efforts were entirely unavailing.  The enemy ceased firing as soonas we withdrew.  I immediately signalled the Admiral and went aboard hisship.  The navy lost in this engagement eighteen killed and fifty-sixwounded.  A large proportion of these were of the crew of the flagship,and most of those from a single shell which penetrated the ship's sideand exploded between decks where the men were working their guns.  Thesight of the mangled and dying men which met my eye as I boarded theship was sickening.Grand Gulf is on a high bluff where the river runs at the very foot ofit.  It is as defensible upon its front as Vicksburg and, at that time,would have been just as impossible to capture by a front attack.  Itherefore requested Porter to run the batteries with his fleet thatnight, and to take charge of the transports, all of which would bewanted below.There is a long tongue of land from the Louisiana side extending towardsGrand Gulf, made by the river running nearly east from about three milesabove and nearly in the opposite direction from that point for about thesame distance below.  The land was so low and wet that it would not havebeen practicable to march an army across but for a levee.  I had hadthis explored before, as well as the east bank below to ascertain ifthere was a possible point of debarkation north of Rodney.  It was foundthat the top of the levee afforded a good road to march upon.Porter, as was always the case with him, not only acquiesced in theplan, but volunteered to use his entire fleet as transports.  I hadintended to make this request, but he anticipated me.  At dusk, whenconcealed from the view of the enemy at Grand Gulf, McClernand landedhis command on the west bank.  The navy and transports ran the batteriessuccessfully. The troops marched across the point of land under cover ofnight, unobserved.  By the time it was light the enemy saw our wholefleet, ironclads, gunboats, river steamers and barges, quietly movingdown the river three miles below them, black, or rather blue, withNational troops.When the troops debarked, the evening of the 29th, it was expected thatwe would have to go to Rodney, about nine miles below, to find alanding; but that night a colored man came in who informed me that agood landing would be found at Bruinsburg, a few miles above Rodney,from which point there was a good road leading to Port Gibson sometwelve miles in the interior.  The information was found correct, andour landing was effected without opposition.Sherman had not left his position above Vicksburg yet.  On the morningof the 27th I ordered him to create a diversion by moving his corps upthe Yazoo and threatening an attack on Haines' Bluff.My object was to compel Pemberton to keep as much force about Vicksburgas I could, until I could secure a good footing on high land east of theriver.  The move was eminently successful and, as we afterwards learned,created great confusion about Vicksburg and doubts about our realdesign.  Sherman moved the day of our attack on Grand Gulf, the 29th,with ten regiments of his command and eight gunboats which Porter hadleft above Vicksburg.He debarked his troops and apparently made every preparation to attackthe enemy while the navy bombarded the main forts at Haines' Bluff.This move was made without a single casualty in either branch of theservice.  On the first of May Sherman received orders from me (sent fromHard Times the evening of the 29th of April) to withdraw from the frontof Haines' Bluff and follow McPherson with two divisions as fast as hecould.I had established a depot of supplies at Perkins' plantation. Now thatall our gunboats were below Grand Gulf it was possible that the enemymight fit out boats in the Big Black with improvised armament andattempt to destroy these supplies. McPherson was at Hard Times with aportion of his corps, and the depot was protected by a part of hiscommand.  The night of the 29th I directed him to arm one of thetransports with artillery and send it up to Perkins' plantation as aguard; and also to have the siege guns we had brought along moved thereand put in position.The embarkation below Grand Gulf took place at De Shroon's, Louisiana,six miles above Bruinsburg, Mississippi.  Early on the morning of 30thof April McClernand's corps and one division of McPherson's corps werespeedily landed.When this was effected I felt a degree of relief scarcely ever equalledsince.  Vicksburg was not yet taken it is true, nor were its defendersdemoralized by any of our previous moves.  I was now in the enemy'scountry, with a vast river and the stronghold of Vicksburg between meand my base of supplies.  But I was on dry ground on the same side ofthe river with the enemy.  All the campaigns, labors, hardships andexposures from the month of December previous to this time that had beenmade and endured, were for the accomplishment of this one object.I had with me the 13th corps, General McClernand commanding, and twobrigades of Logan's division of the 17th corps, General McPhersoncommanding--in all not more than twenty thousand men to commence thecampaign with.  These were soon reinforced by the remaining brigade ofLogan's division and Crocker's division of the 17th corps.  On the 7thof May I was further reinforced by Sherman with two divisions of his,the 15th corps.  My total force was then about thirty-three thousandmen.The enemy occupied Grand Gulf, Haines' Bluff and Jackson with a force ofnearly sixty thousand men.  Jackson is fifty miles east of Vicksburg andis connected with it by a railroad.  My first problem was to captureGrand Gulf to use as a base.Bruinsburg is two miles from high ground.  The bottom at that point ishigher than most of the low land in the valley of the Mississippi, and agood road leads to the bluff.  It was natural to expect the garrisonfrom Grand Gulf to come out to meet us and prevent, if they could, ourreaching this solid base.  Bayou Pierre enters the Mississippi justabove Bruinsburg and, as it is a navigable stream and was high at thetime, in order to intercept us they had to go by Port Gibson, thenearest point where there was a bridge to cross upon.  This more thandoubled the distance from Grand Gulf to the high land back ofBruinsburg.  No time was to be lost in securing this foothold. Ourtransportation was not sufficient to move all the army across the riverat one trip, or even two; but the landing of the 13th corps and onedivision of the 17th was effected during the day, April 30th, and earlyevening.  McClernand was advanced as soon as ammunition and two days'rations (to last five) could be issued to his men.  The bluffs werereached an hour before sunset and McClernand was pushed on, hoping toreach Port Gibson and save the bridge spanning the Bayou Pierre beforethe enemy could get there; for crossing a stream in the presence of anenemy is always difficult.  Port Gibson, too, is the starting point ofroads to Grand Gulf, Vicksburg and Jackson.McClernand's advance met the enemy about five miles west of Port Gibsonat Thompson's plantation.  There was some firing during the night, butnothing rising to the dignity of a battle until daylight.  The enemy hadtaken a strong natural position with most of the Grand Gulf garrison,numbering about seven or eight thousand men, under General Bowen.  Hishope was to hold me in check until reinforcements under Loring couldreach him from Vicksburg; but Loring did not come in time to render muchassistance south of Port Gibson.  Two brigades of McPherson's corpsfollowed McClernand as fast as rations and ammunition could be issued,and were ready to take position upon the battlefield whenever the 13thcorps could be got out of the way.The country in this part of Mississippi stands on edge, as it were, theroads running along the ridges except when they occasionally pass fromone ridge to another.  Where there are no clearings the sides of thehills are covered with a very heavy growth of timber and withundergrowth, and the ravines are filled with vines and canebrakes,almost impenetrable.  This makes it easy for an inferior force to delay,if not defeat, a far superior one.Near the point selected by Bowen to defend, the road to Port Gibsondivides, taking two ridges which do not diverge more than a mile or twoat the widest point.  These roads unite just outside the town.  Thismade it necessary for McClernand to divide his force.  It was not onlydivided, but it was separated by a deep ravine of the character abovedescribed.  One flank could not reinforce the other except by marchingback to the junction of the roads.  McClernand put the divisions ofHovey, Carr and A. J. Smith upon the right-hand branch and Osterhaus onthe left.  I was on the field by ten A.M., and inspected both flanks inperson.  On the right the enemy, if not being pressed back, was at leastnot repulsing our advance.  On the left, however, Osterhaus was notfaring so well.  He had been repulsed with some loss.  As soon as theroad could be cleared of McClernand's troops I ordered up McPherson, whowas close upon the rear of the 13th corps, with two brigades of Logan'sdivision.  This was about noon.  I ordered him to send one brigade(General John E. Smith's was selected) to support Osterhaus, and to moveto the left and flank the enemy out of his position.  This movementcarried the brigade over a deep ravine to a third ridge and, whenSmith's troops were seen well through the ravine, Osterhaus was directedto renew his front attack.  It was successful and unattended by heavyloss.  The enemy was sent in full retreat on their right, and their leftfollowed before sunset.  While the movement to our left was going on,McClernand, who was with his right flank, sent me frequent requests forreinforcements, although the force with him was not being pressed.  Ihad been upon the ground and knew it did not admit of his engaging allthe men he had.  We followed up our victory until night overtook usabout two miles from Port Gibson; then the troops went into bivouac forthe night.
ISFP	 XXXIV.CAPTURE OF PORT GIBSON--GRIERSON'S RAID--OCCUPATION OF GRAND GULF--MOVEMENT UP THE BIG BLACK--BATTLE OF RAYMOND.We started next morning for Port Gibson as soon as it was light enoughto see the road.  We were soon in the town, and I was delighted to findthat the enemy had not stopped to contest our crossing further at thebridge, which he had burned.  The troops were set to work at once toconstruct a bridge across the South Fork of the Bayou Pierre.  At thistime the water was high and the current rapid.  What might be called araft-bridge was soon constructed from material obtained from woodenbuildings, stables, fences, etc., which sufficed for carrying the wholearmy over safely.  Colonel J. H. Wilson, a member of my staff, plannedand superintended the construction of this bridge, going into the waterand working as hard as any one engaged.  Officers and men generallyjoined in this work.  When it was finished the army crossed and marchedeight miles beyond to the North Fork that day.  One brigade of Logan'sdivision was sent down the stream to occupy the attention of a rebelbattery, which had been left behind with infantry supports to preventour repairing the burnt railroad bridge.  Two of his brigades were sentup the bayou to find a crossing and reach the North Fork to repair thebridge there.  The enemy soon left when he found we were building abridge elsewhere.  Before leaving Port Gibson we were reinforced byCrocker's division, McPherson's corps, which had crossed the Mississippiat Bruinsburg and come up without stopping except to get two days'rations.  McPherson still had one division west of the MississippiRiver, guarding the road from Milliken's Bend to the river below untilSherman's command should relieve it.On leaving Bruinsburg for the front I left my son Frederick, who hadjoined me a few weeks before, on board one of the gunboats asleep, andhoped to get away without him until after Grand Gulf should fall intoour hands; but on waking up he learned that I had gone, and being guidedby the sound of the battle raging at Thompson's Hill--called the Battleof Port Gibson--found his way to where I was.  He had no horse to rideat the time, and I had no facilities for even preparing a meal.  He,therefore, foraged around the best he could until we reached Grand Gulf.Mr. C. A. Dana, then an officer of the War Department, accompanied me onthe Vicksburg campaign and through a portion of the siege.  He was inthe same situation as Fred so far as transportation and messarrangements were concerned.  The first time I call to mind seeingeither of them, after the battle, they were mounted on two enormoushorses, grown white from age, each equipped with dilapidated saddles andbridles.Our trains arrived a few days later, after which we were all perfectlyequipped.My son accompanied me throughout the campaign and siege, and caused noanxiety either to me or to his mother, who was at home.  He looked outfor himself and was in every battle of the campaign.  His age, then notquite thirteen, enabled him to take in all he saw, and to retain arecollection of it that would not be possible in more mature years.When the movement from Bruinsburg commenced we were without a wagontrain.  The train still west of the Mississippi was carried around withproper escort, by a circuitous route from Milliken's Bend to Hard Timesseventy or more miles below, and did not get up for some days after thebattle of Port Gibson. My own horses, headquarters' transportation,servants, mess chest, and everything except what I had on, was with thistrain. General A. J. Smith happened to have an extra horse at Bruinsburgwhich I borrowed, with a saddle-tree without upholstering further thanstirrups.  I had no other for nearly a week.It was necessary to have transportation for ammunition. Provisions couldbe taken from the country; but all the ammunition that can be carried onthe person is soon exhausted when there is much fighting.  I directed,therefore, immediately on landing that all the vehicles and draftanimals, whether horses, mules, or oxen, in the vicinity should becollected and loaded to their capacity with ammunition.  Quite a trainwas collected during the 30th, and a motley train it was.  In it couldbe found fine carriages, loaded nearly to the top with boxes ofcartridges that had been pitched in promiscuously, drawn by mules withplough, harness, straw collars, rope-lines, etc.; long-coupled wagons,with racks for carrying cotton bales, drawn by oxen, and everything thatcould be found in the way of transportation on a plantation, either foruse or pleasure.  The making out of provision returns was stopped forthe time.  No formalities were to retard our progress until a positionwas secured when the time could be spared to observe them.It was at Port Gibson I first heard through a Southern paper of thecomplete success of Colonel Grierson, who was making a raid throughcentral Mississippi.  He had started from La Grange April 17th withthree regiments of about 1,700 men.  On the 21st he had detached ColonelHatch with one regiment to destroy the railroad between Columbus andMacon and then return to La Grange.  Hatch had a sharp fight with theenemy at Columbus and retreated along the railroad, destroying it atOkalona and Tupelo, and arriving in La Grange April 26.  Griersoncontinued his movement with about 1,000 men, breaking the Vicksburg andMeridian railroad and the New Orleans and Jackson railroad, arriving atBaton Rouge May 2d.  This raid was of great importance, for Grierson hadattracted the attention of the enemy from the main movement againstVicksburg.During the night of the 2d of May the bridge over the North Fork wasrepaired, and the troops commenced crossing at five the next morning.Before the leading brigade was over it was fired upon by the enemy froma commanding position; but they were soon driven off.  It was evidentthat the enemy was covering a retreat from Grand Gulf to Vicksburg.Every commanding position from this (Grindstone) crossing to Hankinson'sferry over the Big Black was occupied by the retreating foe to delay ourprogress. McPherson, however, reached Hankinson's ferry before night,seized the ferry boat, and sent a detachment of his command across andseveral miles north on the road to Vicksburg.  When the junction of theroad going to Vicksburg with the road from Grand Gulf to Raymond andJackson was reached, Logan with his division was turned to the lefttowards Grand Gulf.  I went with him a short distance from thisjunction.  McPherson had encountered the largest force yet met since thebattle of Port Gibson and had a skirmish nearly approaching a battle;but the road Logan had taken enabled him to come up on the enemy's rightflank, and they soon gave way.  McPherson was ordered to holdHankinson's ferry and the road back to Willow Springs with one division;McClernand, who was now in the rear, was to join in this as well as toguard the line back down the bayou.  I did not want to take the chancesof having an enemy lurking in our rear.On the way from the junction to Grand Gulf, where the road comes intothe one from Vicksburg to the same place six or seven miles out, Ilearned that the last of the enemy had retreated past that place ontheir way to Vicksburg.  I left Logan to make the proper disposition ofhis troops for the night, while I rode into the town with an escort ofabout twenty cavalry.  Admiral Porter had already arrived with hisfleet.  The enemy had abandoned his heavy guns and evacuated the place.When I reached Grand Gulf May 3d I had not been with my baggage sincethe 27th of April and consequently had had no change of underclothing,no meal except such as I could pick up sometimes at other headquarters,and no tent to cover me.  The first thing I did was to get a bath,borrow some fresh underclothing from one of the naval officers andget a good meal on the flag-ship.  Then I wrote letters to thegeneral-in-chief informing him of our present position, dispatches to betelegraphed from Cairo, orders to General Sullivan commanding aboveVicksburg, and gave orders to all my corps commanders.  About twelveo'clock at night I was through my work and started for Hankinson'sferry, arriving there before daylight.  While at Grand Gulf I heard fromBanks, who was on the Red River, and who said that he could not be atPort Hudson before the 10th of May and then with only 15,000 men.  Up tothis time my intention had been to secure Grand Gulf, as a base ofsupplies, detach McClernand's corps to Banks and co-operate with him inthe reduction of Port Hudson.The news from Banks forced upon me a different plan of campaign from theone intended.  To wait for his co-operation would have detained me atleast a month.  The reinforcements would not have reached ten thousandmen after deducting casualties and necessary river guards at all highpoints close to the river for over three hundred miles.  The enemy wouldhave strengthened his position and been reinforced by more men thanBanks could have brought. I therefore determined to move independentlyof Banks, cut loose from my base, destroy the rebel force in rear ofVicksburg and invest or capture the city.Grand Gulf was accordingly given up as a base and the authorities atWashington were notified.  I knew well that Halleck's caution would leadhim to disapprove of this course; but it was the only one that gave anychance of success.  The time it would take to communicate withWashington and get a reply would be so great that I could not beinterfered with until it was demonstrated whether my plan waspracticable.  Even Sherman, who afterwards ignored bases of suppliesother than what were afforded by the country while marching through fourStates of the Confederacy with an army more than twice as large as mineat this time, wrote me from Hankinson's ferry, advising me of theimpossibility of supplying our army over a single road.  He urged me to'stop all troops till your army is partially supplied with wagons, andthen act as quick as possible; for this road will be jammed, as sure aslife.'  To this I replied:  'I do not calculate upon the possibility ofsupplying the army with full rations from Grand Gulf.  I know it will beimpossible without constructing additional roads.  What I do expect isto get up what rations of hard bread, coffee and salt we can, and makethe country furnish the balance.'  We started from Bruinsburg with anaverage of about two days' rations, and received no more from our ownsupplies for some days; abundance was found in the mean time.  A delaywould give the enemy time to reinforce and fortify.McClernand's and McPherson's commands were kept substantially as theywere on the night of the 2d, awaiting supplies sufficient to give themthree days' rations in haversacks.  Beef, mutton, poultry and foragewere found in abundance.  Quite a quantity of bacon and molasses wasalso secured from the country, but bread and coffee could not beobtained in quantity sufficient for all the men.  Every plantation,however, had a run of stone, propelled by mule power, to grind corn forthe owners and their slaves.  All these were kept running while we werestopping, day and night, and when we were marching, during the night, atall plantations covered by the troops.  But the product was taken by thetroops nearest by, so that the majority of the command was destined togo without bread until a new base was established on the Yazoo aboveVicksburg.While the troops were awaiting the arrival of rations I orderedreconnoissances made by McClernand and McPherson, with the view ofleading the enemy to believe that we intended to cross the Big Black andattack the city at once.On the 6th Sherman arrived at Grand Gulf and crossed his command thatnight and the next day.  Three days' rations had been brought up fromGrand Gulf for the advanced troops and were issued.  Orders were givenfor a forward movement the next day.  Sherman was directed to order upBlair, who had been left behind to guard the road from Milliken's Bendto Hard Times with two brigades.The quartermaster at Young's Point was ordered to send two hundredwagons with Blair, and the commissary was to load them with hard bread,coffee, sugar, salt and one hundred thousand pounds of salt meat.On the 3d Hurlbut, who had been left at Memphis, was ordered to sendfour regiments from his command to Milliken's Bend to relieve Blair'sdivision, and on the 5th he was ordered to send Lauman's division inaddition, the latter to join the army in the field.  The four regimentswere to be taken from troops near the river so that there would be nodelay.During the night of the 6th McPherson drew in his troops north of theBig Black and was off at an early hour on the road to Jackson, via RockySprings, Utica and Raymond.  That night he and McClernand were both atRocky Springs ten miles from Hankinson's ferry.  McPherson remainedthere during the 8th, while McClernand moved to Big Sandy and Shermanmarched from Grand Gulf to Hankinson's ferry.  The 9th, McPherson movedto a point within a few miles west of Utica; McClernand and Shermanremained where they were.  On the 10th McPherson moved to Utica, Shermanto Big Sandy; McClernand was still at Big Sandy.  The 11th, McClernandwas at Five Mile Creek; Sherman at Auburn; McPherson five miles advancedfrom Utica. May 12th, McClernand was at Fourteen Mile Creek; Sherman atFourteen Mile Creek; McPherson at Raymond after a battle.After McPherson crossed the Big Black at Hankinson's ferry Vicksburgcould have been approached and besieged by the south side.  It is notprobable, however, that Pemberton would have permitted a closebesiegement.  The broken nature of the ground would have enabled him tohold a strong defensible line from the river south of the city to theBig Black, retaining possession of the railroad back to that point.  Itwas my plan, therefore, to get to the railroad east of Vicksburg, andapproach from that direction.  Accordingly, McPherson's troops that hadcrossed the Big Black were withdrawn and the movement east to Jacksoncommenced.As has been stated before, the country is very much broken and the roadsgenerally confined to the tops of the hills.  The troops were moved one(sometimes two) corps at a time to reach designated points out parallelto the railroad and only from six to ten miles from it.  McClernand'scorps was kept with its left flank on the Big Black guarding all thecrossings.  Fourteen Mile Creek, a stream substantially parallel withthe railroad, was reached and crossings effected by McClernand andSherman with slight loss.  McPherson was to the right of Sherman,extending to Raymond.  The cavalry was used in this advance inreconnoitring to find the roads:  to cover our advances and to find themost practicable routes from one command to another so they couldsupport each other in case of an attack.  In making this move Iestimated Pemberton's movable force at Vicksburg at about eighteenthousand men, with smaller forces at Haines' Bluff and Jackson.  Itwould not be possible for Pemberton to attack me with all his troops atone place, and I determined to throw my army between his and fight himin detail.  This was done with success, but I found afterwards that Ihad entirely under-estimated Pemberton's strength.Up to this point our movements had been made without serious opposition.My line was now nearly parallel with the Jackson and Vicksburg railroadand about seven miles south of it.  The right was at Raymond eighteenmiles from Jackson, McPherson commanding; Sherman in the centre onFourteen Mile Creek, his advance thrown across; McClernand to the left,also on Fourteen Mile Creek, advance across, and his pickets within twomiles of Edward's station, where the enemy had concentrated aconsiderable force and where they undoubtedly expected us to attack.McClernand's left was on the Big Black.  In all our moves, up to thistime, the left had hugged the Big Black closely, and all the ferries hadbeen guarded to prevent the enemy throwing a force on our rear.McPherson encountered the enemy, five thousand strong with two batteriesunder General Gregg, about two miles out of Raymond. This was about twoP.M.  Logan was in advance with one of his brigades.  He deployed andmoved up to engage the enemy. McPherson ordered the road in rear to becleared of wagons, and the balance of Logan's division, and Crocker's,which was still farther in rear, to come forward with all dispatch.  Theorder was obeyed with alacrity.  Logan got his division in position forassault before Crocker could get up, and attacked with vigor, carryingthe enemy's position easily, sending Gregg flying from the field not toappear against our front again until we met at Jackson.In this battle McPherson lost 66 killed, 339 wounded, and 37 missing--nearly or quite all from Logan's division.  The enemy's loss was 100killed, 305 wounded, besides 415 taken prisoners.I regarded Logan and Crocker as being as competent division commandersas could be found in or out of the army and both equal to a much highercommand.  Crocker, however, was dying of consumption when hevolunteered.  His weak condition never put him on the sick report whenthere was a battle in prospect, as long as he could keep on his feet.He died not long after the close of the rebellion.
ISFP	 XXXV.MOVEMENT AGAINST JACKSON--FALL OF JACKSON--INTERCEPTING THE ENEMY--BATTLE OF CHAMPION'S HILL.When the news reached me of McPherson's victory at Raymond about sundownmy position was with Sherman.  I decided at once to turn the wholecolumn towards Jackson and capture that place without delay.Pemberton was now on my left, with, as I supposed, about 18,000 men; infact, as I learned afterwards, with nearly 50,000.  A force was alsocollecting on my right, at Jackson, the point where all the railroadscommunicating with Vicksburg connect. All the enemy's supplies of menand stores would come by that point.  As I hoped in the end to besiegeVicksburg I must first destroy all possibility of aid.  I thereforedetermined to move swiftly towards Jackson, destroy or drive any forcein that direction and then turn upon Pemberton.  But by moving againstJackson, I uncovered my own communication.  So I finally decided to havenone--to cut loose altogether from my base and move my whole forceeastward.  I then had no fears for my communications, and if I movedquickly enough could turn upon Pemberton before he could attack me inthe rear.Accordingly, all previous orders given during the day for movements onthe 13th were annulled by new ones.  McPherson was ordered at daylightto move on Clinton, ten miles from Jackson; Sherman was notified of mydetermination to capture Jackson and work from there westward.  He wasordered to start at four in the morning and march to Raymond.McClernand was ordered to march with three divisions by Dillon's toRaymond.  One was left to guard the crossing of the Big Black.On the 10th I had received a letter from Banks, on the Red River, askingreinforcements.  Porter had gone to his assistance with a part of hisfleet on the 3d, and I now wrote to him describing my position anddeclining to send any troops.  I looked upon side movements as long asthe enemy held Port Hudson and Vicksburg as a waste of time andmaterial.General Joseph E. Johnston arrived at Jackson in the night of the 13thfrom Tennessee, and immediately assumed command of all the Confederatetroops in Mississippi.  I knew he was expecting reinforcements from thesouth and east. On the 6th I had written to General Halleck:'Information from the other side leaves me to believe the enemy arebringing forces from Tullahoma.'Up to this time my troops had been kept in supporting distances of eachother, as far as the nature of the country would admit.  Reconnoissanceswere constantly made from each corps to enable them to acquaintthemselves with the most practicable routes from one to another in casea union became necessary.McPherson reached Clinton with the advance early on the 13th andimmediately set to work destroying the railroad.  Sherman's advancereached Raymond before the last of McPherson's command had got out ofthe town.  McClernand withdrew from the front of the enemy, at Edward'sstation, with much skill and without loss, and reached his position forthe night in good order.  On the night of the 13th, McPherson wasordered to march at early dawn upon Jackson, only fifteen miles away.Sherman was given the same order; but he was to move by the direct roadfrom Raymond to Jackson, which is south of the road McPherson was on anddoes not approach within two miles of it at the point where it crossedthe line of intrenchments which, at that time, defended the city.McClernand was ordered to move one division of his command to Clinton,one division a few miles beyond Mississippi Springs following Sherman'sline, and a third to Raymond.  He was also directed to send his siegeguns, four in number with the troops going by Mississippi Springs.McClernand's position was an advantageous one in any event. With onedivision at Clinton he was in position to reinforce McPherson, atJackson, rapidly if it became necessary; the division beyond MississippiSprings was equally available to reinforce Sherman; the one at Raymondcould take either road. He still had two other divisions farther backnow that Blair had come up, available within a day at Jackson.  If thislast command should not be wanted at Jackson, they were already oneday's march from there on their way to Vicksburg and on three differentroads leading to the latter city.  But the most important considerationin my mind was to have a force confronting Pemberton if he should comeout to attack my rear. This I expected him to do; as shown further on,he was directed by Johnston to make this very move.I notified General Halleck that I should attack the State capital on the14th.  A courier carried the dispatch to Grand Gulf through anunprotected country.Sherman and McPherson communicated with each other during the night andarranged to reach Jackson at about the same hour.  It rained in torrentsduring the night of the 13th and the fore part of the day of the 14th.The roads were intolerable, and in some places on Sherman's line, wherethe land was low, they were covered more than a foot deep with water.But the troops never murmured.  By nine o'clock Crocker, of McPherson'scorps, who was now in advance, came upon the enemy's pickets andspeedily drove them in upon the main body.  They were outside of theintrenchments in a strong position, and proved to be the troops that hadbeen driven out of Raymond.  Johnston had been reinforced; during thenight by Georgia and South Carolina regiments, so that his forceamounted to eleven thousand men, and he was expecting still more.Sherman also came upon the rebel pickets some distance out from thetown, but speedily drove them in.  He was now on the south andsouth-west of Jackson confronting the Confederates behind theirbreastworks, while McPherson's right was nearly two miles north,occupying a line running north and south across the Vicksburg railroad.Artillery was brought up and reconnoissances made preparatory to anassault. McPherson brought up Logan's division while he deployedCrocker's for the assault.  Sherman made similar dispositions on theright.  By eleven A.M. both were ready to attack.  Crocker moved hisdivision forward, preceded by a strong skirmish line.  These troops atonce encountered the enemy's advance and drove it back on the main body,when they returned to their proper regiment and the whole divisioncharged, routing the enemy completely and driving him into this mainline.  This stand by the enemy was made more than two miles outside ofhis main fortifications. McPherson followed up with his command untilwithin range of the guns of the enemy from their intrenchments, when hehalted to bring his troops into line and reconnoitre to determine thenext move.  It was now about noon.While this was going on Sherman was confronting a rebel battery whichenfiladed the road on which he was marching--the Mississippi Springsroad--and commanded a bridge spanning a stream over which he had topass.  By detaching right and left the stream was forced and the enemyflanked and speedily driven within the main line.  This brought ourwhole line in front of the enemy's line of works, which was continuouson the north, west and south sides from the Pearl River north of thecity to the same river south.  I was with Sherman.  He was confronted bya force sufficient to hold us back.  Appearances did not justify anassault where we were.  I had directed Sherman to send a force to theright, and to reconnoitre as far as to the Pearl River.  This force,Tuttle's division, not returning I rode to the right with my staff, andsoon found that the enemy had left that part of the line.  Tuttle'smovement or McPherson's pressure had no doubt led Johnston to order aretreat, leaving only the men at the guns to retard us while he wasgetting away.  Tuttle had seen this and, passing through the lineswithout resistance, came up in the rear of the artillerists confrontingSherman and captured them with ten pieces of artillery.  I rodeimmediately to the State House, where I was soon followed by Sherman.About the same time McPherson discovered that the enemy was leaving hisfront, and advanced Crocker, who was so close upon the enemy that theycould not move their guns or destroy them.  He captured seven guns and,moving on, hoisted the National flag over the rebel capital ofMississippi.  Stevenson's brigade was sent to cut off the rebel retreat,but was too late or not expeditious enough.Our loss in this engagement was:  McPherson, 37 killed, 228 wounded;Sherman, 4 killed and 21 wounded and missing.  The enemy lost 845killed, wounded and captured.  Seventeen guns fell into our hands, andthe enemy destroyed by fire their store-houses, containing a largeamount of commissary stores.On this day Blair reached New Auburn and joined McClernand's 4thdivision.  He had with him two hundred wagons loaded with rations, theonly commissary supplies received during the entire campaign.I slept that night in the room that Johnston was said to have occupiedthe night before.About four in the afternoon I sent for the corps commanders and directedthe dispositions to be made of their troops.  Sherman was to remain inJackson until he destroyed that place as a railroad centre, andmanufacturing city of military supplies. He did the work mosteffectually.  Sherman and I went together into a manufactory which hadnot ceased work on account of the battle nor for the entrance of Yankeetroops.  Our presence did not seem to attract the attention of eitherthe manager or the operatives, most of whom were girls.  We looked onfor a while to see the tent cloth which they were making roll out of thelooms, with 'C. S. A.'  woven in each bolt.  There was an immense amountof cotton, in bales, stacked outside.  Finally I told Sherman I thoughtthey had done work enough.  The operatives were told they could leaveand take with them what cloth they could carry.  In a few minutes cottonand factory were in a blaze. The proprietor visited Washington while Iwas President to get his pay for this property, claiming that it wasprivate.  He asked me to give him a statement of the fact that hisproperty had been destroyed by National troops, so that he might use itwith Congress where he was pressing, or proposed to press, his claim.  Ideclined.On the night of the 13th Johnston sent the following dispatch toPemberton at Edward's station:  'I have lately arrived, and learn thatMajor-General Sherman is between us with four divisions at Clinton.  Itis important to establish communication, that you may be reinforced.  Ifpracticable, come up in his rear at once.  To beat such a detachmentwould be of immense value.  All the troops you can quickly assembleshould be brought.  Time is all-important.'  This dispatch was sent intriplicate, by different messengers.  One of the messengers happened tobe a loyal man who had been expelled from Memphis some months before byHurlbut for uttering disloyal and threatening sentiments. There was agood deal of parade about his expulsion, ostensibly as a warning tothose who entertained the sentiments he expressed; but Hurlbut and theexpelled man understood each other.  He delivered his copy of Johnston'sdispatch to McPherson who forwarded it to me.Receiving this dispatch on the 14th I ordered McPherson to move promptlyin the morning back to Bolton, the nearest point where Johnston couldreach the road.  Bolton is about twenty miles west of Jackson.  I alsoinformed McClernand of the capture of Jackson and sent him the followingorder:  'It is evidently the design of the enemy to get north of us andcross the Big Black, and beat us into Vicksburg.  We must not allow themto do this.  Turn all your forces towards Bolton station, and make alldispatch in getting there.  Move troops by the most direct road fromwherever they may be on the receipt of this order.'And to Blair I wrote:  'Their design is evidently to cross the Big Blackand pass down the peninsula between the Big Black and Yazoo rivers.  Wemust beat them.  Turn your troops immediately to Bolton; take all thetrains with you.  Smith's division, and any other troops now with you,will go to the same place.  If practicable, take parallel roads, so asto divide your troops and train.'Johnston stopped on the Canton road only six miles north of Jackson, thenight of the 14th.  He sent from there to Pemberton dispatchesannouncing the loss of Jackson, and the following order:'As soon as the reinforcements are all up, they must be united to therest of the army.  I am anxious to see a force assembled that may beable to inflict a heavy blow upon the enemy.  Can Grant supply himselffrom the Mississippi?  Can you not cut him off from it, and above all,should he be compelled to fall back for want of supplies, beat him.'The concentration of my troops was easy, considering the character ofthe country.  McPherson moved along the road parallel with and near therailroad.  McClernand's command was, one division (Hovey's) on the roadMcPherson had to take, but with a start of four miles.  One (Osterhaus)was at Raymond, on a converging road that intersected the other nearChampion's Hill; one (Carr's) had to pass over the same road withOsterhaus, but being back at Mississippi Springs, would not be detainedby it; the fourth (Smith's) with Blair's division, was near Auburn witha different road to pass over.  McClernand faced about and movedpromptly.  His cavalry from Raymond seized Bolton by half-past nine inthe morning, driving out the enemy's pickets and capturing several men.The night of the 15th Hovey was at Bolton; Carr and Osterhaus were aboutthree miles south, but abreast, facing west; Smith was north of Raymondwith Blair in his rear.McPherson's command, with Logan in front, had marched at seven o'clock,and by four reached Hovey and went into camp; Crocker bivouacked just inHovey's rear on the Clinton road.  Sherman with two divisions, was inJackson, completing the destruction of roads, bridges and militaryfactories.  I rode in person out to Clinton.  On my arrival I orderedMcClernand to move early in the morning on Edward's station, cautioninghim to watch for the enemy and not bring on an engagement unless he feltvery certain of success.I naturally expected that Pemberton would endeavor to obey the orders ofhis superior, which I have shown were to attack us at Clinton.  This,indeed, I knew he could not do; but I felt sure he would make theattempt to reach that point.  It turned out, however, that he haddecided his superior's plans were impracticable, and consequentlydetermined to move south from Edward's station and get between me and mybase.  I, however, had no base, having abandoned it more than a weekbefore.  On the 15th Pemberton had actually marched south from Edward'sstation, but the rains had swollen Baker's Creek, which he had to crossso much that he could not ford it, and the bridges were washed away.This brought him back to the Jackson road, on which there was a goodbridge over Baker's Creek.  Some of his troops were marching untilmidnight to get there.  Receiving here early on the 16th a repetition ofhis order to join Johnston at Clinton, he concluded to obey, and sent adispatch to his chief, informing him of the route by which he might beexpected.About five o'clock in the morning (16th) two men, who had been employedon the Jackson and Vicksburg railroad, were brought to me.  Theyreported that they had passed through Pemberton's army in the night, andthat it was still marching east. They reported him to have eightyregiments of infantry and ten batteries; in all, about twenty-fivethousand men.I had expected to leave Sherman at Jackson another day in order tocomplete his work; but getting the above information I sent him ordersto move with all dispatch to Bolton, and to put one division with anammunition train on the road at once, with directions to its commanderto march with all possible speed until he came up to our rear.  Withinan hour after receiving this order Steele's division was on the road.At the same time I dispatched to Blair, who was near Auburn, to movewith all speed to Edward's station.  McClernand was directed to embraceBlair in his command for the present.  Blair's division was a part ofthe 15th army corps (Sherman's); but as it was on its way to join itscorps, it naturally struck our left first, now that we had faced aboutand were moving west. The 15th corps, when it got up, would be on ourextreme right.  McPherson was directed to get his trains out of the wayof the troops, and to follow Hovey's division as closely as possible.McClernand had two roads about three miles apart, converging at Edward'sstation, over which to march his troops.  Hovey's division of his corpshad the advance on a third road (the Clinton) still farther north.McClernand was directed to move Blair's and A. J. Smith's divisions bythe southernmost of these roads, and Osterhaus and Carr by the middleroad.  Orders were to move cautiously with skirmishers to the front tofeel for the enemy.Smith's division on the most southern road was the first to encounterthe enemy's pickets, who were speedily driven in. Osterhaus, on themiddle road, hearing the firing, pushed his skirmishers forward, foundthe enemy's pickets and forced them back to the main line.  About thesame time Hovey encountered the enemy on the northern or direct wagonroad from Jackson to Vicksburg.  McPherson was hastening up to joinHovey, but was embarrassed by Hovey's trains occupying the roads.  I wasstill back at Clinton.  McPherson sent me word of the situation, andexpressed the wish that I was up.  By half-past seven I was on the roadand proceeded rapidly to the front, ordering all trains that were infront of troops off the road.  When I arrived Hovey's skirmishingamounted almost to a battle.McClernand was in person on the middle road and had a shorter distanceto march to reach the enemy's position than McPherson.  I sent him wordby a staff officer to push forward and attack.  These orders wererepeated several times without apparently expediting McClernand'sadvance.Champion's Hill, where Pemberton had chosen his position to receive us,whether taken by accident or design, was well selected.  It is one ofthe highest points in that section, and commanded all the ground inrange.  On the east side of the ridge, which is quite precipitous, is aravine running first north, then westerly, terminating at Baker's Creek.It was grown up thickly with large trees and undergrowth, making itdifficult to penetrate with troops, even when not defended.  The ridgeoccupied by the enemy terminated abruptly where the ravine turnswesterly.  The left of the enemy occupied the north end of this ridge.The Bolton and Edward's station wagon-road turns almost due south atthis point and ascends the ridge, which it follows for about a mile;then turning west, descends by a gentle declivity to Baker's Creek,nearly a mile away.  On the west side the slope of the ridge is gradualand is cultivated from near the summit to the creek.  There was, when wewere there, a narrow belt of timber near the summit west of the road.From Raymond there is a direct road to Edward's station, some threemiles west of Champion's Hill.  There is one also to Bolton.  From thislatter road there is still another, leaving it about three and a halfmiles before reaching Bolton and leads direct to the same station.  Itwas along these two roads that three divisions of McClernand's corps,and Blair of Sherman's, temporarily under McClernand, were moving.Hovey of McClernand's command was with McPherson, farther north on theroad from Bolton direct to Edward's station.  The middle road comes intothe northern road at the point where the latter turns to the west anddescends to Baker's Creek; the southern road is still several milessouth and does not intersect the others until it reaches Edward'sstation.  Pemberton's lines covered all these roads, and faced east.Hovey's line, when it first drove in the enemy's pickets, was formedparallel to that of the enemy and confronted his left.By eleven o'clock the skirmishing had grown into a hard-contestedbattle.  Hovey alone, before other troops could be got to assist him,had captured a battery of the enemy.  But he was not able to hold hisposition and had to abandon the artillery.  McPherson brought up histroops as fast as possible, Logan in front, and posted them on the rightof Hovey and across the flank of the enemy.  Logan reinforced Hovey withone brigade from his division; with his other two he moved farther westto make room for Crocker, who was coming up as rapidly as the roadswould admit.  Hovey was still being heavily pressed, and was calling onme for more reinforcements.  I ordered Crocker, who was now coming up,to send one brigade from his division. McPherson ordered two batteriesto be stationed where they nearly enfiladed the enemy's line, and theydid good execution.From Logan's position now a direct forward movement carried him overopen fields, in rear of the enemy and in a line parallel with them.  Hedid make exactly this move, attacking, however, the enemy through thebelt of woods covering the west slope of the hill for a short distance.Up to this time I had kept my position near Hovey where we were the mostheavily pressed; but about noon I moved with a part of my staff by ourright around, until I came up with Logan himself.  I found him near theroad leading down to Baker's Creek.  He was actually in command of theonly road over which the enemy could retreat; Hovey, reinforced by twobrigades from McPherson's command, confronted the enemy's left; Crocker,with two brigades, covered their left flank; McClernand two hoursbefore, had been within two miles and a half of their centre with twodivisions, and the two divisions, Blair's and A. J. Smith's, wereconfronting the rebel right; Ransom, with a brigade of McArthur'sdivision of the 17th corps (McPherson's), had crossed the river at GrandGulf a few days before, and was coming up on their right flank.  NeitherLogan nor I knew that we had cut off the retreat of the enemy.  Just atthis juncture a messenger came from Hovey, asking for morereinforcements.  There were none to spare.  I then gave an order to moveMcPherson's command by the left flank around to Hovey. This uncoveredthe rebel line of retreat, which was soon taken advantage of by theenemy.During all this time, Hovey, reinforced as he was by a brigade fromLogan and another from Crocker, and by Crocker gallantly coming up withtwo other brigades on his right, had made several assaults, the last oneabout the time the road was opened to the rear.  The enemy fledprecipitately.  This was between three and four o'clock.  I rodeforward, or rather back, to where the middle road intersects the northroad, and found the skirmishers of Carr's division just coming in.Osterhaus was farther south and soon after came up with skirmishersadvanced in like manner.  Hovey's division, and McPherson's twodivisions with him, had marched and fought from early dawn, and were notin the best condition to follow the retreating foe.  I sent orders toOsterhaus to pursue the enemy, and to Carr, whom I saw personally, Iexplained the situation and directed him to pursue vigorously as far asthe Big Black, and to cross it if he could; Osterhaus to follow him.The pursuit was continued until after dark.The battle of Champion's Hill lasted about four hours, hard fighting,preceded by two or three hours of skirmishing, some of which almost roseto the dignity of battle.  Every man of Hovey's division and ofMcPherson's two divisions was engaged during the battle.  No other partof my command was engaged at all, except that as described before.Osterhaus's and A. J. Smith's divisions had encountered the rebeladvanced pickets as early as half-past seven.  Their positions wereadmirable for advancing upon the enemy's line.  McClernand, with twodivisions, was within a few miles of the battle-field long before noonand in easy hearing.  I sent him repeated orders by staff officers fullycompetent to explain to him the situation.  These traversed the woodseparating us, without escort, and directed him to push forward; but hedid not come.  It is true, in front of McClernand there was a smallforce of the enemy and posted in a good position behind a ravineobstructing his advance; but if he had moved to the right by the road mystaff officers had followed the enemy must either have fallen back orbeen cut off.  Instead of this he sent orders to Hovey, who belonged tohis corps, to join on to his right flank.  Hovey was bearing the bruntof the battle at the time.  To obey the order he would have had to pullout from the front of the enemy and march back as far as McClernand hadto advance to get into battle and substantially over the same ground.Of course I did not permit Hovey to obey the order of his intermediatesuperior.We had in this battle about 15,000 men absolutely engaged.  Thisexcludes those that did not get up, all of McClernand's command exceptHovey.  Our loss was 410 killed, 1,844 wounded and 187 missing.  Hoveyalone lost 1,200 killed, wounded and missing--more than one-third of hisdivision.Had McClernand come up with reasonable promptness, or had I known theground as I did afterwards, I cannot see how Pemberton could haveescaped with any organized force.  As it was he lost over three thousandkilled and wounded and about three thousand captured in battle and inpursuit.  Loring's division, which was the right of Pemberton's line,was cut off from the retreating army and never got back into Vicksburg.Pemberton himself fell back that night to the Big Black River.  Histroops did not stop before midnight and many of them left before thegeneral retreat commenced, and no doubt a good part of them returned totheir homes.  Logan alone captured 1,300 prisoners and eleven guns.Hovey captured 300 under fire and about 700 in all, exclusive of 500sick and wounded whom he paroled, thus making 1,200.McPherson joined in the advance as soon as his men could fill theircartridge-boxes, leaving one brigade to guard our wounded.  The pursuitwas continued as long as it was light enough to see the road.  The nightof the 16th of May found McPherson's command bivouacked from two to sixmiles west of the battlefield, along the line of the road to Vicksburg.Carr and Osterhaus were at Edward's station, and Blair was about threemiles south-east; Hovey remained on the field where his troops hadfought so bravely and bled so freely.  Much war material abandoned bythe enemy was picked up on the battle-field, among it thirty pieces ofartillery.  I pushed through the advancing column with my staff and keptin advance until after night. Finding ourselves alone we stopped andtook possession of a vacant house.  As no troops came up we moved back amile or more until we met the head of the column just going into bivouacon the road.  We had no tents, so we occupied the porch of a house whichhad been taken for a rebel hospital and which was filled with woundedand dying who had been brought from the battle-field we had just left.While a battle is raging one can see his enemy mowed down by thethousand, or the ten thousand, with great composure; but after thebattle these scenes are distressing, and one is naturally disposed to doas much to alleviate the suffering of an enemy as a friend.
ISFP	 XXXVI.BATTLE OF BLACK RIVER BRIDGE--CROSSING THE BIG BLACK--INVESTMENT OFVICKSBURG--ASSAULTING THE WORKS.We were now assured of our position between Johnston and Pemberton,without a possibility of a junction of their forces.  Pemberton mighthave made a night march to the Big Black, crossed the bridge there and,by moving north on the west side, have eluded us and finally returned toJohnston.  But this would have given us Vicksburg.  It would have beenhis proper move, however, and the one Johnston would have made had hebeen in Pemberton's place.  In fact it would have been in conformitywith Johnston's orders to Pemberton.Sherman left Jackson with the last of his troops about noon on the 16thand reached Bolton, twenty miles west, before halting.  His rear guarddid not get in until two A.M. the 17th, but renewed their march bydaylight.  He paroled his prisoners at Jackson, and was forced to leavehis own wounded in care of surgeons and attendants.  At Bolton he wasinformed of our victory.  He was directed to commence the march earlynext day, and to diverge from the road he was on to Bridgeport on theBig Black River, some eleven miles above the point where we expected tofind the enemy.  Blair was ordered to join him there with the pontoontrain as early as possible.This movement brought Sherman's corps together, and at a point where Ihoped a crossing of the Big Black might be effected and Sherman's corpsused to flank the enemy out of his position in our front, thus opening acrossing for the remainder of the army.  I informed him that I wouldendeavor to hold the enemy in my front while he crossed the river.The advance division, Carr's (McClernand's corps), resumed the pursuitat half-past three A.M. on the 17th, followed closely by Osterhaus,McPherson bringing up the rear with his corps.  As I expected, the enemywas found in position on the Big Black.  The point was only six milesfrom that where my advance had rested for the night, and was reached atan early hour.  Here the river makes a turn to the west, and has washedclose up to the high land; the east side is a low bottom, sometimesoverflowed at very high water, but was cleared and in cultivation.  Abayou runs irregularly across this low land, the bottom of which,however, is above the surface of the Big Black at ordinary stages.  Whenthe river is full water runs through it, converting the point of landinto an island.  The bayou was grown up with timber, which the enemy hadfelled into the ditch.  At this time there was a foot or two of water init. The rebels had constructed a parapet along the inner bank of thisbayou by using cotton bales from the plantation close by and throwingdirt over them.  The whole was thoroughly commanded from the height westof the river.  At the upper end of the bayou there was a strip ofuncleared land which afforded a cover for a portion of our men.  Carr'sdivision was deployed on our right, Lawler's brigade forming his extremeright and reaching through these woods to the river above.  Osterhaus'division was deployed to the left of Carr and covered the enemy's entirefront.  McPherson was in column on the road, the head close by, ready tocome in wherever he could be of assistance.While the troops were standing as here described an officer from Banks'staff came up and presented me with a letter from General Halleck, datedthe 11th of May.  It had been sent by the way of New Orleans to Banks tobe forwarded to me.  It ordered me to return to Grand Gulf and toco-operate from there with Banks against Port Hudson, and then to returnwith our combined forces to besiege Vicksburg.  I told the officer thatthe order came too late, and that Halleck would not give it now if heknew our position.  The bearer of the dispatch insisted that I ought toobey the order, and was giving arguments to support his position when Iheard great cheering to the right of our line and, looking in thatdirection, saw Lawler in his shirt sleeves leading a charge upon theenemy.  I immediately mounted my horse and rode in the direction of thecharge, and saw no more of the officer who delivered the dispatch; Ithink not even to this day.The assault was successful.  But little resistance was made. The enemyfled from the west bank of the river, burning the bridge behind him andleaving the men and guns on the east side to fall into our hands.  Manytried to escape by swimming the river. Some succeeded and some weredrowned in the attempt. Eighteen guns were captured and 1,751 prisoners.Our loss was 39 killed, 237 wounded and 3 missing.  The enemy probablylost but few men except those captured and drowned.  But for thesuccessful and complete destruction of the bridge, I have but littledoubt that we should have followed the enemy so closely as to preventhis occupying his defences around Vicksburg.As the bridge was destroyed and the river was high, new bridges had tobe built.  It was but little after nine o'clock A.M. when the capturetook place.  As soon as work could be commenced, orders were given forthe construction of three bridges.  One was taken charge of byLieutenant Hains, of the Engineer Corps, one by General McPhersonhimself and one by General Ransom, a most gallant and intelligentvolunteer officer.  My recollection is that Hains built a raft bridge;McPherson a pontoon, using cotton bales in large numbers, for pontoons;and that Ransom felled trees on opposite banks of the river, cuttingonly on one side of the tree, so that they would fall with their topsinterlacing in the river, without the trees being entirely severed fromtheir stumps.  A bridge was then made with these trees to support theroadway.  Lumber was taken from buildings, cotton gins and whereverfound, for this purpose.  By eight o'clock in the morning of the 18thall three bridges were complete and the troops were crossing.Sherman reached Bridgeport about noon of the 17th and found Blair withthe pontoon train already there.  A few of the enemy were intrenched onthe west bank, but they made little resistance and soon surrendered.Two divisions were crossed that night and the third the followingmorning.On the 18th I moved along the Vicksburg road in advance of the troopsand as soon as possible joined Sherman.  My first anxiety was to securea base of supplies on the Yazoo River above Vicksburg.  Sherman's lineof march led him to the very point on Walnut Hills occupied by the enemythe December before when he was repulsed.  Sherman was equally anxiouswith myself.  Our impatience led us to move in advance of the column andwell up with the advanced skirmishers.  There were some detached worksalong the crest of the hill.  These were still occupied by the enemy, orelse the garrison from Haines' Bluff had not all got past on their wayto Vicksburg.  At all events the bullets of the enemy whistled by thickand fast for a short time.  In a few minutes Sherman had the pleasure oflooking down from the spot coveted so much by him the December before onthe ground where his command had lain so helpless for offensive action.He turned to me, saying that up to this minute he had felt no positiveassurance of success.  This, however, he said was the end of one of thegreatest campaigns in history and I ought to make a report of it atonce.  Vicksburg was not yet captured, and there was no telling whatmight happen before it was taken; but whether captured or not, this wasa complete and successful campaign.  I do not claim to quote Sherman'slanguage; but the substance only.  My reason for mentioning thisincident will appear further on.McPherson, after crossing the Big Black, came into the Jackson andVicksburg road which Sherman was on, but to his rear.  He arrived atnight near the lines of the enemy, and went into camp.  McClernand movedby the direct road near the railroad to Mount Albans, and then turned tothe left and put his troops on the road from Baldwin's ferry toVicksburg.  This brought him south of McPherson.  I now had my threecorps up the works built for the defence of Vicksburg, on three roads--one to the north, one to the east and one to the south-east of the city.By the morning of the 19th the investment was as complete as my limitednumber of troops would allow.  Sherman was on the right, and covered thehigh ground from where it overlooked the Yazoo as far south-east as histroops would extend.  McPherson joined on to his left, and occupiedground on both sides of the Jackson road.  McClernand took up the groundto his left and extended as far towards Warrenton as he could, keeping acontinuous line.On the 19th there was constant skirmishing with the enemy while we weregetting into better position.  The enemy had been much demoralized byhis defeats at Champion's Hill and the Big Black, and I believed hewould not make much effort to hold Vicksburg. Accordingly, at twoo'clock I ordered an assault.  It resulted in securing more advancedpositions for all our troops where they were fully covered from the fireof the enemy.The 20th and 21st were spent in strengthening our position and in makingroads in rear of the army, from Yazoo River or Chickasaw Bayou.  Most ofthe army had now been for three weeks with only five days' rationsissued by the commissary.  They had an abundance of food, however, butbegan to feel the want of bread.  I remember that in passing around tothe left of the line on the 21st, a soldier, recognizing me, said inrather a low voice, but yet so that I heard him, 'Hard tack.'  In amoment the cry was taken up all along the line, 'Hard tack! Hard tack!'I told the men nearest to me that we had been engaged ever since thearrival of the troops in building a road over which to supply them witheverything they needed.  The cry was instantly changed to cheers.  Bythe night of the 21st all the troops had full rations issued to them.The bread and coffee were highly appreciated.I now determined on a second assault.  Johnston was in my rear, onlyfifty miles away, with an army not much inferior in numbers to the one Ihad with me, and I knew he was being reinforced. There was danger of hiscoming to the assistance of Pemberton, and after all he might defeat myanticipations of capturing the garrison if, indeed, he did not preventthe capture of the city.  The immediate capture of Vicksburg would savesending me the reinforcements which were so much wanted elsewhere, andwould set free the army under me to drive Johnston from the State.  Butthe first consideration of all was--the troops believed they could carrythe works in their front, and would not have worked so patiently in thetrenches if they had not been allowed to try.The attack was ordered to commence on all parts of the line at teno'clock A.M. on the 22d with a furious cannonade from every battery inposition.  All the corps commanders set their time by mine so that allmight open the engagement at the same minute. The attack was gallant,and portions of each of the three corps succeeded in getting up to thevery parapets of the enemy and in planting their battle flags upon them;but at no place were we able to enter.  General McClernand reported thathe had gained the enemy's intrenchments at several points, and wantedreinforcements.  I occupied a position from which I believed I could seeas well as he what took place in his front, and I did not see thesuccess he reported.  But his request for reinforcements being repeatedI could not ignore it, and sent him Quinby's division of the 17th corps.Sherman and McPherson were both ordered to renew their assaults as adiversion in favor of McClernand.  This last attack only served toincrease our casualties without giving any benefit whatever.  As soon asit was dark our troops that had reached the enemy's line and beenobliged to remain there for security all day, were withdrawn; and thusended the last assault upon Vicksburg.
ISFP	 XXXVIISIEGE OF VICKSBURG.I now determined upon a regular siege--to 'out-camp the enemy,' as itwere, and to incur no more losses.  The experience of the 22d convincedofficers and men that this was best, and they went to work on thedefences and approaches with a will.  With the navy holding the river,the investment of Vicksburg was complete.  As long as we could hold ourposition the enemy was limited in supplies of food, men and munitions ofwar to what they had on hand.  These could not last always.The crossing of troops at Bruinsburg commenced April 30th.  On the 18thof May the army was in rear of Vicksburg.  On the 19th, just twenty daysafter the crossing, the city was completely invested and an assault hadbeen made:  five distinct battles (besides continuous skirmishing) hadbeen fought and won by the Union forces; the capital of the State hadfallen and its arsenals, military manufactories and everything usefulfor military purposes had been destroyed; an average of about onehundred and eighty miles had been marched by the troops engaged; butfive days' rations had been issued, and no forage; over six thousandprisoners had been captured, and as many more of the enemy had beenkilled or wounded; twenty-seven heavy cannon and sixty-one field-pieceshad fallen into our hands; and four hundred miles of the river, fromVicksburg to Port Hudson, had become ours.  The Union force that hadcrossed the Mississippi River up to this time was less than forty-threethousand men. One division of these, Blair's, only arrived in time totake part in the battle of Champion's Hill, but was not engaged there;and one brigade, Ransom's of McPherson's corps, reached the field afterthe battle.  The enemy had at Vicksburg, Grand Gulf, Jackson, and on theroads between these places, over sixty thousand men.  They were in theirown country, where no rear guards were necessary.  The country isadmirable for defence, but difficult for the conduct of an offensivecampaign.  All their troops had to be met.  We were fortunate, to saythe least, in meeting them in detail:  at Port Gibson seven or eightthousand; at Raymond, five thousand; at Jackson, from eight to eleventhousand; at Champion's Hill, twenty-five thousand; at the Big Black,four thousand.  A part of those met at Jackson were all that was left ofthose encountered at Raymond.  They were beaten in detail by a forcesmaller than their own, upon their own ground.  Our loss up to this timewas:                             KILLED  WOUNDED  MISSING Port Gibson.....              131     719      25 South Fork Bayou Pierre.....   ..       1      ..

Total.....                    695   3,425     259Of the wounded many were but slightly so, and continued on duty.  Nothalf of them were disabled for any length of time.After the unsuccessful assault of the 22d the work of the regular siegebegan.  Sherman occupied the right starting from the river aboveVicksburg, McPherson the centre (McArthur's division now with him) andMcClernand the left, holding the road south to Warrenton.  Lauman'sdivision arrived at this time and was placed on the extreme left of theline.In the interval between the assaults of the 19th and 22d, roads had beencompleted from the Yazoo River and Chickasaw Bayou, around the rear ofthe army, to enable us to bring up supplies of food and ammunition;ground had been selected and cleared on which the troops were to beencamped, and tents and cooking utensils were brought up.  The troopshad been without these from the time of crossing the Mississippi up tothis time.  All was now ready for the pick and spade.  Prentiss andHurlbut were ordered to send forward every man that could be spared.Cavalry especially was wanted to watch the fords along the Big Black,and to observe Johnston.  I knew that Johnston was receivingreinforcements from Bragg, who was confronting Rosecrans in Tennessee.Vicksburg was so important to the enemy that I believed he would makethe most strenuous efforts to raise the siege, even at the risk oflosing ground elsewhere.My line was more than fifteen miles long, extending from Haines' Bluffto Vicksburg, thence to Warrenton.  The line of the enemy was aboutseven.  In addition to this, having an enemy at Canton and Jackson, inour rear, who was being constantly reinforced, we required a second lineof defence facing the other way.  I had not troops enough under mycommand to man these.  General Halleck appreciated the situation and,without being asked, forwarded reinforcements with all possibledispatch.The ground about Vicksburg is admirable for defence.  On the north it isabout two hundred feet above the Mississippi River at the highest pointand very much cut up by the washing rains; the ravines were grown upwith cane and underbrush, while the sides and tops were covered with adense forest.  Farther south the ground flattens out somewhat, and wasin cultivation.  But here, too, it was cut up by ravines and smallstreams.  The enemy's line of defence followed the crest of a ridge fromthe river north of the city eastward, then southerly around to theJackson road, full three miles back of the city; thence in asouthwesterly direction to the river.  Deep ravines of the descriptiongiven lay in front of these defences.  As there is a succession ofgullies, cut out by rains along the side of the ridge, the line wasnecessarily very irregular.  To follow each of these spurs withintrenchments, so as to command the slopes on either side, would havelengthened their line very much. Generally therefore, or in many places,their line would run from near the head of one gully nearly straight tothe head of another, and an outer work triangular in shape, generallyopen in the rear, was thrown up on the point; with a few men in thisouter work they commanded the approaches to the main line completely.The work to be done, to make our position as strong against the enemy ashis was against us, was very great.  The problem was also complicated byour wanting our line as near that of the enemy as possible.  We had butfour engineer officers with us. Captain Prime, of the Engineer Corps,was the chief, and the work at the beginning was mainly directed by him.His health soon gave out, when he was succeeded by Captain Comstock,also of the Engineer Corps.  To provide assistants on such a long line Idirected that all officers who had graduated at West Point, where theyhad necessarily to study military engineering, should in addition totheir other duties assist in the work.The chief quartermaster and the chief commissary were graduates.  Thechief commissary, now the Commissary-General of the Army, begged off,however, saying that there was nothing in engineering that he was goodfor unless he would do for a sap-roller.  As soldiers require rationswhile working in the ditches as well as when marching and fighting, andas we would be sure to lose him if he was used as a sap-roller, I lethim off.  The general is a large man; weighs two hundred and twentypounds, and is not tall.We had no siege guns except six thirty-two pounders, and there were noneat the West to draw from.  Admiral Porter, however, supplied us with abattery of navy-guns of large calibre, and with these, and the fieldartillery used in the campaign, the siege began.  The first thing to dowas to get the artillery in batteries where they would occupy commandingpositions; then establish the camps, under cover from the fire of theenemy but as near up as possible; and then construct rifle-pits andcovered ways, to connect the entire command by the shortest route.  Theenemy did not harass us much while we were constructing our batteries.Probably their artillery ammunition was short; and their infantry waskept down by our sharpshooters, who were always on the alert and readyto fire at a head whenever it showed itself above the rebel works.In no place were our lines more than six hundred yards from the enemy.It was necessary, therefore, to cover our men by something more thanthe ordinary parapet.  To give additional protection sand bags,bullet-proof, were placed along the tops of the parapets far enoughapart to make loop-holes for musketry.  On top of these, logs were put.By these means the men were enabled to walk about erect when off duty,without fear of annoyance from sharpshooters.  The enemy used in theirdefence explosive musket-balls, no doubt thinking that, bursting overour men in the trenches, they would do some execution; but I do notremember a single case where a man was injured by a piece of one ofthese shells. When they were hit and the ball exploded, the wound wasterrible.  In these cases a solid ball would have hit as well.  Theiruse is barbarous, because they produce increased suffering without anycorresponding advantage to those using them.The enemy could not resort to our method to protect their men, becausewe had an inexhaustible supply of ammunition to draw upon and used itfreely.  Splinters from the timber would have made havoc among the menbehind.There were no mortars with the besiegers, except what the navy had infront of the city; but wooden ones were made by taking logs of thetoughest wood that could be found, boring them out for six or twelvepound shells and binding them with strong iron bands.  These answered ascochorns, and shells were successfully thrown from them into thetrenches of the enemy.The labor of building the batteries and intrenching was largely done bythe pioneers, assisted by negroes who came within our lines and who werepaid for their work; but details from the troops had often to be made.The work was pushed forward as rapidly as possible, and when an advancedposition was secured and covered from the fire of the enemy thebatteries were advanced.  By the 30th of June there were two hundred andtwenty guns in position, mostly light field-pieces, besides a battery ofheavy guns belonging to, manned and commanded by the navy.  We were nowas strong for defence against the garrison of Vicksburg as they wereagainst us; but I knew that Johnston was in our rear, and was receivingconstant reinforcements from the east. He had at this time a largerforce than I had had at any time prior to the battle of Champion's Hill.As soon as the news of the arrival of the Union army behind Vicksburgreached the North, floods of visitors began to pour in.  Some came togratify curiosity; some to see sons or brothers who had passed throughthe terrible ordeal; members of the Christian and Sanitary Associationscame to minister to the wants of the sick and the wounded.  Often thosecoming to see a son or brother would bring a dozen or two of poultry.They did not know how little the gift would be appreciated.  Many of thesoldiers had lived so much on chickens, ducks and turkeys without breadduring the march, that the sight of poultry, if they could get bacon,almost took away their appetite.  But the intention was good.Among the earliest arrivals was the Governor of Illinois, with most ofthe State officers.  I naturally wanted to show them what there was ofmost interest.  In Sherman's front the ground was the most broken andmost wooded, and more was to be seen without exposure.  I therefore tookthem to Sherman's headquarters and presented them.  Before starting outto look at the lines--possibly while Sherman's horse was being saddled--there were many questions asked about the late campaign, about whichthe North had been so imperfectly informed.  There was a little knotaround Sherman and another around me, and I heard Sherman repeating, inthe most animated manner, what he had said to me when we first lookeddown from Walnut Hills upon the land below on the 18th of May, adding:'Grant is entitled to every bit of the credit for the campaign; Iopposed it. I wrote him a letter about it.'  But for this speech it isnot likely that Sherman's opposition would have ever been heard of.  Hisuntiring energy and great efficiency during the campaign entitle him toa full share of all the credit due for its success.  He could not havedone more if the plan had been his own. (*13)On the 26th of May I sent Blair's division up the Yazoo to drive out aforce of the enemy supposed to be between the Big Black and the Yazoo.The country was rich and full of supplies of both food and forage.Blair was instructed to take all of it.  The cattle were to be driven infor the use of our army, and the food and forage to be consumed by ourtroops or destroyed by fire; all bridges were to be destroyed, and theroads rendered as nearly impassable as possible.  Blair went forty-fivemiles and was gone almost a week.  His work was effectually done.  Irequested Porter at this time to send the marine brigade, a floatingnondescript force which had been assigned to his command and whichproved very useful, up to Haines' Bluff to hold it until reinforcementscould be sent.On the 26th I also received a letter from Banks, asking me to reinforcehim with ten thousand men at Port Hudson.  Of course I could not complywith his request, nor did I think he needed them.  He was in no dangerof an attack by the garrison in his front, and there was no armyorganizing in his rear to raise the siege.On the 3d of June a brigade from Hurlbut's command arrived, GeneralKimball commanding.  It was sent to Mechanicsburg, some miles north-eastof Haines' Bluff and about midway between the Big Black and the Yazoo.A brigade of Blair's division and twelve hundred cavalry had already, onBlair's return from the Yazoo, been sent to the same place withinstructions to watch the crossings of the Big Black River, to destroythe roads in his (Blair's) front, and to gather or destroy all supplies.On the 7th of June our little force of colored and white troops acrossthe Mississippi, at Milliken's Bend, were attacked by about 3,000 menfrom Richard Taylor's trans-Mississippi command.  With the aid of thegunboats they were speedily repelled.  I sent Mower's brigade over withinstructions to drive the enemy beyond the Tensas Bayou; and we had nofurther trouble in that quarter during the siege.  This was the firstimportant engagement of the war in which colored troops were under fire.These men were very raw, having all been enlisted since the beginning ofthe siege, but they behaved well.On the 8th of June a full division arrived from Hurlbut's command, underGeneral Sooy Smith.  It was sent immediately to Haines' Bluff, andGeneral C. C. Washburn was assigned to the general command at thatpoint.On the 11th a strong division arrived from the Department of theMissouri under General Herron, which was placed on our left. This cutoff the last possible chance of communication between Pemberton andJohnston, as it enabled Lauman to close up on McClernand's left whileHerron intrenched from Lauman to the water's edge.  At this point thewater recedes a few hundred yards from the high land.  Through thisopening no doubt the Confederate commanders had been able to getmessengers under cover of night.On the 14th General Parke arrived with two divisions of Burnside'scorps, and was immediately dispatched to Haines' Bluff.  These lattertroops--Herron's and Parke's--were the reinforcements already spoken ofsent by Halleck in anticipation of their being needed.  They arrivednone too soon.I now had about seventy-one thousand men.  More than half were disposedacross the peninsula, between the Yazoo at Haines' Bluff and the BigBlack, with the division of Osterhaus watching the crossings of thelatter river farther south and west from the crossing of the Jacksonroad to Baldwin's ferry and below.There were eight roads leading into Vicksburg, along which and theirimmediate sides, our work was specially pushed and batteries advanced;but no commanding point within range of the enemy was neglected.On the 17th I received a letter from General Sherman and one on the 18thfrom General McPherson, saying that their respective commands hadcomplained to them of a fulsome, congratulatory order published byGeneral McClernand to the 13th corps, which did great injustice to theother troops engaged in the campaign.  This order had been sent Northand published, and now papers containing it had reached our camps.  Theorder had not been heard of by me, and certainly not by troops outsideof McClernand's command until brought in this way.  I at once wrote toMcClernand, directing him to send me a copy of this order.  He did so,and I at once relieved him from the command of the 13th army corps andordered him back to Springfield, Illinois.  The publication of his orderin the press was in violation of War Department orders and also of mine.
ISFP	 LXVI.BATTLE OF SAILOR'S CREEK--ENGAGEMENT AT FARMVILLE--CORRESPONDENCE WITHGENERAL LEE--SHERIDAN INTERCEPTS THE ENEMY.The Appomattox, going westward, takes a long sweep to the south-westfrom the neighborhood of the Richmond and Danville Railroad bridge, andthen trends north-westerly.  Sailor's Creek, an insignificant stream,running northward, empties into the Appomattox between the High Bridgeand Jetersville.  Near the High Bridge the stage road from Petersburg toLynchburg crosses the Appomattox River, also on a bridge.  The railroadruns on the north side of the river to Farmville, a few miles west, andfrom there, recrossing, continues on the south side of it.  The roadscoming up from the south-east to Farmville cross the Appomattox Riverthere on a bridge and run on the north side, leaving the Lynchburg andPetersburg Railroad well to the left.Lee, in pushing out from Amelia Court House, availed himself of all theroads between the Danville Road and Appomattox River to move upon, andnever permitted the head of his columns to stop because of any fightingthat might be going on in his rear.  In this way he came very nearsucceeding in getting to his provision trains and eluding us with atleast part of his army.As expected, Lee's troops had moved during the night before, and ourarmy in moving upon Amelia Court House soon encountered them.  There wasa good deal of fighting before Sailor's Creek was reached.  Our cavalrycharged in upon a body of theirs which was escorting a wagon train inorder to get it past our left.  A severe engagement ensued, in which wecaptured many prisoners, and many men also were killed and wounded.There was as much gallantry displayed by some of the Confederates inthese little engagements as was displayed at any time during the war,notwithstanding the sad defeats of the past week.The armies finally met on Sailor's Creek, when a heavy engagement tookplace, in which infantry, artillery and cavalry were all brought intoaction.  Our men on the right, as they were brought in against theenemy, came in on higher ground, and upon his flank, giving us everyadvantage to be derived from the lay of the country.  Our firing wasalso very much more rapid, because the enemy commenced his retreatwestward and in firing as he retreated had to turn around every time hefired.  The enemy's loss was very heavy, as well in killed and woundedas in captures.  Some six general officers fell into our hands in thisengagement, and seven thousand men were made prisoners.  This engagementwas commenced in the middle of the afternoon of the 6th, and the retreatand pursuit were continued until nightfall, when the armies bivouackedupon the ground where the night had overtaken them.When the move towards Amelia Court House had commenced that morning, Iordered Wright's corps, which was on the extreme right, to be moved tothe left past the whole army, to take the place of Griffin's, andordered the latter at the same time to move by and place itself on theright.  The object of this movement was to get the 6th corps, Wright's,next to the cavalry, with which they had formerly served so harmoniouslyand so efficiently in the valley of Virginia.The 6th corps now remained with the cavalry and under Sheridan's directcommand until after the surrender.Ord had been directed to take possession of all the roads southwardbetween Burkesville and the High Bridge.  On the morning of the 6th hesent Colonel Washburn with two infantry regiments with instructions todestroy High Bridge and to return rapidly to Burkesville Station; and heprepared himself to resist the enemy there.  Soon after Washburn hadstarted Ord became a little alarmed as to his safety and sent ColonelRead, of his staff, with about eighty cavalrymen, to overtake him andbring him back.  Very shortly after this he heard that the head of Lee'scolumn had got up to the road between him and where Washburn now was,and attempted to send reinforcements, but the reinforcements could notget through.  Read, however, had got through ahead of the enemy.  Herode on to Farmville and was on his way back again when he found hisreturn cut off, and Washburn confronting apparently the advance of Lee'sarmy.  Read drew his men up into line of battle, his force nowconsisting of less than six hundred men, infantry and cavalry, and rodealong their front, making a speech to his men to inspire them with thesame enthusiasm that he himself felt.  He then gave the order to charge.This little band made several charges, of course unsuccessful ones, butinflicted a loss upon the enemy more than equal to their own entirenumber.  Colonel Read fell mortally wounded, and then Washburn; and atthe close of the conflict nearly every officer of the command and mostof the rank and file had been either killed or wounded.  The remainderthen surrendered.  The Confederates took this to be only the advance ofa larger column which had headed them off, and so stopped to intrench;so that this gallant band of six hundred had checked the progress of astrong detachment of the Confederate army.This stoppage of Lee's column no doubt saved to us the trains following.Lee himself pushed on and crossed the wagon road bridge near the HighBridge, and attempted to destroy it.  He did set fire to it, but theflames had made but little headway when Humphreys came up with his corpsand drove away the rear-guard which had been left to protect it while itwas being burned up.  Humphreys forced his way across with some loss,and followed Lee to the intersection of the road crossing at Farmvillewith the one from Petersburg.  Here Lee held a position which was verystrong, naturally, besides being intrenched.  Humphreys was alone,confronting him all through the day, and in a very hazardous position.He put on a bold face, however, and assaulted with some loss, but wasnot assaulted in return.Our cavalry had gone farther south by the way of Prince Edward's CourtHouse, along with the 5th corps (Griffin's), Ord falling in betweenGriffin and the Appomattox.  Crook's division of cavalry and Wright'scorps pushed on west of Farmville.  When the cavalry reached Farmvillethey found that some of the Confederates were in ahead of them, and hadalready got their trains of provisions back to that point; but ourtroops were in time to prevent them from securing anything to eat,although they succeeded in again running the trains off, so that we didnot get them for some time.  These troops retreated to the north side ofthe Appomattox to join Lee, and succeeded in destroying the bridge afterthem.  Considerable fighting ensued there between Wright's corps and aportion of our cavalry and the Confederates, but finally the cavalryforded the stream and drove them away.  Wright built a foot-bridge forhis men to march over on and then marched out to the junction of theroads to relieve Humphreys, arriving there that night.  I had stoppedthe night before at Burkesville Junction.  Our troops were then prettymuch all out of the place, but we had a field hospital there, and Ord'scommand was extended from that point towards Farmville.Here I met Dr. Smith, a Virginian and an officer of the regular army,who told me that in a conversation with General Ewell, one of theprisoners and a relative of his, Ewell had said that when we had gotacross the James River he knew their cause was lost, and it was the dutyof their authorities to make the best terms they could while they stillhad a right to claim concessions. The authorities thought differently,however.  Now the cause was lost and they had no right to claimanything.  He said further, that for every man that was killed afterthis in the war somebody is responsible, and it would be but very littlebetter than murder.  He was not sure that Lee would consent to surrenderhis army without being able to consult with the President, but he hopedhe would.I rode in to Farmville on the 7th, arriving there early in the day.Sheridan and Ord were pushing through, away to the south.  Meade wasback towards the High Bridge, and Humphreys confronting Lee as beforestated.  After having gone into bivouac at Prince Edward's Court House,Sheridan learned that seven trains of provisions and forage were atAppomattox, and determined to start at once and capture them; and aforced march was necessary in order to get there before Lee's army couldsecure them.  He wrote me a note telling me this.  This fact, togetherwith the incident related the night before by Dr. Smith, gave me theidea of opening correspondence with General Lee on the subject of thesurrender of his army.  I therefore wrote to him on this day, asfollows:HEADQUARTERS ARMIES OF THE U. S., 5 P.M., April 7, 1865.GENERAL R. E. LEE Commanding C. S. A.The result of the last week must convince you of the hopelessness offurther resistance on the part of the Army of Northern Virginia in thisstruggle.  I feel that it is so, and regard it as my duty to shift frommyself the responsibility of any further effusion of blood, by asking ofyou the surrender of that portion of the Confederate States army knownas the Army of Northern Virginia.U. S. GRANT, Lieut.-General.Lee replied on the evening of the same day as follows:April 7, 1865.GENERAL:  I have received your note of this day.  Though notentertaining the opinion you express on the hopelessness of furtherresistance on the part of the Army of Northern Virginia, I reciprocateyour desire to avoid useless effusion of blood, and therefore beforeconsidering your proposition, ask the terms you will offer on conditionof its surrender.R. E. LEE, General.LIEUT.-GENERAL U. S. GRANT, Commanding Armies of the U. S.This was not satisfactory, but I regarded it as deserving another letterand wrote him as follows:April 8, 1865.GENERAL R. E. LEE, Commanding C. S. A.Your note of last evening in reply to mine of same date, asking thecondition on which I will accept the surrender of the Army of NorthernVirginia is just received.  In reply I would say that, peace being mygreat desire, there is but one condition I would insist upon, namely:that the men and officers surrendered shall be disqualified for takingup arms again against the Government of the United States until properlyexchanged.  I will meet you, or will designate officers to meet anyofficers you may name for the same purpose, at any point agreeable toyou, for the purpose of arranging definitely the terms upon which thesurrender of the Army of Northern Virginia will be received.U. S. GRANT, Lieut.-General.Lee's army was rapidly crumbling.  Many of his soldiers had enlistedfrom that part of the State where they now were, and were continuallydropping out of the ranks and going to their homes.  I know that Ioccupied a hotel almost destitute of furniture at Farmville, which hadprobably been used as a Confederate hospital.  The next morning when Icame out I found a Confederate colonel there, who reported to me andsaid that he was the proprietor of that house, and that he was a colonelof a regiment that had been raised in that neighborhood.  He said thatwhen he came along past home, he found that he was the only man of theregiment remaining with Lee's army, so he just dropped out, and nowwanted to surrender himself.  I told him to stay there and he would notbe molested.  That was one regiment which had been eliminated from Lee'sforce by this crumbling process.Although Sheridan had been marching all day, his troops moved withalacrity and without any straggling.  They began to see the end of whatthey had been fighting four years for.  Nothing seemed to fatigue them.They were ready to move without rations and travel without rest untilthe end.  Straggling had entirely ceased, and every man was now a rivalfor the front.  The infantry marched about as rapidly as the cavalrycould.Sheridan sent Custer with his division to move south of AppomattoxStation, which is about five miles south-west of the Court House, to getwest of the trains and destroy the roads to the rear.  They got therethe night of the 8th, and succeeded partially; but some of the train menhad just discovered the movement of our troops and succeeded in runningoff three of the trains.  The other four were held by Custer.The head of Lee's column came marching up there on the morning of the9th, not dreaming, I suppose, that there were any Union soldiers near.The Confederates were surprised to find our cavalry had possession ofthe trains.  However, they were desperate and at once assaulted, hopingto recover them.  In the melee that ensued they succeeded in burning oneof the trains, but not in getting anything from it.  Custer then orderedthe other trains run back on the road towards Farmville, and the fightcontinued.So far, only our cavalry and the advance of Lee's army were engaged.Soon, however, Lee's men were brought up from the rear, no doubtexpecting they had nothing to meet but our cavalry.  But our infantryhad pushed forward so rapidly that by the time the enemy got up theyfound Griffin's corps and the Army of the James confronting them.  Asharp engagement ensued, but Lee quickly set up a white flag.
ISFP	 LXVII.NEGOTIATIONS AT APPOMATTOX--INTERVIEW WITH LEE AT MCLEAN'S HOUSE--THETERMS OF SURRENDER--LEE'S SURRENDER--INTERVIEW WITH LEE AFTER THESURRENDER.On the 8th I had followed the Army of the Potomac in rear of Lee.  I wassuffering very severely with a sick headache, and stopped at a farmhouseon the road some distance in rear of the main body of the army.  I spentthe night in bathing my feet in hot water and mustard, and puttingmustard plasters on my wrists and the back part of my neck, hoping to becured by morning. During the night I received Lee's answer to my letterof the 8th, inviting an interview between the lines on the followingmorning. (*43)  But it was for a different purpose from that ofsurrendering his army, and I answered him as follows:HEADQUARTERS ARMIES OF THE U. S., April 9, 1865.GENERAL R. E. LEE, Commanding C. S. A.Your note of yesterday is received.  As I have no authority to treat onthe subject of peace, the meeting proposed for ten A.M. to-day couldlead to no good.  I will state, however, General, that I am equallyanxious for peace with yourself, and the whole North entertains the samefeeling.  The terms upon which peace can be had are well understood.  Bythe South laying down their arms they will hasten that most desirableevent, save thousands of human lives and hundreds of millions ofproperty not yet destroyed.  Sincerely hoping that all our difficultiesmay be settled without the loss of another life, I subscribe myself,etc.,U. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General.I proceeded at an early hour in the morning, still suffering with theheadache, to get to the head of the column.  I was not more than two orthree miles from Appomattox Court House at the time, but to go direct Iwould have to pass through Lee's army, or a portion of it.  I hadtherefore to move south in order to get upon a road coming up fromanother direction.When the white flag was put out by Lee, as already described, I was inthis way moving towards Appomattox Court House, and consequently couldnot be communicated with immediately, and be informed of what Lee haddone.  Lee, therefore, sent a flag to the rear to advise Meade and oneto the front to Sheridan, saying that he had sent a message to me forthe purpose of having a meeting to consult about the surrender of hisarmy, and asked for a suspension of hostilities until I could becommunicated with.  As they had heard nothing of this until the fightinghad got to be severe and all going against Lee, both of these commandershesitated very considerably about suspending hostilities at all.  Theywere afraid it was not in good faith, and we had the Army of NorthernVirginia where it could not escape except by some deception.  They,however, finally consented to a suspension of hostilities for two hoursto give an opportunity of communicating with me in that time, ifpossible.  It was found that, from the route I had taken, they wouldprobably not be able to communicate with me and get an answer backwithin the time fixed unless the messenger should pass through the rebellines.Lee, therefore, sent an escort with the officer bearing this messagethrough his lines to me.April 9, 1865.GENERAL:  I received your note of this morning on the picket-linewhither I had come to meet you and ascertain definitely what terms wereembraced in your proposal of yesterday with reference to the surrenderof this army.  I now request an interview in accordance with the offercontained in your letter of yesterday for that purpose.R. E. LEE, General.LIEUTENANT-GENERAL U. S. GRANT Commanding U. S. Armies.When the officer reached me I was still suffering with the sickheadache, but the instant I saw the contents of the note I was cured.  Iwrote the following note in reply and hastened on:April 9, 1865.GENERAL R. E. LEE, Commanding C. S. Armies.Your note of this date is but this moment (11.50 A.M.) received, inconsequence of my having passed from the Richmond and Lynchburg road tothe Farmville and Lynchburg road.  I am at this writing about four mileswest of Walker's Church and will push forward to the front for thepurpose of meeting you. Notice sent to me on this road where you wishthe interview to take place will meet me.U. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General.I was conducted at once to where Sheridan was located with his troopsdrawn up in line of battle facing the Confederate army near by.  Theywere very much excited, and expressed their view that this was all aruse employed to enable the Confederates to get away.  They said theybelieved that Johnston was marching up from North Carolina now, and Leewas moving to join him; and they would whip the rebels where they nowwere in five minutes if I would only let them go in.  But I had no doubtabout the good faith of Lee, and pretty soon was conducted to where hewas.  I found him at the house of a Mr. McLean, at Appomattox CourtHouse, with Colonel Marshall, one of his staff officers, awaiting myarrival.  The head of his column was occupying a hill, on a portion ofwhich was an apple orchard, beyond a little valley which separated itfrom that on the crest of which Sheridan's forces were drawn up in lineof battle to the south.Before stating what took place between General Lee and myself, I willgive all there is of the story of the famous apple tree.Wars produce many stories of fiction, some of which are told until theyare believed to be true.  The war of the rebellion was no exception tothis rule, and the story of the apple tree is one of those fictionsbased on a slight foundation of fact. As I have said, there was an appleorchard on the side of the hill occupied by the Confederate forces.Running diagonally up the hill was a wagon road, which, at one point,ran very near one of the trees, so that the wheels of vehicles had, onthat side, cut off the roots of this tree, leaving a little embankment.General Babcock, of my staff, reported to me that when he first metGeneral Lee he was sitting upon this embankment with his feet in theroad below and his back resting against the tree.  The story had noother foundation than that.  Like many other stories, it would be verygood if it was only true.I had known General Lee in the old army, and had served with him in theMexican War; but did not suppose, owing to the difference in our age andrank, that he would remember me, while I would more naturally rememberhim distinctly, because he was the chief of staff of General Scott inthe Mexican War.When I had left camp that morning I had not expected so soon the resultthat was then taking place, and consequently was in rough garb.  I waswithout a sword, as I usually was when on horseback on the field, andwore a soldier's blouse for a coat, with the shoulder straps of my rankto indicate to the army who I was. When I went into the house I foundGeneral Lee.  We greeted each other, and after shaking hands took ourseats.  I had my staff with me, a good portion of whom were in the roomduring the whole of the interview.What General Lee's feelings were I do not know.  As he was a man of muchdignity, with an impassible face, it was impossible to say whether hefelt inwardly glad that the end had finally come, or felt sad over theresult, and was too manly to show it. Whatever his feelings, they wereentirely concealed from my observation; but my own feelings, which hadbeen quite jubilant on the receipt of his letter, were sad anddepressed.  I felt like anything rather than rejoicing at the downfallof a foe who had fought so long and valiantly, and had suffered so muchfor a cause, though that cause was, I believe, one of the worst forwhich a people ever fought, and one for which there was the leastexcuse.  I do not question, however, the sincerity of the great mass ofthose who were opposed to us.General Lee was dressed in a full uniform which was entirely new, andwas wearing a sword of considerable value, very likely the sword whichhad been presented by the State of Virginia; at all events, it was anentirely different sword from the one that would ordinarily be worn inthe field.  In my rough traveling suit, the uniform of a private withthe straps of a lieutenant-general, I must have contrasted verystrangely with a man so handsomely dressed, six feet high and offaultless form. But this was not a matter that I thought of untilafterwards.We soon fell into a conversation about old army times.  He remarked thathe remembered me very well in the old army; and I told him that as amatter of course I remembered him perfectly, but from the difference inour rank and years (there being about sixteen years' difference in ourages), I had thought it very likely that I had not attracted hisattention sufficiently to be remembered by him after such a longinterval.  Our conversation grew so pleasant that I almost forgot theobject of our meeting.  After the conversation had run on in this stylefor some time, General Lee called my attention to the object of ourmeeting, and said that he had asked for this interview for the purposeof getting from me the terms I proposed to give his army.  I said that Imeant merely that his army should lay down their arms, not to take themup again during the continuance of the war unless duly and properlyexchanged.  He said that he had so understood my letter.Then we gradually fell off again into conversation about matters foreignto the subject which had brought us together.  This continued for somelittle time, when General Lee again interrupted the course of theconversation by suggesting that the terms I proposed to give his armyought to be written out. I called to General Parker, secretary on mystaff, for writing materials, and commenced writing out the followingterms:APPOMATTOX C. H., VA.,Ap 19th, 1865.GEN. R. E. LEE, Comd'g C. S. A.GEN:  In accordance with the substance of my letter to you of the 8thinst., I propose to receive the surrender of the Army of N. Va. on thefollowing terms, to wit:  Rolls of all the officers and men to be madein duplicate.  One copy to be given to an officer designated by me, theother to be retained by such officer or officers as you may designate.The officers to give their individual paroles not to take up armsagainst the Government of the United States until properly exchanged,and each company or regimental commander sign a like parole for the menof their commands.  The arms, artillery and public property to be parkedand stacked, and turned over to the officer appointed by me to receivethem.  This will not embrace the side-arms of the officers, nor theirprivate horses or baggage.  This done, each officer and man will beallowed to return to their homes, not to be disturbed by United Statesauthority so long as they observe their paroles and the laws in forcewhere they may reside.Very respectfully, U. S. GRANT, Lt. Gen.When I put my pen to the paper I did not know the first word that Ishould make use of in writing the terms.  I only knew what was in mymind, and I wished to express it clearly, so that there could be nomistaking it.  As I wrote on, the thought occurred to me that theofficers had their own private horses and effects, which were importantto them, but of no value to us; also that it would be an unnecessaryhumiliation to call upon them to deliver their side arms.No conversation, not one word, passed between General Lee and myself,either about private property, side arms, or kindred subjects.  Heappeared to have no objections to the terms first proposed; or if he hada point to make against them he wished to wait until they were inwriting to make it.  When he read over that part of the terms about sidearms, horses and private property of the officers, he remarked, withsome feeling, I thought, that this would have a happy effect upon hisarmy.Then, after a little further conversation, General Lee remarked to meagain that their army was organized a little differently from the armyof the United States (still maintaining by implication that we were twocountries); that in their army the cavalrymen and artillerists ownedtheir own horses; and he asked if he was to understand that the men whoso owned their horses were to be permitted to retain them.  I told himthat as the terms were written they would not; that only the officerswere permitted to take their private property.  He then, after readingover the terms a second time, remarked that that was clear.I then said to him that I thought this would be about the last battle ofthe war--I sincerely hoped so; and I said further I took it that most ofthe men in the ranks were small farmers. The whole country had been soraided by the two armies that it was doubtful whether they would be ableto put in a crop to carry themselves and their families through the nextwinter without the aid of the horses they were then riding.  The UnitedStates did not want them and I would, therefore, instruct the officers Ileft behind to receive the paroles of his troops to let every man of theConfederate army who claimed to own a horse or mule take the animal tohis home.  Lee remarked again that this would have a happy effect.He then sat down and wrote out the following letter:HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF NORTHERN VIRGINIA, April 9, 1865.GENERAL:--I received your letter of this date containing the terms ofthe surrender of the Army of Northern Virginia as proposed by you.  Asthey are substantially the same as those expressed in your letter of the8th inst., they are accepted.  I will proceed to designate the properofficers to carry the stipulations into effect.R. E. LEE, General. LIEUT.-GENERAL U. S. GRANT.While duplicates of the two letters were being made, the Union generalspresent were severally presented to General Lee.The much talked of surrendering of Lee's sword and my handing it back,this and much more that has been said about it is the purest romance.The word sword or side arms was not mentioned by either of us until Iwrote it in the terms.  There was no premeditation, and it did not occurto me until the moment I wrote it down.  If I had happened to omit it,and General Lee had called my attention to it, I should have put it inthe terms precisely as I acceded to the provision about the soldiersretaining their horses.General Lee, after all was completed and before taking his leave,remarked that his army was in a very bad condition for want of food, andthat they were without forage; that his men had been living for somedays on parched corn exclusively, and that he would have to ask me forrations and forage.  I told him 'certainly,' and asked for how many menhe wanted rations.  His answer was 'about twenty-five thousand;' and Iauthorized him to send his own commissary and quartermaster toAppomattox Station, two or three miles away, where he could have, out ofthe trains we had stopped, all the provisions wanted.  As for forage, wehad ourselves depended almost entirely upon the country for that.Generals Gibbon, Griffin and Merritt were designated by me to carry intoeffect the paroling of Lee's troops before they should start for theirhomes--General Lee leaving Generals Longstreet, Gordon and Pendleton forthem to confer with in order to facilitate this work.  Lee and I thenseparated as cordially as we had met, he returning to his own lines, andall went into bivouac for the night at Appomattox.Soon after Lee's departure I telegraphed to Washington as follows:HEADQUARTERS APPOMATTOX C. H., VA., April 9th, 1865, 4.30 P.M.HON. E. M. STANTON, Secretary of War, Washington.General Lee surrendered the Army of Northern Virginia this afternoon onterms proposed by myself.  The accompanying additional correspondencewill show the conditions fully.U. S. GRANT, Lieut.-General.When news of the surrender first reached our lines our men commencedfiring a salute of a hundred guns in honor of the victory.  I at oncesent word, however, to have it stopped.  The Confederates were now ourprisoners, and we did not want to exult over their downfall.I determined to return to Washington at once, with a view to putting astop to the purchase of supplies, and what I now deemed other uselessoutlay of money.  Before leaving, however, I thought I (*44) would liketo see General Lee again; so next morning I rode out beyond our linestowards his headquarters, preceded by a bugler and a staff-officercarrying a white flag.Lee soon mounted his horse, seeing who it was, and met me.  We had therebetween the lines, sitting on horseback, a very pleasant conversation ofover half an hour, in the course of which Lee said to me that the Southwas a big country and that we might have to march over it three or fourtimes before the war entirely ended, but that we would now be able to doit as they could no longer resist us.  He expressed it as his earnesthope, however, that we would not be called upon to cause more loss andsacrifice of life; but he could not foretell the result.  I thensuggested to General Lee that there was not a man in the Confederacywhose influence with the soldiery and the whole people was as great ashis, and that if he would now advise the surrender of all the armies Ihad no doubt his advice would be followed with alacrity.  But Lee said,that he could not do that without consulting the President first.  Iknew there was no use to urge him to do anything against his ideas ofwhat was right.I was accompanied by my staff and other officers, some of whom seemed tohave a great desire to go inside the Confederate lines.  They finallyasked permission of Lee to do so for the purpose of seeing some of theirold army friends, and the permission was granted.  They went over, had avery pleasant time with their old friends, and brought some of them backwith them when they returned.When Lee and I separated he went back to his lines and I returned to thehouse of Mr. McLean.  Here the officers of both armies came in greatnumbers, and seemed to enjoy the meeting as much as though they had beenfriends separated for a long time while fighting battles under the sameflag.  For the time being it looked very much as if all thought of thewar had escaped their minds.  After an hour pleasantly passed in thisway I set out on horseback, accompanied by my staff and a small escort,for Burkesville Junction, up to which point the railroad had by thistime been repaired.
ISFP	 LXVIII.MORALE OF THE TWO ARMIES--RELATIVE CONDITIONS OF THE NORTH AND SOUTH--PRESIDENT LINCOLN VISITS RICHMOND--ARRIVAL AT WASHINGTON--PRESIDENTLINCOLN'S ASSASSINATION--PRESIDENT JOHNSON'S POLICY.After the fall of Petersburg, and when the armies of the Potomac and theJames were in motion to head off Lee's army, the morale of the Nationaltroops had greatly improved.  There was no more straggling, no more rearguards.  The men who in former times had been falling back, were now, asI have already stated, striving to get to the front.  For the first timein four weary years they felt that they were now nearing the time whenthey could return to their homes with their country saved.  On the otherhand, the Confederates were more than correspondingly depressed.  Theirdespondency increased with each returning day, and especially after thebattle of Sailor's Creek.  They threw away their arms in constantlyincreasing numbers, dropping out of the ranks and betaking themselves tothe woods in the hope of reaching their homes.  I have already instancedthe case of the entire disintegration of a regiment whose colonel I metat Farmville.  As a result of these and other influences, when Leefinally surrendered at Appomattox, there were only 28,356 officers andmen left to be paroled, and many of these were without arms.  It wasprobably this latter fact which gave rise to the statement sometimesmade, North and South, that Lee surrendered a smaller number of men thanwhat the official figures show.  As a matter of official record, and inaddition to the number paroled as given above, we captured between March29th and the date of surrender 19,132 Confederates, to say nothing ofLee's other losses, killed, wounded and missing, during the series ofdesperate conflicts which marked his headlong and determined flight.The same record shows the number of cannon, including those atAppomattox, to have been 689 between the dates named.There has always been a great conflict of opinion as to the number oftroops engaged in every battle, or all important battles, fought betweenthe sections, the South magnifying the number of Union troops engagedand belittling their own. Northern writers have fallen, in manyinstances, into the same error.  I have often heard gentlemen, who werethoroughly loyal to the Union, speak of what a splendid fight the Southhad made and successfully continued for four years before yielding, withtheir twelve million of people against our twenty, and of the twelvefour being colored slaves, non-combatants.  I will add to theirargument.  We had many regiments of brave and loyal men who volunteeredunder great difficulty from the twelve million belonging to the South.But the South had rebelled against the National government.  It was notbound by any constitutional restrictions.  The whole South was amilitary camp.  The occupation of the colored people was to furnishsupplies for the army.  Conscription was resorted to early, and embracedevery male from the age of eighteen to forty-five, excluding only thosephysically unfit to serve in the field, and the necessary number ofcivil officers of State and intended National government.  The old andphysically disabled furnished a good portion of these.  The slaves, thenon-combatants, one-third of the whole, were required to work in thefield without regard to sex, and almost without regard to age.  Childrenfrom the age of eight years could and did handle the hoe; they were notmuch older when they began to hold the plough.  The four million ofcolored non-combatants were equal to more than three times their numberin the North, age for age and sex for sex, in supplying food from thesoil to support armies.  Women did not work in the fields in the North,and children attended school.The arts of peace were carried on in the North.  Towns and cities grewduring the war.  Inventions were made in all kinds of machinery toincrease the products of a day's labor in the shop, and in the field.In the South no opposition was allowed to the government which had beenset up and which would have become real and respected if the rebellionhad been successful.  No rear had to be protected.  All the troops inservice could be brought to the front to contest every inch of groundthreatened with invasion.  The press of the South, like the people whoremained at home, were loyal to the Southern cause.In the North, the country, the towns and the cities presented about thesame appearance they do in time of peace.  The furnace was in blast, theshops were filled with workmen, the fields were cultivated, not only tosupply the population of the North and the troops invading the South,but to ship abroad to pay a part of the expense of the war.  In theNorth the press was free up to the point of open treason.  The citizencould entertain his views and express them.  Troops were necessary inthe Northern States to prevent prisoners from the Southern army beingreleased by outside force, armed and set at large to destroy by fire ourNorthern cities.  Plans were formed by Northern and Southern citizens toburn our cities, to poison the water supplying them, to spread infectionby importing clothing from infected regions, to blow up our river andlake steamers--regardless of the destruction of innocent lives.  Thecopperhead disreputable portion of the press magnified rebel successes,and belittled those of the Union army.  It was, with a large following,an auxiliary to the Confederate army.  The North would have been muchstronger with a hundred thousand of these men in the Confederate ranksand the rest of their kind thoroughly subdued, as the Union sentimentwas in the South, than we were as the battle was fought.As I have said, the whole South was a military camp.  The coloredpeople, four million in number, were submissive, and worked in the fieldand took care of the families while the able-bodied white men were atthe front fighting for a cause destined to defeat.  The cause waspopular, and was enthusiastically supported by the young men.  Theconscription took all of them.  Before the war was over, furtherconscriptions took those between fourteen and eighteen years of age asjunior reserves, and those between forty-five and sixty as seniorreserves.  It would have been an offence, directly after the war, andperhaps it would be now, to ask any able-bodied man in the South, whowas between the ages of fourteen and sixty at any time during the war,whether he had been in the Confederate army.  He would assert that hehad, or account for his absence from the ranks.  Under suchcircumstances it is hard to conceive how the North showed such asuperiority of force in every battle fought.  I know they did not.During 1862 and '3, John H. Morgan, a partisan officer, of no militaryeducation, but possessed of courage and endurance, operated in the rearof the Army of the Ohio in Kentucky and Tennessee.  He had no base ofsupplies to protect, but was at home wherever he went.  The armyoperating against the South, on the contrary, had to protect its linesof communication with the North, from which all supplies had to come tothe front.  Every foot of road had to be guarded by troops stationed atconvenient distances apart.  These guards could not render assistancebeyond the points where stationed.  Morgan Was foot-loose and couldoperate where, his information--always correct--led him to believe hecould do the greatest damage.  During the time he was operating in thisway he killed, wounded and captured several times the number he ever hadunder his command at any one time.  He destroyed many millions ofproperty in addition. Places he did not attack had to be guarded as ifthreatened by him.  Forrest, an abler soldier, operated farther west,and held from the National front quite as many men as could be sparedfor offensive operations.  It is safe to say that more than half theNational army was engaged in guarding lines of supplies, or were onleave, sick in hospital or on detail which prevented their bearing arms.Then, again, large forces were employed where no Confederate armyconfronted them.  I deem it safe to say that there were no largeengagements where the National numbers compensated for the advantage ofposition and intrenchment occupied by the enemy.While I was in pursuit of General Lee, the President went to Richmond incompany with Admiral Porter, and on board his flagship.  He found thepeople of that city in great consternation.  The leading citizens amongthe people who had remained at home surrounded him, anxious thatsomething should be done to relieve them from suspense.  General Weitzelwas not then in the city, having taken offices in one of the neighboringvillages after his troops had succeeded in subduing the conflagrationwhich they had found in progress on entering the Confederate capital.The President sent for him, and, on his arrival, a short interview washad on board the vessel, Admiral Porter and a leading citizen ofVirginia being also present. After this interview the President wrote anorder in about these words, which I quote from memory:  'General Weitzelis authorized to permit the body calling itself the Legislature ofVirginia to meet for the purpose of recalling the Virginia troops fromthe Confederate armies.'Immediately some of the gentlemen composing that body wrote out a callfor a meeting and had it published in their papers.  This call, however,went very much further than Mr. Lincoln had contemplated, as he did notsay the 'Legislature of Virginia' but 'the body which called itself theLegislature of Virginia.' Mr. Stanton saw the call as published in theNorthern papers the very next issue and took the liberty ofcountermanding the order authorizing any meeting of the Legislature, orany other body, and this notwithstanding the fact that the President wasnearer the spot than he was.This was characteristic of Mr. Stanton.  He was a man who neverquestioned his own authority, and who always did in war time what hewanted to do.  He was an able constitutional lawyer and jurist; but theConstitution was not an impediment to him while the war lasted.  In thislatter particular I entirely agree with the view he evidently held.  TheConstitution was not framed with a view to any such rebellion as that of1861-5.  While it did not authorize rebellion it made no provisionagainst it.  Yet the right to resist or suppress rebellion is asinherent as the right of self-defence, and as natural as the right of anindividual to preserve his life when in jeopardy.  The Constitution wastherefore in abeyance for the time being, so far as it in any wayaffected the progress and termination of the war.Those in rebellion against the government of the United States were notrestricted by constitutional provisions, or any other, except the actsof their Congress, which was loyal and devoted to the cause for whichthe South was then fighting.  It would be a hard case when one-third ofa nation, united in rebellion against the national authority, isentirely untrammeled, that the other two-thirds, in their efforts tomaintain the Union intact, should be restrained by a Constitutionprepared by our ancestors for the express purpose of insuring thepermanency of the confederation of the States.After I left General Lee at Appomattox Station, I went with my staff anda few others directly to Burkesville Station on my way to Washington.The road from Burkesville back having been newly repaired and the groundbeing soft, the train got off the track frequently, and, as a result, itwas after midnight of the second day when I reached City Point.  As soonas possible I took a dispatch-boat thence to Washington City.While in Washington I was very busy for a time in preparing thenecessary orders for the new state of affairs; communicating with mydifferent commanders of separate departments, bodies of troops, etc.But by the 14th I was pretty well through with this work, so as to beable to visit my children, who were then in Burlington, New Jersey,attending school.  Mrs. Grant was with me in Washington at the time, andwe were invited by President and Mrs. Lincoln to accompany them to thetheatre on the evening of that day.  I replied to the President's verbalinvitation to the effect, that if we were in the city we would takegreat pleasure in accompanying them; but that I was very anxious to getaway and visit my children, and if I could get through my work duringthe day I should do so.  I did get through and started by the eveningtrain on the 14th, sending Mr. Lincoln word, of course, that I would notbe at the theatre.At that time the railroad to New York entered Philadelphia on BroadStreet; passengers were conveyed in ambulances to the Delaware River,and then ferried to Camden, at which point they took the cars again.When I reached the ferry, on the east side of the City of Philadelphia,I found people awaiting my arrival there; and also dispatches informingme of the assassination of the President and Mr. Seward, and of theprobable assassination of the Vice President, Mr. Johnson, andrequesting my immediate return.It would be impossible for me to describe the feeling that overcame meat the news of these assassinations, more especially the assassinationof the President.  I knew his goodness of heart, his generosity, hisyielding disposition, his desire to have everybody happy, and above allhis desire to see all the people of the United States enter again uponthe full privileges of citizenship with equality among all.  I knew alsothe feeling that Mr. Johnson had expressed in speeches and conversationagainst the Southern people, and I feared that his course towards themwould be such as to repel, and make them unwilling citizens; and if theybecame such they would remain so for a long while.  I felt thatreconstruction had been set back, no telling how far.I immediately arranged for getting a train to take me back to WashingtonCity; but Mrs. Grant was with me; it was after midnight and Burlingtonwas but an hour away.  Finding that I could accompany her to our houseand return about as soon as they would be ready to take me from thePhiladelphia station, I went up with her and returned immediately by thesame special train.  The joy that I had witnessed among the people inthe street and in public places in Washington when I left there, hadbeen turned to grief; the city was in reality a city of mourning.  Ihave stated what I believed then the effect of this would be, and myjudgment now is that I was right.  I believe the South would have beensaved from very much of the hardness of feeling that was engendered byMr. Johnson's course towards them during the first few months of hisadministration.  Be this as it may, Mr. Lincoln's assassination wasparticularly unfortunate for the entire nation.Mr. Johnson's course towards the South did engender bitterness offeeling.  His denunciations of treason and his ever-ready remark,'Treason is a crime and must be made odious,' was repeated to all thosemen of the South who came to him to get some assurances of safety sothat they might go to work at something with the feeling that what theyobtained would be secure to them.  He uttered his denunciations withgreat vehemence, and as they were accompanied with no assurances ofsafety, many Southerners were driven to a point almost beyond endurance.The President of the United States is, in a large degree, or ought tobe, a representative of the feeling, wishes and judgment of those overwhom he presides; and the Southerners who read the denunciations ofthemselves and their people must have come to the conclusion that heuttered the sentiments of the Northern people; whereas, as a matter offact, but for the assassination of Mr. Lincoln, I believe the greatmajority of the Northern people, and the soldiers unanimously, wouldhave been in favor of a speedy reconstruction on terms that would be theleast humiliating to the people who had rebelled against theirgovernment.  They believed, I have no doubt, as I did, that besidesbeing the mildest, it was also the wisest, policy.The people who had been in rebellion must necessarily come back into theUnion, and be incorporated as an integral part of the nation.  Naturallythe nearer they were placed to an equality with the people who had notrebelled, the more reconciled they would feel with their oldantagonists, and the better citizens they would be from the beginning.They surely would not make good citizens if they felt that they had ayoke around their necks.I do not believe that the majority of the Northern people at that timewere in favor of negro suffrage.  They supposed that it would naturallyfollow the freedom of the negro, but that there would be a time ofprobation, in which the ex-slaves could prepare themselves for theprivileges of citizenship before the full right would be conferred; butMr. Johnson, after a complete revolution of sentiment, seemed to regardthe South not only as an oppressed people, but as the people bestentitled to consideration of any of our citizens.  This was more thanthe people who had secured to us the perpetuation of the Union wereprepared for, and they became more radical in their views.  TheSoutherners had the most power in the executive branch, Mr. Johnsonhaving gone to their side; and with a compact South, and such sympathyand support as they could get from the North, they felt that they wouldbe able to control the nation at once, and already many of them acted asif they thought they were entitled to do so.Thus Mr. Johnson, fighting Congress on the one hand, and receiving thesupport of the South on the other, drove Congress, which wasoverwhelmingly republican, to the passing of first one measure and thenanother to restrict his power.  There being a solid South on one sidethat was in accord with the political party in the North which hadsympathized with the rebellion, it finally, in the judgment of Congressand of the majority of the legislatures of the States, became necessaryto enfranchise the negro, in all his ignorance.  In this work, I shallnot discuss the question of how far the policy of Congress in thisparticular proved a wise one.  It became an absolute necessity, however,because of the foolhardiness of the President and the blindness of theSouthern people to their own interest.  As to myself, while stronglyfavoring the course that would be the least humiliating to the peoplewho had been in rebellion, I gradually worked up to the point where,with the majority of the people, I favored immediate enfranchisement.
ISFP	 LXIX.SHERMAN AND JOHNSTON--JOHNSTON'S SURRENDER TO SHERMAN--CAPTURE OFMOBILE--WILSON'S EXPEDITION--CAPTURE OF JEFFERSON DAVIS--GENERALTHOMAS'S QUALITIES--ESTIMATE OF GENERAL CANBY.When I left Appomattox I ordered General Meade to proceed leisurely backto Burkesville Station with the Army of the Potomac and the Army of theJames, and to go into camp there until further orders from me.  GeneralJohnston, as has been stated before, was in North Carolina confrontingGeneral Sherman.  It could not be known positively, of course, whetherJohnston would surrender on the news of Lee's surrender, though Isupposed he would; and if he did not, Burkesville Station was thenatural point from which to move to attack him.  The army which I couldhave sent against him was superior to his, and that with which Shermanconfronted him was also superior; and between the two he wouldnecessarily have been crushed, or driven away.  With the loss of theircapital and the Army of Northern Virginia it was doubtful whetherJohnston's men would have the spirit to stand.  My belief was that hewould make no such attempt; but I adopted this course as a precautionagainst what might happen, however improbable.Simultaneously with my starting from City Point, I sent a messenger toNorth Carolina by boat with dispatches to General Sherman, informing himof the surrender of Lee and his army; also of the terms which I hadgiven him; and I authorized Sherman to give the same terms to Johnstonif the latter chose to accept them.  The country is familiar with theterms that Sherman agreed to CONDITIONALLY, because they embraced apolitical question as well as a military one and he would therefore haveto confer with the government before agreeing to them definitely.General Sherman had met Mr. Lincoln at City Point while visiting thereto confer with me about our final movement, and knew what Mr. Lincolnhad said to the peace commissioners when he met them at Hampton Roads,viz.:  that before he could enter into negotiations with them they wouldhave to agree to two points: one being that the Union should bepreserved, and the other that slavery should be abolished; and if theywere ready to concede these two points he was almost ready to sign hisname to a blank piece of paper and permit them to fill out the balanceof the terms upon which we would live together.  He had also seennotices in the newspapers of Mr. Lincoln's visit to Richmond, and hadread in the same papers that while there he had authorized the conveningof the Legislature of Virginia.Sherman thought, no doubt, in adding to the terms that I had made withgeneral Lee, that he was but carrying out the wishes of the President ofthe United States.  But seeing that he was going beyond his authority,he made it a point that the terms were only conditional.  They signedthem with this understanding, and agreed to a truce until the termscould be sent to Washington for approval; if approved by the properauthorities there, they would then be final; if not approved, then hewould give due notice, before resuming hostilities.  As the world knows,Sherman, from being one of the most popular generals of the land(Congress having even gone so far as to propose a bill providing for asecond lieutenant-general for the purpose of advancing him to thatgrade), was denounced by the President and Secretary of War in verybitter terms.  Some people went so far as to denounce him as a traitor--a most preposterous term to apply to a man who had rendered so muchservice as he had, even supposing he had made a mistake in granting suchterms as he did to Johnston and his army.  If Sherman had takenauthority to send Johnston with his army home, with their arms to be putin the arsenals of their own States, without submitting the question tothe authorities at Washington, the suspicions against him might havesome foundation.  But the feeling against Sherman died out very rapidly,and it was not many weeks before he was restored to the fullestconfidence of the American people.When, some days after my return to Washington, President Johnson and theSecretary of war received the terms which General Sherman had forwardedfor approval, a cabinet meeting was immediately called and I was sentfor.  There seemed to be the greatest consternation, lest Sherman wouldcommit the government to terms which they were not willing to accede toand which he had no right to grant.  A message went out directing thetroops in the South not to obey General Sherman.  I was ordered toproceed at once to North Carolina and take charge of matter theremyself. Of course I started without delay, and reached there as soon aspossible.  I repaired to Raleigh, where Sherman was, as quietly aspossible, hoping to see him without even his army learning of mypresence.When I arrived I went to Sherman's headquarters, and we were at oncecloseted together.  I showed him the instruction and orders under whichI visited him.  I told him that I wanted him to notify General Johnstonthat the terms which they had conditionally agreed upon had not beenapproved in Washington, and that he was authorized to offer the sameterms I had given General Lee.  I sent Sherman to do this himself.  Idid not wish the knowledge of my presence to be known to the armygenerally; so I left it to Sherman to negotiate the terms of thesurrender solely by himself, and without the enemy knowing that I wasanywhere near the field.  As soon as possible I started to get away, toleave Sherman quite free and untrammelled.At Goldsboro', on my way back, I met a mail, containing the lastnewspapers, and I found in them indications of great excitement in theNorth over the terms Sherman had given Johnston; and harsh orders thathad been promulgated by the President and Secretary of War.  I knew thatSherman must see these papers, and I fully realized what greatindignation they would cause him, though I do not think his feelingscould have been more excited than were my own.  But like the true andloyal soldier that he was, he carried out the instructions I had givenhim, obtained the surrender of Johnston's army, and settled down in hiscamp about Raleigh, to await final orders.There were still a few expeditions out in the South that could not becommunicated with, and had to be left to act according to the judgmentof their respective commanders.  With these it was impossible to tellhow the news of the surrender of Lee and Johnston, of which they musthave heard, might affect their judgment as to what was best to do.The three expeditions which I had tried so hard to get off from thecommands of Thomas and Canby did finally get off:  one under Canbyhimself, against Mobile, late in March; that under Stoneman from EastTennessee on the 20th; and the one under Wilson, starting from Eastport,Mississippi, on the 22d of March.  They were all eminently successful,but without any good result. Indeed much valuable property was destroyedand many lives lost at a time when we would have liked to spare them.The war was practically over before their victories were gained.  Theywere so late in commencing operations, that they did not hold any troopsaway that otherwise would have been operating against the armies whichwere gradually forcing the Confederate armies to a surrender.  The onlypossible good that we may have experienced from these raids was byStoneman's getting near Lynchburg about the time the armies of thePotomac and the James were closing in on Lee at Appomattox.Stoneman entered North Carolina and then pushed north to strike theVirginia and Tennessee Railroad.  He got upon that road, destroyed itsbridges at different places and rendered the road useless to the enemyup to within a few miles of Lynchburg.  His approach caused theevacuation of that city about the time we were at Appomattox, and wasthe cause of a commotion we heard of there.  He then pushed south, andwas operating in the rear of Johnston's army about the time thenegotiations were going on between Sherman and Johnston for the latter'ssurrender.  In this raid Stoneman captured and destroyed a large amountof stores, while fourteen guns and nearly two thousand prisoners werethe trophies of his success.Canby appeared before Mobile on the 27th of March.  The city of Mobilewas protected by two forts, besides other intrenchments--Spanish Fort,on the east side of the bay, and Fort Blakely, north of the city.  Theseforts were invested.  On the night of the 8th of April, the Nationaltroops having carried the enemy's works at one point, Spanish Fort wasevacuated; and on the 9th, the very day of Lee's surrender, Blakely wascarried by assault, with a considerable loss to us.  On the 11th thecity was evacuated.I had tried for more than two years to have an expedition sent againstMobile when its possession by us would have been of great advantage.  Itfinally cost lives to take it when its possession was of no importance,and when, if left alone, it would within a few days have fallen into ourhands without any bloodshed whatever.Wilson moved out with full 12,000 men, well equipped and well armed.  Hewas an energetic officer and accomplished his work rapidly.  Forrest wasin his front, but with neither his old-time army nor his old-timeprestige.  He now had principally conscripts.  His conscripts weregenerally old men and boys.  He had a few thousand regular cavalry left,but not enough to even retard materially the progress of Wilson'scavalry.  Selma fell on the 2d of April, with a large number ofprisoners and a large quantity of war material, machine shops, etc., tobe disposed of by the victors.  Tuscaloosa, Montgomery and West Pointfell in quick succession.  These were all important points to the enemyby reason of their railroad connections, as depots of supplies, andbecause of their manufactories of war material.  They were fortified orintrenched, and there was considerable fighting before they werecaptured.  Macon surrendered on the 21st of April.  Here news wasreceived of the negotiations for the surrender of Johnston's army.Wilson belonged to the military division commanded by Sherman, and ofcourse was bound by his terms.  This stopped all fighting.General Richard Taylor had now become the senior Confederate officerstill at liberty east of the Mississippi River, and on the 4th of May hesurrendered everything within the limits of this extensive command.General E. Kirby Smith surrendered the trans-Mississippi department onthe 26th of May, leaving no other Confederate army at liberty tocontinue the war.Wilson's raid resulted in the capture of the fugitive president of thedefunct confederacy before he got out of the country. This occurred atIrwinsville, Georgia, on the 11th of May.  For myself, and I believe Mr.Lincoln shared the feeling, I would have been very glad to have seen Mr.Davis succeed in escaping, but for one reason:  I feared that if notcaptured, he might get into the trans-Mississippi region and there setup a more contracted confederacy.  The young men now out of homes andout of employment might have rallied under his standard and protractedthe war yet another year.  The Northern people were tired of the war,they were tired of piling up a debt which would be a further mortgageupon their homes.Mr. Lincoln, I believe, wanted Mr. Davis to escape, because he did notwish to deal with the matter of his punishment.  He knew there would bepeople clamoring for the punishment of the ex-Confederate president, forhigh treason.  He thought blood enough had already been spilled to atonefor our wickedness as a nation.  At all events he did not wish to be thejudge to decide whether more should be shed or not.  But his own lifewas sacrificed at the hands of an assassin before the ex-president ofthe Confederacy was a prisoner in the hands of the government which hehad lent all his talent and all his energies to destroy.All things are said to be wisely directed, and for the best interest ofall concerned.  This reflection does not, however, abate in theslightest our sense of bereavement in the untimely loss of so good andgreat a man as Abraham Lincoln.He would have proven the best friend the South could have had, and savedmuch of the wrangling and bitterness of feeling brought out byreconstruction under a President who at first wished to revenge himselfupon Southern men of better social standing than himself, but who stillsought their recognition, and in a short time conceived the idea andadvanced the proposition to become their Moses to lead them triumphantlyout of all their difficulties.The story of the legislation enacted during the reconstruction period tostay the hands of the President is too fresh in the minds of the peopleto be told now.  Much of it, no doubt, was unconstitutional; but it washoped that the laws enacted would serve their purpose before thequestion of constitutionality could be submitted to the judiciary and adecision obtained. These laws did serve their purpose, and now remain 'adead letter' upon the statute books of the United States, no one takinginterest enough in them to give them a passing thought.Much was said at the time about the garb Mr. Davis was wearing when hewas captured.  I cannot settle this question from personal knowledge ofthe facts; but I have been under the belief, from information given tome by General Wilson shortly after the event, that when Mr. Davislearned that he was surrounded by our cavalry he was in his tent dressedin a gentleman's dressing gown.  Naturally enough, Mr. Davis wanted toescape, and would not reflect much how this should be accomplishedprovided it might be done successfully.  If captured, he would be noordinary prisoner.  He represented all there was of that hostility tothe government which had caused four years of the bloodiest war--and themost costly in other respects of which history makes any record.  Everyone supposed he would be tried for treason if captured, and that hewould be executed.  Had he succeeded in making his escape in anydisguise it would have been adjudged a good thing afterwards by hisadmirers.As my official letters on file in the War Department, as well as myremarks in this book, reflect upon General Thomas by dwelling somewhatupon his tardiness, it is due to myself, as well as to him, that I givemy estimate of him as a soldier.  The same remark will apply also in thecase of General Canby.  I had been at West Point with Thomas one year,and had known him later in the old army.  He was a man of commandingappearance, slow and deliberate in speech and action; sensible, honestand brave.  He possessed valuable soldierly qualities in an eminentdegree.  He gained the confidence of all who served under him, andalmost their love.  This implies a very valuable quality.  It is aquality which calls out the most efficient services of the troopsserving under the commander possessing it.Thomas's dispositions were deliberately made, and always good. He couldnot be driven from a point he was given to hold.  He was not as good,however, in pursuit as he was in action.  I do not believe that he couldever have conducted Sherman's army from Chattanooga to Atlanta againstthe defences and the commander guarding that line in 1864.  On the otherhand, if it had been given him to hold the line which Johnston tried tohold, neither that general nor Sherman, nor any other officer could havedone it better.Thomas was a valuable officer, who richly deserved, as he has received,the plaudits of his countrymen for the part he played in the greattragedy of 1861-5.General Canby was an officer of great merit.  He was naturally studious,and inclined to the law.  There have been in the army but very few, ifany, officers who took as much interest in reading and digesting everyact of Congress and every regulation for the government of the army ashe.  His knowledge gained in this way made him a most valuable staffofficer, a capacity in which almost all his army services were renderedup to the time of his being assigned to the Military Division of theGulf.  He was an exceedingly modest officer, though of great talent andlearning.  I presume his feelings when first called upon to command alarge army against a fortified city, were somewhat like my own whenmarching a regiment against General Thomas Harris in Missouri in 1861.Neither of us would have felt the slightest trepidation in going intobattle with some one else commanding.  Had Canby been in otherengagements afterwards, he would, I have no doubt, have advanced withoutany fear arising from a sense of the responsibility.  He was afterwardskilled in the lava beds of Southern Oregon, while in pursuit of thehostile Modoc Indians.  His character was as pure as his talent andlearning were great.  His services were valuable during the war, butprincipally as a bureau officer.  I have no idea that it was from choicethat his services were rendered in an office, but because of hissuperior efficiency there.
ISFP	 LXX.THE END OF THE WAR--THE MARCH TO WASHINGTON--ONE OF LINCOLN'S ANECDOTES--GRAND REVIEW AT WASHINGTON--CHARACTERISTICS OF LINCOLN AND STANTON--ESTIMATE OF THE DIFFERENT CORPS COMMANDERS.Things began to quiet down, and as the certainty that there would be nomore armed resistance became clearer, the troops in North Carolina andVirginia were ordered to march immediately to the capital, and go intocamp there until mustered out.  Suitable garrisons were left at theprominent places throughout the South to insure obedience to the lawsthat might be enacted for the government of the several States, and toinsure security to the lives and property of all classes.  I do not knowhow far this was necessary, but I deemed it necessary, at that time,that such a course should be pursued.  I think now that these garrisonswere continued after they ceased to be absolutely required; but it isnot to be expected that such a rebellion as was fought between thesections from 1861 to 1865 could terminate without leaving many seriousapprehensions in the mind of the people as to what should be done.Sherman marched his troops from Goldsboro, up to Manchester, on thesouth side of the James River, opposite Richmond, and there put them incamp, while he went back to Savannah to see what the situation wasthere.It was during this trip that the last outrage was committed upon him.Halleck had been sent to Richmond to command Virginia, and had issuedorders prohibiting even Sherman's own troops from obeying his,Sherman's, orders.  Sherman met the papers on his return, containingthis order of Halleck, and very justly felt indignant at the outrage.On his arrival at Fortress Monroe returning from Savannah, Shermanreceived an invitation from Halleck to come to Richmond and be hisguest.  This he indignantly refused, and informed Halleck, furthermore,that he had seen his order.  He also stated that he was coming up totake command of his troops, and as he marched through it would probablybe as well for Halleck not to show himself, because he (Sherman) wouldnot be responsible for what some rash person might do throughindignation for the treatment he had received.  Very soon after that,Sherman received orders from me to proceed to Washington City, and to gointo camp on the south side of the city pending the mustering-out of thetroops.There was no incident worth noting in the march northward fromGoldsboro, to Richmond, or in that from Richmond to Washington City.The army, however, commanded by Sherman, which had been engaged in allthe battles of the West and had marched from the Mississippi through theSouthern States to the sea, from there to Goldsboro, and thence toWashington City, had passed over many of the battle-fields of the Armyof the Potomac, thus having seen, to a greater extent than any otherbody of troops, the entire theatre of the four years' war for thepreservation of the Union.The march of Sherman's army from Atlanta to the sea and north toGoldsboro, while it was not accompanied with the danger that wasanticipated, yet was magnificent in its results, and equally magnificentin the way it was conducted.  It had an important bearing, in variousways, upon the great object we had in view, that of closing the war.All the States east of the Mississippi River up to the State of Georgia,had felt the hardships of the war.  Georgia, and South Carolina, andalmost all of North Carolina, up to this time, had been exempt frominvasion by the Northern armies, except upon their immediate sea coasts.Their newspapers had given such an account of Confederate success, thatthe people who remained at home had been convinced that the Yankees hadbeen whipped from first to last, and driven from pillar to post, andthat now they could hardly be holding out for any other purpose than tofind a way out of the war with honor to themselves.Even during this march of Sherman's the newspapers in his front wereproclaiming daily that his army was nothing better than a mob of men whowere frightened out of their wits and hastening, panic-stricken, to tryto get under the cover of our navy for protection against the Southernpeople.  As the army was seen marching on triumphantly, however, theminds of the people became disabused and they saw the true state ofaffairs.  In turn they became disheartened, and would have been glad tosubmit without compromise.Another great advantage resulting from this march, and which wascalculated to hasten the end, was the fact that the great storehouse ofGeorgia was entirely cut off from the Confederate armies.  As the troopsadvanced north from Savannah, the destruction of the railroads in SouthCarolina and the southern part of North Carolina, further cut off theirresources and left the armies still in Virginia and North Carolinadependent for supplies upon a very small area of country, already verymuch exhausted of food and forage.In due time the two armies, one from Burkesville Junction and the otherfrom the neighborhood of Raleigh, North Carolina, arrived and went intocamp near the Capital, as directed.  The troops were hardy, being inuredto fatigue, and they appeared in their respective camps as ready and fitfor duty as they had ever been in their lives.  I doubt whether an equalbody of men of any nation, take them man for man, officer for officer,was ever gotten together that would have proved their equal in a greatbattle.The armies of Europe are machines; the men are brave and the officerscapable; but the majority of the soldiers in most of the nations ofEurope are taken from a class of people who are not very intelligent andwho have very little interest in the contest in which they are calledupon to take part.  Our armies were composed of men who were able toread, men who knew what they were fighting for, and could not be inducedto serve as soldiers, except in an emergency when the safety of thenation was involved, and so necessarily must have been more than equalto men who fought merely because they were brave and because they werethoroughly drilled and inured to hardships.There was nothing of particular importance occurred during the timethese troops were in camp before starting North.I remember one little incident which I will relate as an anecdotecharacteristic of Mr. Lincoln.  It occurred a day after I reachedWashington, and about the time General Meade reached Burkesville withthe army.  Governor Smith of Virginia had left Richmond with theConfederate States government, and had gone to Danville.  Supposing Iwas necessarily with the army at Burkesville, he addressed a letter tome there informing me that, as governor of the Commonwealth of the Stateof Virginia, he had temporarily removed the State capital from Richmondto Danville, and asking if he would be permitted to perform thefunctions of his office there without molestation by the Federalauthorities.  I give this letter only in substance.  He also inquired ofme whether in case he was not allowed to perform the duties of hisoffice, he with a few others might not be permitted to leave the countryand go abroad without interference.  General Meade being informed that aflag of truce was outside his pickets with a letter to me, at once sentout and had the letter brought in without informing the officer whobrought it that I was not present.  He read the letter and telegraphedme its contents. Meeting Mr. Lincoln shortly after receiving thisdispatch, I repeated its contents to him.  Mr. Lincoln, supposing I wasasking for instructions, said, in reply to that part of Governor Smith'sletter which inquired whether he with a few friends would be permittedto leave the country unmolested, that his position was like that of acertain Irishman (giving the name) he knew in Springfield who was verypopular with the people, a man of considerable promise, and very muchliked.  Unfortunately he had acquired the habit of drinking, and hisfriends could see that the habit was growing on him.  These friendsdetermined to make an effort to save him, and to do this they drew up apledge to abstain from all alcoholic drinks.  They asked Pat to jointhem in signing the pledge, and he consented.  He had been so long outof the habit of using plain water as a beverage that he resorted tosoda-water as a substitute.  After a few days this began to growdistasteful to him.  So holding the glass behind him, he said:  'Doctor,couldn't you drop a bit of brandy in that unbeknownst to myself.'I do not remember what the instructions were the President gave me, butI know that Governor Smith was not permitted to perform the duties ofhis office.  I also know that if Mr. Lincoln had been spared, therewould have been no efforts made to prevent any one from leaving thecountry who desired to do so.  He would have been equally willing topermit the return of the same expatriated citizens after they had timeto repent of their choice.On the 18th of May orders were issued by the adjutant-general for agrand review by the President and his cabinet of Sherman's and Meade'sarmies.  The review commenced on the 23d and lasted two days.  Meade'sarmy occupied over six hours of the first day in passing the grand standwhich had been erected in front of the President's house.  Shermanwitnessed this review from the grand stand which was occupied by thePresident and his cabinet.  Here he showed his resentment for the crueland harsh treatment that had unnecessarily been inflicted upon him bythe Secretary of War, by refusing to take his extended hand.Sherman's troops had been in camp on the south side of the Potomac.During the night of the 23d he crossed over and bivouacked not far fromthe Capitol.  Promptly at ten o'clock on the morning of the 24th, histroops commenced to pass in review.  Sherman's army made a differentappearance from that of the Army of the Potomac.  The latter had beenoperating where they received directly from the North full supplies offood and clothing regularly:  the review of this army therefore was thereview of a body of 65,000 well-drilled, well-disciplined and orderlysoldiers inured to hardship and fit for any duty, but without theexperience of gathering their own food and supplies in an enemy'scountry, and of being ever on the watch. Sherman's army was not sowell-dressed as the Army of the Potomac, but their marching could notbe excelled; they gave the appearance of men who had been thoroughlydrilled to endure hardships, either by long and continuous marches orthrough exposure to any climate, without the ordinary shelter of a camp.They exhibited also some of the order of march through Georgia where the'sweet potatoes sprung up from the ground' as Sherman's army wentmarching through.  In the rear of a company there would be a capturedhorse or mule loaded with small cooking utensils, captured chickens andother food picked up for the use of the men.  Negro families who hadfollowed the army would sometimes come along in the rear of a company,with three or four children packed upon a single mule, and the motherleading it.The sight was varied and grand:  nearly all day for two successive days,from the Capitol to the Treasury Building, could be seen a mass oforderly soldiers marching in columns of companies.  The National flagwas flying from almost every house and store; the windows were filledwith spectators; the door-steps and side-walks were crowded with coloredpeople and poor whites who did not succeed in securing better quartersfrom which to get a view of the grand armies.  The city was about asfull of strangers who had come to see the sights as it usually is oninauguration day when a new President takes his seat.It may not be out of place to again allude to President Lincoln and theSecretary of War, Mr. Stanton, who were the great conspicuous figures inthe executive branch of the government. There is no great difference ofopinion now, in the public mind, as to the characteristics of thePresident.  With Mr. Stanton the case is different.  They were the veryopposite of each other in almost every particular, except that eachpossessed great ability.  Mr. Lincoln gained influence over men bymaking them feel that it was a pleasure to serve him.  He preferredyielding his own wish to gratify others, rather than to insist uponhaving his own way.  It distressed him to disappoint others.  In mattersof public duty, however, he had what he wished, but in the leastoffensive way.  Mr. Stanton never questioned his own authority tocommand, unless resisted.  He cared nothing for the feeling of others.In fact it seemed to be pleasanter to him to disappoint than to gratify.He felt no hesitation in assuming the functions of the executive, or inacting without advising with him.  If his act was not sustained, hewould change it--if he saw the matter would be followed up until he didso.It was generally supposed that these two officials formed the complementof each other.  The Secretary was required to prevent the President'sbeing imposed upon.  The President was required in the more responsibleplace of seeing that injustice was not done to others.  I do not knowthat this view of these two men is still entertained by the majority ofthe people.  It is not a correct view, however, in my estimation.  Mr.Lincoln did not require a guardian to aid him in the fulfilment of apublic trust.Mr. Lincoln was not timid, and he was willing to trust his generals inmaking and executing their plans.  The Secretary was very timid, and itwas impossible for him to avoid interfering with the armies covering thecapital when it was sought to defend it by an offensive movement againstthe army guarding the Confederate capital.  He could see our weakness,but he could not see that the enemy was in danger.  The enemy would nothave been in danger if Mr. Stanton had been in the field.  Thesecharacteristics of the two officials were clearly shown shortly afterEarly came so near getting into the capital.Among the army and corps commanders who served with me during the warbetween the States, and who attracted much public attention, but ofwhose ability as soldiers I have not yet given any estimate, are Meade,Hancock, Sedgwick, Burnside, Terry and Hooker.  There were others ofgreat merit, such as Griffin, Humphreys, Wright and Mackenzie.  Of thosefirst named, Burnside at one time had command of the Army of thePotomac, and later of the Army of the Ohio.  Hooker also commanded theArmy of the Potomac for a short time.General Meade was an officer of great merit, with drawbacks to hisusefulness that were beyond his control.  He had been an officer of theengineer corps before the war, and consequently had never served withtroops until he was over forty-six years of age.  He never had, Ibelieve, a command of less than a brigade.  He saw clearly anddistinctly the position of the enemy, and the topography of the countryin front of his own position.  His first idea was to take advantage ofthe lay of the ground, sometimes without reference to the direction wewanted to move afterwards.  He was subordinate to his superiors in rankto the extent that he could execute an order which changed his own planswith the same zeal he would have displayed if the plan had been his own.He was brave and conscientious, and commanded the respect of all whoknew him.  He was unfortunately of a temper that would get beyond hiscontrol, at times, and make him speak to officers of high rank in themost offensive manner.  No one saw this fault more plainly than hehimself, and no one regretted it more.  This made it unpleasant attimes, even in battle, for those around him to approach him even withinformation.  In spite of this defect he was a most valuable officer anddeserves a high place in the annals of his country.General Burnside was an officer who was generally liked and respected.He was not, however, fitted to command an army.  No one knew this betterthan himself.  He always admitted his blunders, and extenuated those ofofficers under him beyond what they were entitled to.  It was hardly hisfault that he was ever assigned to a separate command.Of Hooker I saw but little during the war.  I had known him very wellbefore, however.  Where I did see him, at Chattanooga, his achievementin bringing his command around the point of Lookout Mountain and intoChattanooga Valley was brilliant.  I nevertheless regarded him as adangerous man.  He was not subordinate to his superiors.  He wasambitious to the extent of caring nothing for the rights of others.  Hisdisposition was, when engaged in battle, to get detached from the mainbody of the army and exercise a separate command, gathering to hisstandard all he could of his juniors.Hancock stands the most conspicuous figure of all the general officerswho did not exercise a separate command.  He commanded a corps longerthan any other one, and his name was never mentioned as having committedin battle a blunder for which he was responsible.  He was a man of veryconspicuous personal appearance.  Tall, well-formed and, at the time ofwhich I now write, young and fresh-looking, he presented an appearancethat would attract the attention of an army as he passed.  His genialdisposition made him friends, and his personal courage and his presencewith his command in the thickest of the fight won for him the confidenceof troops serving under him.  No matter how hard the fight, the 2d corpsalways felt that their commander was looking after them.Sedgwick was killed at Spottsylvania before I had an opportunity offorming an estimate of his qualifications as a soldier from personalobservation.  I had known him in Mexico when both of us werelieutenants, and when our service gave no indication that either of uswould ever be equal to the command of a brigade. He stood very high inthe army, however, as an officer and a man. He was brave andconscientious.  His ambition was not great, and he seemed to dreadresponsibility.  He was willing to do any amount of battling, but alwayswanted some one else to direct. He declined the command of the Army ofthe Potomac once, if not oftener.General Alfred H. Terry came into the army as a volunteer without amilitary education.  His way was won without political influence up toan important separate command--the expedition against Fort Fisher, inJanuary, 1865.  His success there was most brilliant, and won for himthe rank of brigadier-general in the regular army and of major-generalof volunteers.  He is a man who makes friends of those under him by hisconsideration of their wants and their dues.  As a commander, he wontheir confidence by his coolness in action and by his clearness ofperception in taking in the situation under which he was placed at anygiven time.Griffin, Humphreys, and Mackenzie were good corps commanders, but cameinto that position so near to the close of the war as not to attractpublic attention.  All three served as such, in the last campaign of thearmies of the Potomac and the James, which culminated at AppomattoxCourt House, on the 9th of April, 1865.  The sudden collapse of therebellion monopolized attention to the exclusion of almost everythingelse.  I regarded Mackenzie as the most promising young officer in thearmy.  Graduating at West Point, as he did, during the second year ofthe war, he had won his way up to the command of a corps before itsclose.  This he did upon his own merit and without influence.CONCLUSION.The cause of the great War of the Rebellion against the United Statuswill have to be attributed to slavery.  For some years before the warbegan it was a trite saying among some politicians that 'A state halfslave and half free cannot exist.'  All must become slave or all free,or the state will go down.  I took no part myself in any such view ofthe case at the time, but since the war is over, reviewing the wholequestion, I have come to the conclusion that the saying is quite true.Slavery was an institution that required unusual guarantees for itssecurity wherever it existed; and in a country like ours where thelarger portion of it was free territory inhabited by an intelligent andwell-to-do population, the people would naturally have but littlesympathy with demands upon them for its protection.  Hence the people ofthe South were dependent upon keeping control of the general governmentto secure the perpetuation of their favorite institution.  They wereenabled to maintain this control long after the States where slaveryexisted had ceased to have the controlling power, through the assistancethey received from odd men here and there throughout the NorthernStates.  They saw their power waning, and this led them to encroach uponthe prerogatives and independence of the Northern States by enactingsuch laws as the Fugitive Slave Law.  By this law every Northern manwas obliged, when properly summoned, to turn out and help apprehendthe runaway slave of a Southern man.  Northern marshals becameslave-catchers, and Northern courts had to contribute to the supportand protection of the institution.This was a degradation which the North would not permit any longer thanuntil they could get the power to expunge such laws from the statutebooks.  Prior to the time of these encroachments the great majority ofthe people of the North had no particular quarrel with slavery, so longas they were not forced to have it themselves.  But they were notwilling to play the role of police for the South in the protection ofthis particular institution.In the early days of the country, before we had railroads, telegraphsand steamboats--in a word, rapid transit of any sort--the States wereeach almost a separate nationality.  At that time the subject of slaverycaused but little or no disturbance to the public mind.  But the countrygrew, rapid transit was established, and trade and commerce between theStates got to be so much greater than before, that the power of theNational government became more felt and recognized and, therefore, hadto be enlisted in the cause of this institution.It is probably well that we had the war when we did.  We are better offnow than we would have been without it, and have made more rapidprogress than we otherwise should have made.  The civilized nations ofEurope have been stimulated into unusual activity, so that commerce,trade, travel, and thorough acquaintance among people of differentnationalities, has become common; whereas, before, it was but the fewwho had ever had the privilege of going beyond the limits of their owncountry or who knew anything about other people.  Then, too, ourrepublican institutions were regarded as experiments up to the breakingout of the rebellion, and monarchical Europe generally believed that ourrepublic was a rope of sand that would part the moment the slighteststrain was brought upon it.  Now it has shown itself capable of dealingwith one of the greatest wars that was ever made, and our people haveproven themselves to be the most formidable in war of any nationality.But this war was a fearful lesson, and should teach us the necessity ofavoiding wars in the future.The conduct of some of the European states during our troubles shows thelack of conscience of communities where the responsibility does not comeupon a single individual.  Seeing a nation that extended from ocean toocean, embracing the better part of a continent, growing as we weregrowing in population, wealth and intelligence, the European nationsthought it would be well to give us a check.  We might, possibly, aftera while threaten their peace, or, at least, the perpetuity of theirinstitutions.  Hence, England was constantly finding fault with theadministration at Washington because we were not able to keep up aneffective blockade.  She also joined, at first, with France and Spain insetting up an Austrian prince upon the throne in Mexico, totallydisregarding any rights or claims that Mexico had of being treated as anindependent power.  It is true they trumped up grievances as a pretext,but they were only pretexts which can always be found when wanted.Mexico, in her various revolutions, had been unable to give thatprotection to the subjects of foreign nations which she would have likedto give, and some of her revolutionary leaders had forced loans fromthem.  Under pretence of protecting their citizens, these nations seizedupon Mexico as a foothold for establishing a European monarchy upon ourcontinent, thus threatening our peace at home.  I, myself, regarded thisas a direct act of war against the United States by the powers engaged,and supposed as a matter of course that the United States would treat itas such when their hands were free to strike.  I often spoke of thematter to Mr. Lincoln and the Secretary of War, but never heard anyspecial views from them to enable me to judge what they thought or feltabout it.  I inferred that they felt a good deal as I did, but wereunwilling to commit themselves while we had our own troubles upon ourhands.All of the powers except France very soon withdrew from the armedintervention for the establishment of an Austrian prince upon the throneof Mexico; but the governing people of these countries continued to theclose of the war to throw obstacles in our way.  After the surrender ofLee, therefore, entertaining the opinion here expressed, I sent Sheridanwith a corps to the Rio Grande to have him where he might aid Juarez inexpelling the French from Mexico.  These troops got off before theycould be stopped; and went to the Rio Grande, where Sheridan distributedthem up and down the river, much to the consternation of the troops inthe quarter of Mexico bordering on that stream.  This soon led to arequest from France that we should withdraw our troops from the RioGrande and to negotiations for the withdrawal of theirs.  FinallyBazaine was withdrawn from Mexico by order of the French Government.From that day the empire began to totter.  Mexico was then able tomaintain her independence without aid from us.France is the traditional ally and friend of the United States.  I didnot blame France for her part in the scheme to erect a monarchy upon theruins of the Mexican Republic.  That was the scheme of one man, animitator without genius or merit.  He had succeeded in stealing thegovernment of his country, and made a change in its form against thewishes and instincts of his people.  He tried to play the part of thefirst Napoleon, without the ability to sustain that role.  He sought bynew conquests to add to his empire and his glory; but the signal failureof his scheme of conquest was the precursor of his own overthrow.Like our own war between the States, the Franco-Prussian war was anexpensive one; but it was worth to France all it cost her people.  Itwas the completion of the downfall of Napoleon III.  The beginning waswhen he landed troops on this continent.  Failing here, the prestige ofhis name--all the prestige he ever had--was gone.  He must achieve asuccess or fall.  He tried to strike down his neighbor, Prussia--andfell.I never admired the character of the first Napoleon; but I recognize hisgreat genius.  His work, too, has left its impress for good on the faceof Europe.  The third Napoleon could have no claim to having done a goodor just act.To maintain peace in the future it is necessary to be prepared for war.There can scarcely be a possible chance of a conflict, such as the lastone, occurring among our own people again; but, growing as we are, inpopulation, wealth and military power, we may become the envy of nationswhich led us in all these particulars only a few years ago; and unlesswe are prepared for it we may be in danger of a combined movement beingsome day made to crush us out.  Now, scarcely twenty years after thewar, we seem to have forgotten the lessons it taught, and are going onas if in the greatest security, without the power to resist an invasionby the fleets of fourth-rate European powers for a time until we couldprepare for them.We should have a good navy, and our sea-coast defences should be put inthe finest possible condition.  Neither of these cost much when it isconsidered where the money goes, and what we get in return.  Moneyexpended in a fine navy, not only adds to our security and tends toprevent war in the future, but is very material aid to our commerce withforeign nations in the meantime.  Money spent upon sea-coast defences isspent among our own people, and all goes back again among the people.The work accomplished, too, like that of the navy, gives us a feeling ofsecurity.England's course towards the United States during the rebellionexasperated the people of this country very much against the mothercountry.  I regretted it.  England and the United States are naturalallies, and should be the best of friends.  They speak one language, andare related by blood and other ties.  We together, or even eitherseparately, are better qualified than any other people to establishcommerce between all the nationalities of the world.England governs her own colonies, and particularly those embracingthe people of different races from her own, better than any othernation.  She is just to the conquered, but rigid.  She makes themself-supporting, but gives the benefit of labor to the laborer.  Shedoes not seem to look upon the colonies as outside possessions which sheis at liberty to work for the support and aggrandizement of the homegovernment.The hostility of England to the United States during our rebellion wasnot so much real as it was apparent.  It was the hostility of theleaders of one political party.  I am told that there was no time duringthe civil war when they were able to get up in England a demonstrationin favor of secession, while these were constantly being gotten up infavor of the Union, or, as they called it, in favor of the North.  Evenin Manchester, which suffered so fearfully by having the cotton cut offfrom her mills, they had a monster demonstration in favor of the Northat the very time when their workmen were almost famishing.It is possible that the question of a conflict between races may come upin the future, as did that between freedom and slavery before.  Thecondition of the colored man within our borders may become a source ofanxiety, to say the least.  But he was brought to our shores bycompulsion, and he now should be considered as having as good a right toremain here as any other class of our citizens.  It was looking to asettlement of this question that led me to urge the annexation of SantoDomingo during the time I was President of the United States.Santo Domingo was freely offered to us, not only by the administration,but by all the people, almost without price. The island is upon ourshores, is very fertile, and is capable of supporting fifteen millionsof people.  The products of the soil are so valuable that labor in herfields would be so compensated as to enable those who wished to go thereto quickly repay the cost of their passage.  I took it that the coloredpeople would go there in great numbers, so as to have independent statesgoverned by their own race.  They would still be States of the Union,and under the protection of the General Government; but the citizenswould be almost wholly colored.By the war with Mexico, we had acquired, as we have seen, territoryalmost equal in extent to that we already possessed. It was seen thatthe volunteers of the Mexican war largely composed the pioneers tosettle up the Pacific coast country. Their numbers, however, werescarcely sufficient to be a nucleus for the population of the importantpoints of the territory acquired by that war.  After our rebellion, whenso many young men were at liberty to return to their homes, they foundthey were not satisfied with the farm, the store, or the work-shop ofthe villages, but wanted larger fields.  The mines of the mountainsfirst attracted them; but afterwards they found that rich valleys andproductive grazing and farming lands were there.  This territory, thegeography of which was not known to us at the close of the rebellion, isnow as well mapped as any portion of our country.  Railroads traverse itin every direction, north, south, east, and west.  The mines are worked.The high lands are used for grazing purposes, and rich agriculturallands are found in many of the valleys.  This is the work of thevolunteer.  It is probable that the Indians would have had control ofthese lands for a century yet but for the war.  We must conclude,therefore, that wars are not always evils unmixed with some good.Prior to the rebellion the great mass of the people were satisfied toremain near the scenes of their birth.  In fact an immense majority ofthe whole people did not feel secure against coming to want should theymove among entire strangers.  So much was the country divided into smallcommunities that localized idioms had grown up, so that you could almosttell what section a person was from by hearing him speak.  Before, newterritories were settled by a 'class'; people who shunned contact withothers; people who, when the country began to settle up around them,would push out farther from civilization.  Their guns furnished meat,and the cultivation of a very limited amount of the soil, their breadand vegetables.  All the streams abounded with fish.  Trapping wouldfurnish pelts to be brought into the States once a year, to pay fornecessary articles which they could not raise--powder, lead, whiskey,tobacco and some store goods.  Occasionally some little articles ofluxury would enter into these purchases--a quarter of a pound of tea,two or three pounds of coffee, more of sugar, some playing cards, and ifanything was left over of the proceeds of the sale, more whiskey.Little was known of the topography of the country beyond the settlementsof these frontiersmen.  This is all changed now. The war begot a spiritof independence and enterprise.  The feeling now is, that a youth mustcut loose from his old surroundings to enable him to get up in theworld.  There is now such a commingling of the people that particularidioms and pronunciation are no longer localized to any great extent;the country has filled up 'from the centre all around to the sea';railroads connect the two oceans and all parts of the interior; maps,nearly perfect, of every part of the country are now furnished thestudent of geography.The war has made us a nation of great power and intelligence. We havebut little to do to preserve peace, happiness and prosperity at home,and the respect of other nations.  Our experience ought to teach us thenecessity of the first; our power secures the latter.I feel that we are on the eve of a new era, when there is to be greatharmony between the Federal and Confederate.  I cannot stay to be aliving witness to the correctness of this prophecy; but I feel it withinme that it is to be so.  The universally kind feeling expressed for meat a time when it was supposed that each day would prove my last, seemedto me the beginning of the answer to 'Let us have peace.'The expression of these kindly feelings were not restricted to a sectionof the country, nor to a division of the people.  They came fromindividual citizens of all nationalities; from all denominations--theProtestant, the Catholic, and the Jew; and from the various societies ofthe land--scientific, educational, religious or otherwise.  Politics didnot enter into the matter at all.I am not egotist enough to suppose all this significance should be givenbecause I was the object of it.  But the war between the States was avery bloody and a very costly war.  One side or the other had to yieldprinciples they deemed dearer than life before it could be brought to anend.  I commanded the whole of the mighty host engaged on the victoriousside.  I was, no matter whether deservedly so or not, a representativeof that side of the controversy.  It is a significant and gratifyingfact that Confederates should have joined heartily in this spontaneousmove.  I hope the good feeling inaugurated may continue to the end.APPENDIX.REPORT OF LIEUTENANT-GENERAL U. S. GRANT, OF THE UNITED STATES ARMIES1864-65.HEADQUARTERS ARMIES OF THE UNITED STATES, WASHINGTON, D. C., July 22,1865.HON. E. M. STANTON, Secretary of War.SIR:  I have the honor to submit the following report of the operationsof the Armies of the United States from the date of my appointment tocommand the same.From an early period in the rebellion I had been impressed with the ideathat active and continuous operations of all the troops that could bebrought into the field, regardless of season and weather, were necessaryto a speedy termination of the war.  The resources of the enemy and hisnumerical strength were far inferior to ours; but as an offset to this,we had a vast territory, with a population hostile to the government, togarrison, and long lines of river and railroad communications toprotect, to enable us to supply the operating armies.The armies in the East and West acted independently and without concert,like a balky team, no two ever pulling together, enabling the enemy touse to great advantage his interior lines of communication fortransporting troops from East to West, reinforcing the army mostvigorously pressed, and to furlough large numbers, during seasons ofinactivity on our part, to go to their homes and do the work ofproducing, for the support of their armies.  It was a question whetherour numerical strength and resources were not more than balanced bythese disadvantages and the enemy's superior position.From the first, I was firm in the conviction that no peace could be hadthat would be stable and conducive to the happiness of the people, bothNorth and South, until the military power of the rebellion was entirelybroken.I therefore determined, first, to use the greatest number of troopspracticable against the armed force of the enemy; preventing him fromusing the same force at different seasons against first one and thenanother of our armies, and the possibility of repose for refitting andproducing necessary supplies for carrying on resistance.  Second, tohammer continuously against the armed force of the enemy and hisresources, until by mere attrition, if in no other way, there should benothing left to him but an equal submission with the loyal section ofour common country to the constitution and laws of the land.These views have been kept constantly in mind, and orders given andcampaigns made to carry them out.  Whether they might have been betterin conception and execution is for the people, who mourn the loss offriends fallen, and who have to pay the pecuniary cost, to say.  All Ican say is, that what I have done has been done conscientiously, to thebest of my ability, and in what I conceived to be for the best interestsof the whole country.At the date when this report begins, the situation of the contendingforces was about as follows:  The Mississippi River was stronglygarrisoned by Federal troops, from St.  Louis, Missouri, to its mouth.The line of the Arkansas was also held, thus giving us armed possessionof all west of the Mississippi, north of that stream.  A few points inSouthern Louisiana, not remote from the river, were held by us, togetherwith a small garrison at and near the mouth of the Rio Grande.  All thebalance of the vast territory of Arkansas, Louisiana, and Texas was inthe almost undisputed possession of the enemy, with an army of probablynot less than eighty thousand effective men, that could have beenbrought into the field had there been sufficient opposition to havebrought them out.  The let-alone policy had demoralized this force sothat probably but little more than one-half of it was ever present ingarrison at any one time.  But the one-half, or forty thousand men, withthe bands of guerillas scattered through Missouri, Arkansas, and alongthe Mississippi River, and the disloyal character of much of thepopulation, compelled the use of a large number of troops to keepnavigation open on the river, and to protect the loyal people to thewest of it.  To the east of the Mississippi we held substantially withthe line of the Tennessee and Holston rivers, running eastward toinclude nearly all of the State of Tennessee.  South of Chattanooga, asmall foothold had been obtained in Georgia, sufficient to protect EastTennessee from incursions from the enemy's force at Dalton, Georgia.West Virginia was substantially within our lines.  Virginia, with theexception of the northern border, the Potomac River, a small area aboutthe mouth of James River, covered by the troops at Norfolk and FortMonroe, and the territory covered by the Army of the Potomac lying alongthe Rapidan, was in the possession of the enemy.  Along the sea-coastfootholds had been obtained at Plymouth, Washington, and New Bern, inNorth Carolina; Beaufort, Folly and Morris Islands, Hilton Head, FortPulaski, and Port Royal, in South Carolina; Fernandina and St.Augustine, in Florida. Key West and Pensacola were also in ourpossession, while all the important ports were blockaded by the navy.The accompanying map, a copy of which was sent to General Sherman andother commanders in March, 1864, shows by red lines the territoryoccupied by us at the beginning of the rebellion, and at the opening ofthe campaign of 1864, while those in blue are the lines which it wasproposed to occupy.Behind the Union lines there were many bands of guerillas and a largepopulation disloyal to the government, making it necessary to guardevery foot of road or river used in supplying our armies.  In the South,a reign of military despotism prevailed, which made every man and boycapable of bearing arms a soldier; and those who could not bear arms inthe field acted as provosts for collecting deserters and returning them.This enabled the enemy to bring almost his entire strength into thefield.The enemy had concentrated the bulk of his forces east of theMississippi into two armies, commanded by Generals R. E. Lee and J. E.Johnston, his ablest and best generals.  The army commanded by Leeoccupied the south bank of the Rapidan, extending from Mine Runwestward, strongly intrenched, covering and defending Richmond, therebel capital, against the Army of the Potomac. The army under Johnstonoccupied a strongly intrenched position at Dalton, Georgia, covering anddefending Atlanta, Georgia, a place of great importance as a railroadcentre, against the armies under Major-General W. T. Sherman.  Inaddition to these armies he had a large cavalry force under Forrest, inNorth-east Mississippi; a considerable force, of all arms, in theShenandoah Valley, and in the western part of Virginia and extremeeastern part of Tennessee; and also confronting our sea-coast garrisons,and holding blockaded ports where we had no foothold upon land.These two armies, and the cities covered and defended by them, were themain objective points of the campaign.Major-General W. T. Sherman, who was appointed to the command of theMilitary Division of the Mississippi, embracing all the armies andterritory east of the Mississippi River to the Alleghanies and theDepartment of Arkansas, west of the Mississippi, had the immediatecommand of the armies operating against Johnston.Major-General George G. Meade had the immediate command of the Army ofthe Potomac, from where I exercised general supervision of the movementsof all our armies.General Sherman was instructed to move against Johnston's army, to breakit up, and to go into the interior of the enemy's country as far as hecould, inflicting all the damage he could upon their war resources.  Ifthe enemy in his front showed signs of joining Lee, to follow him up tothe full extent of his ability, while I would prevent the concentrationof Lee upon him, if it was in the power of the Army of the Potomac to doso.  More specific written instructions were not given, for the reasonthat I had talked over with him the plans of the campaign, and wassatisfied that he understood them and would execute them to the fullestextent possible.Major-General N. P. Banks, then on an expedition up Red River againstShreveport, Louisiana (which had been organized previous to myappointment to command), was notified by me on the 15th of March, of theimportance it was that Shreveport should be taken at the earliestpossible day, and that if he found that the taking of it would occupyfrom ten to fifteen days' more time than General Sherman had given histroops to be absent from their command, he would send them back at thetime specified by General Sherman, even if it led to the abandonment ofthe main object of the Red River expedition, for this force wasnecessary to movements east of the Mississippi; that should hisexpedition prove successful, he would hold Shreveport and the Red Riverwith such force as he might deem necessary, and return the balance ofhis troops to the neighborhood of New Orleans, commencing no move forthe further acquisition of territory, unless it was to make that thenheld by him more easily held; that it might be a part of the springcampaign to move against Mobile; that it certainly would be, if troopsenough could be obtained to make it without embarrassing othermovements; that New Orleans would be the point of departure for such anexpedition; also, that I had directed General Steele to make a real movefrom Arkansas, as suggested by him (General Banks), instead of ademonstration, as Steele thought advisable.On the 31st of March, in addition to the foregoing notification anddirections, he was instructed as follows:'1st.  If successful in your expedition against Shreveport, that youturn over the defence of the Red River to General Steele and the navy.'2d.  That you abandon Texas entirely, with the exception of your holdupon the Rio Grande.  This can be held with four thousand men, if theywill turn their attention immediately to fortifying their positions.  Atleast one-half of the force required for this service might be takenfrom the colored troops.'3d.  By properly fortifying on the Mississippi River, the force toguard it from Port Hudson to New Orleans can be reduced to ten thousandmen, if not to a less number.  Six thousand more would then hold all therest of the territory necessary to hold until active operations canagain be resumed west of the river. According to your last return, thiswould give you a force of over thirty thousand effective men with whichto move against Mobile.  To this I expect to add five thousand men fromMissouri.  If however, you think the force here stated too small to holdthe territory regarded as necessary to hold possession of, I would sayconcentrate at least twenty-five thousand men of your present commandfor operations against Mobile.  With these and such additions as I cangive you from elsewhere, lose no time in making a demonstration, to befollowed by an attack upon Mobile.  Two or more iron-clads will beordered to report to Admiral Farragut.  This gives him a strong navalfleet with which to co-operate.  You can make your own arrangements withthe admiral for his co-operation, and select your own line of approach.My own idea of the matter is that Pascagoula should be your base; but,from your long service in the Gulf Department, you will know best aboutthe matter.  It is intended that your movements shall be co-operativewith movements elsewhere, and you cannot now start too soon.  All Iwould now add is, that you commence the concentration of your forces atonce.  Preserve a profound secrecy of what you intend doing, and startat the earliest possible moment.'U. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General.'MAJOR-GENERAL N. P. BANKS.'Major-General Meade was instructed that Lee's army would be hisobjective point; that wherever Lee went he would go also.  For hismovement two plans presented themselves:  One to cross the Rapidan belowLee, moving by his right flank; the other above, moving by his left.Each presented advantages over the other, with corresponding objections.By crossing above, Lee would be cut off from all chance of ignoringRichmond or going north on a raid.  But if we took this route, all wedid would have to be done whilst the rations we started with held out;besides, it separated us from Butler, so that he could not be directedhow to cooperate.  If we took the other route, Brandy Station could beused as a base of supplies until another was secured on the York orJames rivers.  Of these, however, it was decided to take the lowerroute.The following letter of instruction was addressed to Major-General B. F.Butler:'FORT MONROE, VIRGINIA, April 2, 1864.'GENERAL:-In the spring campaign, which it is desirable shall commenceat as early a day as practicable, it is proposed to have cooperativeaction of all the armies in the field, as far as this object can beaccomplished.'It will not be possible to unite our armies into two or three largeones to act as so many units, owing to the absolute necessity of holdingon to the territory already taken from the enemy.  But, generallyspeaking, concentration can be practically effected by armies moving tothe interior of the enemy's country from the territory they have toguard.  By such movement, they interpose themselves between the enemyand the country to be guarded, thereby reducing the number necessary toguard important points, or at least occupy the attention of a part ofthe enemy's force, if no greater object is gained. Lee's army andRichmond being the greater objects towards which our attention must bedirected in the next campaign, it is desirable to unite all the force wecan against them.  The necessity of covering Washington with the Army ofthe Potomac, and of covering your department with your army, makes itimpossible to unite these forces at the beginning of any move. Ipropose, therefore, what comes nearest this of anything that seemspracticable:  The Army of the Potomac will act from its present base,Lee's army being the objective point.  You will collect all the forcesfrom your command that can be spared from garrison duty--I should saynot less than twenty thousand effective men--to operate on the southside of James River, Richmond being your objective point.  To the forceyou already have will be added about ten thousand men from SouthCarolina, under Major-General Gillmore, who will command them in person.Major-General W. F. Smith is ordered to report to you, to command thetroops sent into the field from your own department.'General Gillmore will be ordered to report to you at Fortress Monroe,with all the troops on transports, by the 18th instant, or as soonthereafter as practicable.  Should you not receive notice by that timeto move, you will make such disposition of them and your other forces asyou may deem best calculated to deceive the enemy as to the real move tobe made.'When you are notified to move, take City Point with as much force aspossible.  Fortify, or rather intrench, at once, and concentrate allyour troops for the field there as rapidly as you can.  From City Pointdirections cannot be given at this time for your further movements.'The fact that has already been stated--that is, that Richmond is to beyour objective point, and that there is to be co-operation between yourforce and the Army of the Potomac--must be your guide.  This indicatesthe necessity of your holding close to the south bank of the James Riveras you advance.  Then, should the enemy be forced into his intrenchmentsin Richmond, the Army of the Potomac would follow, and by means oftransports the two armies would become a unit.'All the minor details of your advance are left entirely to yourdirection. If, however, you think it practicable to use your cavalrysouth of you, so as to cut the railroad about Hicksford, about the timeof the general advance, it would be of immense advantage.'You will please forward for my information, at the earliest practicableday, all orders, details, and instructions you may give for theexecution of this order.'U. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General.'MAJOR-GENERAL B. F. BUTLER.'On the 16th these instructions were substantially reiterated. On the19th, in order to secure full co-operation between his army and that ofGeneral Meade, he was informed that I expected him to move from FortMonroe the same day that General Meade moved from Culpeper.  The exacttime I was to telegraph him as soon as it was fixed, and that it wouldnot be earlier than the 27th of April; that it was my intention to fightLee between Culpeper and Richmond, if he would stand.  Should he,however, fall back into Richmond, I would follow up and make a junctionwith his (General Butler's) army on the James River; that, could I becertain he would be able to invest Richmond on the south side, so as tohave his left resting on the James, above the city, I would form thejunction there; that circumstances might make this course advisableanyhow; that he should use every exertion to secure footing as far upthe south side of the river as he could, and as soon as possible afterthe receipt of orders to move; that if he could not carry the city, heshould at least detain as large a force there as possible.In co-operation with the main movements against Lee and Johnston, I wasdesirous of using all other troops necessarily kept in departmentsremote from the fields of immediate operations, and also those kept inthe background for the protection of our extended lines between theloyal States and the armies operating against them.A very considerable force, under command of Major-General Sigel, was soheld for the protection of West Virginia, and the frontiers of Marylandand Pennsylvania.  Whilst these troops could not be withdrawn to distantfields without exposing the North to invasion by comparatively smallbodies of the enemy, they could act directly to their front, and givebetter protection than if lying idle in garrison.  By such a movementthey would either compel the enemy to detach largely for the protectionof his supplies and lines of communication, or he would lose them.General Sigel was therefore directed to organize all his available forceinto two expeditions, to move from Beverly and Charleston, under commandof Generals Ord and Crook, against the East Tennessee and VirginiaRailroad. Subsequently, General Ord having been relieved at his ownrequest, General Sigel was instructed at his own suggestion, to give upthe expedition by Beverly, and to form two columns, one under GeneralCrook, on the Kanawha, numbering about ten thousand men, and one on theShenandoah, numbering about seven thousand men.  The one on theShenandoah to assemble between Cumberland and the Shenandoah, and theinfantry and artillery advanced to Cedar Creek with such cavalry ascould be made available at the moment, to threaten the enemy in theShenandoah Valley, and advance as far as possible; while General Crookwould take possession of Lewisburg with part of his force and move downthe Tennessee Railroad, doing as much damage as he could, destroying theNew River Bridge and the salt-works, at Saltville, Va.Owing to the weather and bad condition of the roads, operations weredelayed until the 1st of May, when, everything being in readiness andthe roads favorable, orders were given for a general movement of all thearmies not later than the 4th of May.My first object being to break the military power of the rebellion, andcapture the enemy's important strongholds, made me desirous that GeneralButler should succeed in his movement against Richmond, as that wouldtend more than anything else, unless it were the capture of Lee's army,to accomplish this desired result in the East. If he failed, it was mydetermination, by hard fighting, either to compel Lee to retreat, or toso cripple him that he could not detach a large force to go north, andstill retain enough for the defence of Richmond.  It was wellunderstood, by both Generals Butler and Meade, before starting on thecampaign, that it was my intention to put both their armies south of theJames River, in case of failure to destroy Lee without it.Before giving General Butler his instructions, I visited him at FortMonroe, and in conversation pointed out the apparent importance ofgetting possession of Petersburg, and destroying railroad communicationas far south as possible.  Believing, however, in the practicability ofcapturing Richmond unless it was reinforced, I made that the objectivepoint of his operations.  As the Army of the Potomac was to movesimultaneously with him, Lee could not detach from his army with safety,and the enemy did not have troops elsewhere to bring to the defence ofthe city in time to meet a rapid movement from the north of James River.I may here state that, commanding all the armies as I did, I tried, asfar as possible, to leave General Meade in independent command of theArmy of the Potomac.  My instructions for that army were all throughhim, and were general in their nature, leaving all the details and theexecution to him.  The campaigns that followed proved him to be theright man in the right place.  His commanding always in the presence ofan officer superior to him in rank, has drawn from him much of thatpublic attention that his zeal and ability entitle him to, and which hewould otherwise have received.The movement of the Army of the Potomac commenced early on the morningof the 4th of May, under the immediate direction and orders ofMajor-General Meade, pursuant to instructions.  Before night, the wholearmy was across the Rapidan (the fifth and sixth corps crossing atGermania Ford, and the second corps at Ely's Ford, the cavalry, underMajor-General Sheridan, moving in advance,) with the greater part of itstrains, numbering about four thousand wagons, meeting with but slightopposition.  The average distance travelled by the troops that day wasabout twelve miles.  This I regarded as a great success, and it removedfrom my mind the most serious apprehensions I had entertained, that ofcrossing the river in the face of an active, large, well-appointed, andably commanded army, and how so large a train was to be carried througha hostile country, and protected.  Early on the 5th, the advance corps(the fifth, Major-General G. K. Warren commanding) met and engaged theenemy outside his intrenchments near Mine Run.  The battle ragedfuriously all day, the whole army being brought into the fight as fastas the corps could be got upon the field, which, considering the densityof the forest and narrowness of the roads, was done with commendablepromptness.General Burnside, with the ninth corps, was, at the time the Army of thePotomac moved, left with the bulk of his corps at the crossing of theRappahannock River and Alexandria Railroad, holding the road back toBull Run, with instructions not to move until he received notice that acrossing of the Rapidan was secured, but to move promptly as soon assuch notice was received.  This crossing he was apprised of on theafternoon of the 4th.  By six o'clock of the morning of the 6th he wasleading his corps into action near the Wilderness Tavern, some of histroops having marched a distance of over thirty miles, crossing both theRappahannock and Rapidan rivers.  Considering that a large proportion,probably two-thirds of his command, was composed of new troops,unaccustomed to marches, and carrying the accoutrements of a soldier,this was a remarkable march.The battle of the Wilderness was renewed by us at five o'clock on themorning of the 6th, and continued with unabated fury until darkness setin, each army holding substantially the same position that they had onthe evening of the 5th.  After dark, the enemy made a feeble attempt toturn our right flank, capturing several hundred prisoners and creatingconsiderable confusion.  But the promptness of General Sedgwick, who waspersonally present and commanded that part of our line, soon reformed itand restored order.  On the morning of the 7th, reconnoissances showedthat the enemy had fallen behind his intrenched lines, with pickets tothe front, covering a part of the battle-field.  From this it wasevident to my mind that the two days' fighting had satisfied him of hisinability to further maintain the contest in the open field,notwithstanding his advantage of position, and that he would wait anattack behind his works. I therefore determined to push on and put mywhole force between him and Richmond; and orders were at once issued fora movement by his right flank.  On the night of the 7th, the march wascommenced towards Spottsylvania Court House, the fifth corps moving onthe most direct road.  But the enemy having become apprised of ourmovement, and having the shorter line, was enabled to reach there first.On the 8th, General Warren met a force of the enemy, which had been sentout to oppose and delay his advance, to gain time to fortify the linetaken up at Spottsylvania.  This force was steadily driven back on themain force, within the recently constructed works, after considerablefighting, resulting in severe loss to both sides.  On the morning of the9th, General Sheridan started on a raid against the enemy's lines ofcommunication with Richmond.  The 9th, 10th, and 11th were spent inmanoeuvring and fighting, without decisive results.  Among the killed onthe 9th was that able and distinguished soldier Major-General JohnSedgwick, commanding the sixth army corps.  Major-General H. G. Wrightsucceeded him in command.  Early on the morning of the 12th a generalattack was made on the enemy in position.  The second corps,Major-General Hancock commanding, carried a salient of his line,capturing most of Johnson's division of Ewell's corps and twenty piecesof artillery.  But the resistance was so obstinate that the advantagegained did not prove decisive.  The 13th, 14th, 15th, 16th, 17th, and18th, were consumed in manoeuvring and awaiting the arrival ofreinforcements from Washington.  Deeming it impracticable to make anyfurther attack upon the enemy at Spottsylvania Court House, orders wereissued on the 15th with a view to a movement to the North Anna, tocommence at twelve o'clock on the night of the 19th.  Late in theafternoon of the 19th, Ewell's corps came out of its works on ourextreme right flank; but the attack was promptly repulsed, with heavyloss. This delayed the movement to the North Anna until the night of the21st, when it was commenced.  But the enemy again, having the shorterline, and being in possession of the main roads, was enabled to reachthe North Anna in advance of us, and took position behind it.  The fifthcorps reached the North Anna on the afternoon of the 23d, closelyfollowed by the sixth corps. The second and ninth corps got up about thesame time, the second holding the railroad bridge, and the ninth lyingbetween that and Jericho Ford.  General Warren effected a crossing thesame afternoon, and got a position without much opposition. Soon aftergetting into position he was violently attacked, but repulsed the enemywith great slaughter.  On the 25th, General Sheridan rejoined the Armyof the Potomac from the raid on which he started from Spottsylvania,having destroyed the depots at Beaver Dam and Ashland stations, fourtrains of cars, large supplies of rations, and many miles ofrailroad-track; recaptured about four hundred of our men on their way toRichmond as prisoners of war; met and defeated the enemy's cavalry atYellow Tavern; carried the first line of works around Richmond (butfinding the second line too strong to be carried by assault), recrossedto the north bank of the Chickahominy at Meadow Bridge under heavy fire,and moved by a detour to Haxall's Landing, on the James River, where hecommunicated with General Butler.  This raid had the effect of drawingoff the whole of the enemy's cavalry force, making it comparatively easyto guard our trains.General Butler moved his main force up the James River, in pursuance ofinstructions, on the 4th of May, General Gillmore having joined him withthe tenth corps.  At the same time he sent a force of one thousand eighthundred cavalry, by way of West Point, to form a junction with himwherever he might get a foothold, and a force of three thousand cavalry,under General Kautz, from Suffolk, to operate against the road south ofPetersburg and Richmond.  On the 5th, he occupied, without opposition,both City Point and Bermuda Hundred, his movement being a completesurprise.  On the 6th, he was in position with his main army, andcommenced intrenching.  On the 7th he made a reconnoissance against thePetersburg and Richmond Railroad, destroying a portion of it after somefighting.  On the 9th he telegraphed as follows:'HEADQUARTERS, NEAR BERMUDA LANDING, May 9, 1864.'HON. E. M. STANTON, Secretary of War.'Our operations may be summed up in a few words.  With one thousandseven hundred cavalry we have advanced up the Peninsula, forced theChickahominy, and have safely, brought them to their present position.These were colored cavalry, and are now holding our advance picketstowards Richmond.'General Kautz, with three thousand cavalry from Suffolk, on the sameday with our movement up James River, forced the Black Water, burned therailroad bridge at Stony Creek, below Petersburg, cutting intoBeauregard's force at that point.'We have landed here, intrenched ourselves, destroyed many miles ofrailroad, and got a position which, with proper supplies, we can holdout against the whole of Lee's army.  I have ordered up the supplies.'Beauregard, with a large portion of his force, was left south by thecutting of the railroads by Kautz.  That portion which reachedPetersburg under Hill I have whipped to-day, killing and wounding many,and taking many prisoners, after a severe and well-contested fight.'General Grant will not be troubled with any further reinforcements toLee from Beauregard's force.'BENJ. F. BUTLER, Major-General.'On the evening of the 13th and morning of the 14th he carried a portionof the enemy's first line of defences at Drury's Bluff, or Fort Darling,with small loss.  The time thus consumed from the 6th lost to us thebenefit of the surprise and capture of Richmond and Petersburg,enabling, as it did, Beauregard to collect his loose forces in North andSouth Carolina, and bring them to the defence of those places.  On the16th, the enemy attacked General Butler in his position in front ofDrury's Bluff.  He was forced back, or drew back, into his intrenchmentsbetween the forks of the James and Appomattox rivers, the enemyintrenching strongly in his front, thus covering his railroads, thecity, and all that was valuable to him.  His army, therefore, though ina position of great security, was as completely shut off from furtheroperations directly against Richmond as if it had been in a bottlestrongly corked.  It required but a comparatively small force of theenemy to hold it there.On the 12th, General Kautz, with his cavalry, was started on a raidagainst the Danville Railroad, which he struck at Coalfield, Powhatan,and Chula Stations, destroying them, the railroad-track, two freighttrains, and one locomotive, together with large quantities of commissaryand other stores; thence, crossing to the South Side Road, struck it atWilson's, Wellsville, and Black's and White's Stations, destroying theroad and station-houses; thence he proceeded to City Point, which hereached on the 18th.On the 19th of April, and prior to the movement of General Butler, theenemy, with a land force under General Hoke and an iron-clad ram,attacked Plymouth, N. C., commanded by General H. W. Wessells, and ourgunboats there, and, after severe fighting, the place was carried byassault, and the entire garrison and armament captured.  The gunboatSmithfield was sunk, and the Miami disabled.The army sent to operate against Richmond having hermetically sealeditself up at Bermuda Hundred, the enemy was enabled to bring the most,if not all, the reinforcements brought from the south by Beauregardagainst the Army of the Potomac. In addition to this reinforcement, avery considerable one, probably not less than fifteen thousand men, wasobtained by calling in the scattered troops under Breckinridge from thewestern part of Virginia.The position of Bermuda Hundred was as easy to defend as it wasdifficult to operate from against the enemy.  I determined, therefore,to bring from it all available forces, leaving enough only to securewhat had been gained; and accordingly, on the 22d, I directed that theybe sent forward, under command of Major-General W. F. Smith, to join theArmy of the Potomac.On the 24th of May, the 9th army corps, commanded by Major-General A. E.Burnside, was assigned to the Army of the Potomac, and from this timeforward constituted a portion of Major-General Meade's command.Finding the enemy's position on the North Anna stronger than either ofhis previous ones, I withdrew on the night of the 26th to the north bankof the North Anna, and moved via Hanover Town to turn the enemy'sposition by his right.Generals Torbert's and Merritt's divisions of cavalry, under Sheridan,and the 6th corps, led the advance, crossed the Pamunkey River atHanover Town, after considerable fighting, and on the 28th the twodivisions of cavalry had a severe, but successful engagement with theenemy at Hawes's Shop.  On the 29th and 30th we advanced, with heavyskirmishing, to the Hanover Court House and Cold Harbor Road, anddeveloped the enemy's position north of the Chickahominy.  Late on theevening of the last day the enemy came out and attacked our left, butwas repulsed with very considerable loss.  An attack was immediatelyordered by General Meade, along his whole line, which resulted indriving the enemy from a part of his intrenched skirmish line.On the 31st, General Wilson's division of cavalry destroyed the railroadbridges over the South Anna River, after defeating the enemy's cavalry.General Sheridan, on the same day, reached Cold Harbor, and held ituntil relieved by the 6th corps and General Smith's command, which hadjust arrived, via White House, from General Butler's army.On the 1st day of June an attack was made at five P.M. by the 6th corpsand the troops under General Smith, the other corps being held inreadiness to advance on the receipt of orders. This resulted in ourcarrying and holding the enemy's first line of works in front of theright of the 6th corps, and in front of General Smith.  During theattack the enemy made repeated assaults on each of the corps not engagedin the main attack, but was repulsed with heavy loss in every instance.That night he made several assaults to regain what he had lost in theday, but failed.  The 2d was spent in getting troops into position foran attack on the 3d.  On the 3d of June we again assaulted the enemy'sworks, in the hope of driving him from his position.  In this attemptour loss was heavy, while that of the enemy, I have reason to believe,was comparatively light.  It was the only general attack made from theRapidan to the James which did not inflict upon the enemy losses tocompensate for our own losses.  I would not be understood as saying thatall previous attacks resulted in victories to our arms, or accomplishedas much as I had hoped from them; but they inflicted upon the enemysevere losses, which tended, in the end, to the complete overthrow ofthe rebellion.From the proximity of the enemy to his defences around Richmond, it wasimpossible, by any flank movement, to interpose between him and thecity.  I was still in a condition to either move by his left flank, andinvest Richmond from the north side, or continue my move by his rightflank to the south side of the James.  While the former might have beenbetter as a covering for Washington, yet a full survey of all the groundsatisfied me that it would be impracticable to hold a line north andeast of Richmond that would protect the Fredericksburg Railroad, a long,vulnerable line, which would exhaust much of our strength to guard, andthat would have to be protected to supply the army, and would leave opento the enemy all his lines of communication on the south side of theJames.  My idea, from the start, had been to beat Lee's army north ofRichmond, if possible.  Then, after destroying his lines ofcommunication north of the James River, to transfer the army to thesouth side, and besiege Lee in Richmond, or follow him south if heshould retreat.  After the battle of the Wilderness, it was evident thatthe enemy deemed it of the first importance to run no risks with thearmy he then had.  He acted purely on the defensive, behind breastworks,or feebly on the offensive immediately in front of them, and where, incase of repulse, he could easily retire behind them.  Without a greatersacrifice of life than I was willing to make, all could not beaccomplished that I had designed north of Richmond.  I thereforedetermined to continue to hold substantially the ground we thenoccupied, taking advantage of any favorable circumstances that mightpresent themselves, until the cavalry could be sent to Charlottesvilleand Gordonsville to effectually break up the railroad connection betweenRichmond and the Shenandoah Valley and Lynchburg; and when the cavalrygot well off, to move the army to the south side of the James River, bythe enemy's right flank, where I felt I could cut off all his sources ofsupply, except by the canal.On the 7th, two divisions of cavalry, under General Sheridan, got off onthe expedition against the Virginia Central Railroad, with instructionsto Hunter, whom I hoped he would meet near Charlottesville, to join hisforces to Sheridan's, and after the work laid out for them wasthoroughly done, to join the Army of the Potomac by the route laid downin Sheridan's instructions.On the 10th of June, General Butler sent a force of infantry, underGeneral Gillmore, and of cavalry under General Kautz, to capturePetersburg, if possible, and destroy the railroad and common bridgesacross the Appomattox.  The cavalry carried the works on the south side,and penetrated well in towards the town, but were forced to retire.General Gillmore, finding the works which he approached very strong, anddeeming an assault impracticable, returned to Bermuda Hundred withoutattempting one.Attaching great importance to the possession of Petersburg, I sent backto Bermuda Hundred and City Point, General Smith's command by water, viathe White House, to reach there in advance of the Army of the Potomac.This was for the express purpose of securing Petersburg before theenemy, becoming aware of our intention, could reinforce the place.The movement from Cold Harbor commenced after dark on the evening of the12th.  One division of cavalry, under General Wilson, and the 5th corps,crossed the Chickahominy at Long Bridge, and moved out to White OakSwamp, to cover the crossings of the other corps.  The advance corpsreached James River, at Wilcox's Landing and Charles City Court House,on the night of the 13th.During three long years the Armies of the Potomac and Northern Virginiahad been confronting each other.  In that time they had fought moredesperate battles than it probably ever before fell to the lot of twoarmies to fight, without materially changing the vantage ground ofeither.  The Southern press and people, with more shrewdness than wasdisplayed in the North, finding that they had failed to captureWashington and march on to New York, as they had boasted they would do,assumed that they only defended their Capital and Southern territory.Hence, Antietam, Gettysburg, and all the other battles that had beenfought, were by them set down as failures on our part, and victories forthem.  Their army believed this.  It produced a morale which could onlybe overcome by desperate and continuous hard fighting.  The battles ofthe Wilderness, Spottsylvania, North Anna and Cold Harbor, bloody andterrible as they were on our side, were even more damaging to the enemy,and so crippled him as to make him wary ever after of taking theoffensive.  His losses in men were probably not so great, owing to thefact that we were, save in the Wilderness, almost invariably theattacking party; and when he did attack, it was in the open field.  Thedetails of these battles, which for endurance and bravery on the part ofthe soldiery, have rarely been surpassed, are given in the report ofMajor-General Meade, and the subordinate reports accompanying it.During the campaign of forty-three days, from the Rapidan to the JamesRiver, the army had to be supplied from an ever-shifting base, bywagons, over narrow roads, through a densely wooded country, with a lackof wharves at each new base from which to conveniently dischargevessels.  Too much credit cannot, therefore, be awarded to thequartermaster and commissary departments for the zeal and efficiencydisplayed by them. Under the general supervision of the chiefquartermaster, Brigadier-General R. Ingalls, the trains were made tooccupy all the available roads between the army and our water-base, andbut little difficulty was experienced in protecting them.The movement in the Kanawha and Shenandoah valleys, under General Sigel,commenced on the 1st of May.  General Crook, who had the immediatecommand of the Kanawha expedition, divided his forces into two columns,giving one, composed of cavalry, to General Averell.  They crossed themountains by separate routes. Averell struck the Tennessee and VirginiaRailroad, near Wytheville, on the 10th, and proceeding to New River andChristiansburg, destroyed the road, several important bridges anddepots, including New River Bridge, forming a junction with Crook atUnion on the 15th.  General Sigel moved up the Shenandoah Valley, metthe enemy at New Market on the 15th, and, after a severe engagement, wasdefeated with heavy loss, and retired behind Cedar Creek.  Not regardingthe operations of General Sigel as satisfactory, I asked his removalfrom command, and Major-General Hunter appointed to supersede him.  Hisinstructions were embraced in the following dispatches to Major-GeneralH. W. Halleck, chief of staff of the army:'NEAR SPOTTSYLVANIA COURT HOUSE, VA. 'May 20, 1864.*        *        *        *        *        *        * 'The enemy areevidently relying for supplies greatly on such as are brought over thebranch road running through Staunton.  On the whole, therefore, I thinkit would be better for General Hunter to move in that direction; reachStaunton and Gordonsville or Charlottesville, if he does not meet toomuch opposition.  If he can hold at bay a force equal to his own, hewill be doing good service.  * * *'U. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General.'MAJOR-GENERAL H. W. HALLECK.''JERICHO FORD, VA., May 25, 1864.'If Hunter can possibly get to Charlottesville and Lynchburg, he shoulddo so, living on the country.  The railroads and canal should bedestroyed beyond possibility of repairs for weeks. Completing this, hecould find his way back to his original base, or from about Gordonsvillejoin this army.'U. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General.'MAJOR-GENERAL H. W. HALLECK.'General Hunter immediately took up the offensive, and, moving up theShenandoah Valley, met the enemy on the 5th of June at Piedmont, and,after a battle of ten hours, routed and defeated him, capturing on thefield of battle one thousand five hundred men, three pieces ofartillery, and three hundred stand of small arms.  On the 8th of thesame month he formed a junction with Crook and Averell at Staunton, fromwhich place he moved direct on Lynchburg, via Lexington, which place hereached and invested on the 16th day of June.  Up to this time he wasvery successful; and but for the difficulty of taking with himsufficient ordnance stores over so long a march, through a hostilecountry, he would, no doubt, have captured that, to the enemy important,point.  The destruction of the enemy's supplies and manufactories wasvery great.  To meet this movement under General Hunter, General Leesent a force, perhaps equal to a corps, a part of which reachedLynchburg a short time before Hunter.  After some skirmishing on the17th and 18th, General Hunter, owing to a want of ammunition to givebattle, retired from before the place.  Unfortunately, this want ofammunition left him no choice of route for his return but by way ofKanawha. This lost to us the use of his troops for several weeks fromthe defence of the North.Had General Hunter moved by way of Charlottesville, instead ofLexington, as his instructions contemplated, he would have been in aposition to have covered the Shenandoah Valley against the enemy, shouldthe force he met have seemed to endanger it.  If it did not, he wouldhave been within easy distance of the James River Canal, on the mainline of communication between Lynchburg and the force sent for itsdefence.  I have never taken exception to the operations of GeneralHunter, and am not now disposed to find fault with him, for I have nodoubt he acted within what he conceived to be the spirit of hisinstructions and the interests of the service.  The promptitude of hismovements and his gallantry should entitle him to the commendation ofhis country.To return to the Army of the Potomac:  The 2d corps commenced crossingthe James River on the morning of the 14th by ferry-boats at Wilcox'sLanding.  The laying of the pontoon-bridge was completed about midnightof the 14th, and the crossing of the balance of the army was rapidlypushed forward by both bridge and ferry.After the crossing had commenced, I proceeded by steamer to BermudaHundred to give the necessary orders for the immediate capture ofPetersburg.The instructions to General Butler were verbal, and were for him to sendGeneral Smith immediately, that night, with all the troops he could givehim without sacrificing the position he then held.  I told him that Iwould return at once to the Army of the Potomac, hasten its crossing andthrow it forward to Petersburg by divisions as rapidly as it could bedone, that we could reinforce our armies more rapidly there than theenemy could bring troops against us.  General Smith got off as directed,and confronted the enemy's pickets near Petersburg before daylight nextmorning, but for some reason that I have never been able tosatisfactorily understand, did not get ready to assault his main linesuntil near sundown.  Then, with a part of his command only, he made theassault, and carried the lines north-east of Petersburg from theAppomattox River, for a distance of over two and a half miles, capturingfifteen pieces of artillery and three hundred prisoners.  This was aboutseven P.M. Between the line thus captured and Petersburg there were noother works, and there was no evidence that the enemy had reinforcedPetersburg with a single brigade from any source. The night was clearthe moon shining brightly and favorable to further operations.  GeneralHancock, with two divisions of the 2d corps, reached General Smith justafter dark, and offered the service of these troops as he (Smith) mightwish, waiving rank to the named commander, who he naturally supposedknew best the position of affairs, and what to do with the troops.  Butinstead of taking these troops and pushing at once into Petersburg, herequested General Hancock to relieve a part of his line in the capturedworks, which was done before midnight.By the time I arrived the next morning the enemy was in force. An attackwas ordered to be made at six o'clock that evening by the troops underSmith and the 2d and 9th corps.  It required until that time for the 9thcorps to get up and into position. The attack was made as ordered, andthe fighting continued with but little intermission until six o'clockthe next morning, and resulted in our carrying the advance and some ofthe main works of the enemy to the right (our left) of those previouslycaptured by General Smith, several pieces of artillery, and over fourhundred prisoners.The 5th corps having got up, the attacks were renewed and persisted inwith great vigor on the 17th and 18th, but only resulted in forcing theenemy into an interior line, from which he could not be dislodged.  Theadvantages of position gained by us were very great.  The army thenproceeded to envelop Petersburg towards the South Side Railroad as faras possible without attacking fortifications.On the 16th the enemy, to reinforce Petersburg, withdrew from a part ofhis intrenchment in front of Bermuda Hundred, expecting, no doubt, toget troops from north of the James to take the place of those withdrawnbefore we could discover it.  General Butler, taking advantage of this,at once moved a force on the railroad between Petersburg and Richmond.As soon as I was apprised of the advantage thus gained, to retain it Iordered two divisions of the 6th corps, General Wright commanding, thatwere embarking at Wilcox's Landing, under orders for City Point, toreport to General Butler at Bermuda Hundred, of which General Butler wasnotified, and the importance of holding a position in advance of hispresent line urged upon him.About two o'clock in the afternoon General Butler was forced back to theline the enemy had withdrawn from in the morning. General Wright, withhis two divisions, joined General Butler on the forenoon of the 17th,the latter still holding with a strong picket-line the enemy's works.But instead of putting these divisions into the enemy's works to holdthem, he permitted them to halt and rest some distance in the rear ofhis own line. Between four and five o'clock in the afternoon the enemyattacked and drove in his pickets and re-occupied his old line.On the night of the 20th and morning of the 21st a lodgment was effectedby General Butler, with one brigade of infantry, on the north bank ofthe James, at Deep Bottom, and connected by pontoon-bridge with BermudaHundred.On the 19th, General Sheridan, on his return from his expedition againstthe Virginia Central Railroad, arrived at the White House just as theenemy's cavalry was about to attack it, and compelled it to retire.  Theresult of this expedition was, that General Sheridan met the enemy'scavalry near Trevilian Station, on the morning of the 11th of June, whomhe attacked, and after an obstinate contest drove from the field incomplete rout.  He left his dead and nearly all his wounded in ourhands, and about four hundred prisoners and several hundred horses.  Onthe 12th he destroyed the railroad from Trevilian Station to LouisaCourt House.  This occupied until three o'clock P.M., when he advancedin the direction of Gordonsville.  He found the enemy reinforced byinfantry, behind well-constructed rifle-pits, about five miles from thelatter place and too strong to successfully assault.  On the extremeright, however, his reserve brigade carried the enemy's works twice, andwas twice driven therefrom by infantry.  Night closed the contest.  Nothaving sufficient ammunition to continue the engagement, and his animalsbeing without forage (the country furnishing but inferior grazing), andhearing nothing from General Hunter, he withdrew his command to thenorth side of the North Anna, and commenced his return march, reachingWhite House at the time before stated.  After breaking up the depot atthat place, he moved to the James River, which he reached safely afterheavy fighting.  He commenced crossing on the 25th, near Fort Powhatan,without further molestation, and rejoined the Army of the Potomac.On the 22d, General Wilson, with his own division of cavalry of the Armyof the Potomac, and General Kautz's division of cavalry of the Army ofthe James moved against the enemy's railroads south of Richmond.Striking the Weldon Railroad at Reams's Station, destroying the depotand several miles of the road, and the South Side road about fifteenmiles from Petersburg, to near Nottoway Station, where he met anddefeated a force of the enemy's cavalry.  He reached Burkesville Stationon the afternoon of the 23d, and from there destroyed the DanvilleRailroad to Roanoke Bridge, a distance of twenty-five miles, where hefound the enemy in force, and in a position from which he could notdislodge him.  He then commenced his return march, and on the 28th metthe enemy's cavalry in force at the Weldon Railroad crossing of StonyCreek, where he had a severe but not decisive engagement.  Thence hemade a detour from his left with a view of reaching Reams's Station(supposing it to be in our possession).  At this place he was met by theenemy's cavalry, supported by infantry, and forced to retire, with theloss of his artillery and trains.  In this last encounter, GeneralKautz, with a part of his command, became separated, and made his wayinto our lines.  General Wilson, with the remainder of his force,succeeded in crossing the Nottoway River and coming in safely on ourleft and rear.  The damage to the enemy in this expedition more thancompensated for the losses we sustained.  It severed all connection byrailroad with Richmond for several weeks.With a view of cutting the enemy's railroad from near Richmond to theAnna rivers, and making him wary of the situation of his army in theShenandoah, and, in the event of failure in this, to take advantage ofhis necessary withdrawal of troops from Petersburg, to explode a minethat had been prepared in front of the 9th corps and assault the enemy'slines at that place, on the night of the 26th of July the 2d corps andtwo divisions of the cavalry corps and Kautz's cavalry were crossed tothe north bank of the James River and joined the force General Butlerhad there.  On the 27th the enemy was driven from his intrenchedposition, with the loss of four pieces of artillery.  On the 28th ourlines were extended from Deep Bottom to New Market Road, but in gettingthis position were attacked by the enemy in heavy force.  The fightinglasted for several hours, resulting in considerable loss to both sides.The first object of this move having failed, by reason of the very largeforce thrown there by the enemy, I determined to take advantage of thediversion made, by assaulting Petersburg before he could get his forceback there.  One division of the 2d corps was withdrawn on the night ofthe 28th, and moved during the night to the rear of the 18th corps, torelieve that corps in the line, that it might be foot-loose in theassault to be made.  The other two divisions of the 2d corps andSheridan's cavalry were crossed over on the night of the 29th and movedin front of Petersburg.  On the morning of the 30th, between four andfive o'clock, the mine was sprung, blowing up a battery and most of aregiment, and the advance of the assaulting column, formed of the 9thcorps, immediately took possession of the crater made by the explosion,and the line for some distance to the right and left of it, and adetached line in front of it, but for some cause failed to advancepromptly to the ridge beyond.  Had they done this, I have every reasonto believe that Petersburg would have fallen.  Other troops wereimmediately pushed forward, but the time consumed in getting them upenabled the enemy to rally from his surprise (which had been complete),and get forces to this point for its defence.  The captured line thusheld being untenable, and of no advantage to us, the troops werewithdrawn, but not without heavy loss.  Thus terminated in disaster whatpromised to be the most successful assault of the campaign.Immediately upon the enemy's ascertaining that General Hunter wasretreating from Lynchburg by way of the Kanawha River, thus laying theShenandoah Valley open for raid into Maryland and Pennsylvania, hereturned northward and moved down that valley.  As soon as this movementof the enemy was ascertained, General Hunter, who had reached theKanawha River, was directed to move his troops without delay, by riverand railroad, to Harper's Ferry; but owing to the difficulty ofnavigation by reason of low water and breaks in the railroad, greatdelay was experienced in getting there.  It became necessary, therefore,to find other troops to check this movement of the enemy.  For thispurpose the 6th corps was taken from the armies operating againstRichmond, to which was added the 19th corps, then fortunately beginningto arrive in Hampton Roads from the Gulf Department, under orders issuedimmediately after the ascertainment of the result of the Red Riverexpedition.  The garrisons of Baltimore and Washington were at this timemade up of heavy-artillery regiments, hundred days' men, and detachmentsfrom the invalid corps.  One division under command of General Ricketts,of the 6th corps, was sent to Baltimore, and the remaining two divisionsof the 6th corps, under General Wright, were subsequently sent toWashington.  On the 3d of July the enemy approached Martinsburg.General Sigel, who was in command of our forces there, retreated acrossthe Potomac at Shepherdtown; and General Weber, commanding at Harper'sFerry, crossed the occupied Hagerstown, moving a strong column towardsFrederick City.  General Wallace, with Rickett's division and his owncommand, the latter mostly new and undisciplined troops, pushed out fromBaltimore with great promptness, and met the enemy in force on theMonocacy, near the crossing of the railroad bridge.  His force was notsufficient to insure success, but he fought the enemy nevertheless, andalthough it resulted in a defeat to our arms, yet it detained the enemy,and thereby served to enable General Wright to reach Washington with twodivision of the 6th corps, and the advance of the 19th corps, beforehim.  From Monocacy the enemy moved on Washington, his cavalry advancereaching Rockville on the evening of the 10th.  On the 12th areconnoissance was thrown out in front of Fort Stevens, to ascertain theenemy's position and force.  A severe skirmish ensued, in which we lostabout two hundred and eighty in killed and wounded.  The enemy's losswas probably greater.  He commenced retreating during the night.Learning the exact condition of affairs at Washington, I requested bytelegraph, at forty-five minutes past eleven P.M., on the 12th, theassignment of Major-General H. G. Wright to the command of all thetroops that could be made available to operate in the field against theenemy, and directed that he should get outside of the trenches with allthe force he could, and push Early to the last moment.  General Wrightcommenced the pursuit on the 13th; on the 18th the enemy was overtakenat Snicker's Ferry, on the Shenandoah, when a sharp skirmish occurred;and on the 20th, General Averell encountered and defeated a portion ofthe rebel army at Winchester, capturing four pieces of artillery andseveral hundred prisoners.Learning that Early was retreating south towards Lynchburg or Richmond,I directed that the 6th and 19th corps be got back to the armiesoperating against Richmond, so that they might be used in a movementagainst Lee before the return of the troops sent by him into the valley;and that Hunter should remain in the Shenandoah Valley, keeping betweenany force of the enemy and Washington, acting on the defensive as muchas possible.  I felt that if the enemy had any notion of returning, thefact would be developed before the 6th and 19th corps could leaveWashington.  Subsequently, the 19th corps was excepted form the order toreturn to the James.About the 25th it became evident that the enemy was again advancing uponMaryland and Pennsylvania, and the 6th corps, then at Washington, wasordered back to the vicinity of Harper's Ferry.  The rebel force moveddown the valley, and sent a raiding party into Pennsylvania which on the30th burned Chambersburg, and then retreated, pursued by our cavalry,towards Cumberland.  They were met and defeated by General Kelley, andwith diminished numbers escaped into the mountains of West Virginia.From the time of the first raid the telegraph wires were frequently downbetween Washington and City Point, making it necessary to transmitmessages a part of the way by boat.  It took from twenty-four tothirty-six hours to get dispatches through and return answers would bereceived showing a different state of facts from those on which theywere based, causing confusion and apparent contradiction of orders thatmust have considerably embarrassed those who had to execute them, andrendered operations against the enemy less effective than they otherwisewould have been. To remedy this evil, it was evident to my mind thatsome person should have the supreme command of all the forces in theDepartment of West Virginia, Washington, Susquehanna, and the MiddleDepartment, and I so recommended.On the 2d of August, I ordered General Sheridan to report in person toMajor-General Halleck, chief of staff, at Washington, with a view to hisassignment to the command of all the forces against Early.  At this timethe enemy was concentrated in the neighborhood of Winchester, while ourforces, under General Hunter, were concentrated on the Monocacy, at thecrossing of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, leaving open to the enemyWestern Maryland and Southern Pennsylvania.  From where I was, Ihesitated to give positive orders for the movement of our forces atMonocacy, lest by so doing I should expose Washington. Therefore, on the4th, I left City Point to visit Hunter's command, and determine formyself what was best to be done.  On arrival there, and afterconsultation with General Hunter, I issued to him the followinginstructions:'MONOCACY BRIDGE, MARYLAND, August 5, 1864--8 P.M.'GENERAL:--Concentrate all your available force without delay in thevicinity of Harper's Ferry, leaving only such railroad guards andgarrisons for public property as may be necessary.  Use, in thisconcentrating, the railroad, if by so doing time can be saved.  FromHarper's Ferry, if it is found that the enemy has moved north of thePotomac in large force, push north, following him and attacking himwherever found; follow him, if driven south of the Potomac, as long asit is safe to do so.  If it is ascertained that the enemy has but asmall force north of the Potomac, then push south with the main force,detaching under a competent commander, a sufficient force to look afterthe raiders, and drive them to their homes.  In detaching such a force,the brigade of the cavalry now en route from Washington via Rockvillemay be taken into account.'There are now on their way to join you three other brigades of the bestcavalry, numbering at least five thousand men and horses.  These will beinstructed, in the absence of further orders, to join you by the southside of the Potomac.  One brigade will probably start to-morrow.  Inpushing up the Shenandoah Valley, where it is expected you will have togo first or last, it is desirable that nothing should be left to invitethe enemy to return.  Take all provisions, forage, and stock wanted forthe use of your command; such as cannot be consumed, destroy.  It is notdesirable that the buildings should be destroyed--they should rather beprotected; but the people should be informed that, so long as an armycan subsist among them, recurrence of theses raids must be expected, andwe are determined to stop them at all hazards.'Bear in mind, the object is to drive the enemy south; and to do thisyou want to keep him always in sight.  Be guided in your course by thecourse he takes.'Make your own arrangements for supplies of all kinds, giving regularvouchers for such as may be taken from loyal citizens in the countrythrough which you march.'U. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General.'MAJOR-GENERAL D. HUNTER.'The troops were immediately put in motion, and the advance reachedHalltown that night.General Hunter having, in our conversation, expressed a willingness tobe relieved from command, I telegraphed to have General Sheridan, thenat Washington, sent to Harper's Ferry by the morning train, with ordersto take general command of all the troops in the field, and to call onGeneral Hunter at Monocacy, who would turn over to him my letter ofinstructions.  I remained at Monocacy until General Sheridan arrived, onthe morning of the 6th, and, after a conference with him in relation tomilitary affairs in that vicinity, I returned to City Point by way ofWashington.On the 7th of August, the Middle Department, and the Departments of WestVirginia, Washington, and Susquehanna, were constituted into the 'MiddleMilitary Division,' and  Major-General Sheridan was assigned totemporary command of the same.Two divisions of cavalry, commanded by Generals Torbert and Wilson, weresent to Sheridan from the Army of the Potomac. The first reached him atHarper's Ferry about the 11th of August.His operations during the month of August and the fore part of Septemberwere both of an offensive and defensive character, resulting in manysevere skirmishes, principally by the cavalry, in which we weregenerally successful, but no general engagement took place.  The twoarmies lay in such a position--the enemy on the west bank of the OpequonCreek covering Winchester, and our forces in front of Berryville--thateither could bring on a battle at any time.  Defeat to us would lay opento the enemy the States of Maryland and Pennsylvania for long distancesbefore another army could be interposed to check him.  Under thesecircumstances I hesitated about allowing the initiative to be taken.Finally, the use of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, and the Chesapeakeand Ohio Canal, which were both obstructed by the enemy, became soindispensably necessary to us, and the importance of relievingPennsylvania and Maryland from continuously threatened invasion sogreat, that I determined the risk should be taken.  But fearing totelegraph the order for an attack without knowing more than I did ofGeneral Sheridan's feelings as to what would be the probable result, Ileft City Point on the 15th of September to visit him at hisheadquarters, to decide, after conference with him, what should be done.I met him at Charlestown, and he pointed out so distinctly how each armylay; what he could do the moment he was authorized, and expressed suchconfidence of success, that I saw there were but two words ofinstructions necessary--Go in!  For the conveniences of forage, theteams for supplying the army were kept at Harper's Ferry.  I asked himif he could get out his teams and supplies in time to make an attack onthe ensuing Tuesday morning.  His reply was, that he could beforedaylight on Monday.  He was off promptly to time, and I may here add,that the result was such that I have never since deemed it necessary tovisit General Sheridan before giving him orders.Early on the morning of the 19th, General Sheridan attacked GeneralEarly at the crossing on the Opequon Creek, and after a most sanguinaryand bloody battle, lasting until five o'clock in the evening, defeatedhim with heavy loss, carrying his entire position from Opequon Creek toWinchester, capturing several thousand prisoners and five pieces ofartillery.  The enemy rallied, and made a stand in a strong position atFisher's Hill, where he was attacked, and again defeated with heavy losson the 20th [22d].  Sheridan pursued him with great energy throughHarrisonburg, Staunton, and the gaps of the Blue Ridge.  After strippingthe upper valley of most of the supplies and provisions for the rebelarmy, he returned to Strasburg, and took position on the north side ofCedar Creek.Having received considerable reinforcements, General Early againreturned to the valley, and, on the 9th of October, his cavalryencountered ours near Strasburg, where the rebels were defeated, withthe loss of eleven pieces of artillery and three hundred and fiftyprisoners.  On the night of the 18th, the enemy crossed the mountainswhich separate the branches of the Shenandoah, forded the North Fork,and early on the morning of the 19th, under cover of the darkness andthe fog, surprised and turned our left flank, and captured the batterieswhich enfiladed our whole line.  Our troops fell back with heavy lossand in much confusion, but were finally rallied between Middletown andNewtown.  At this juncture, General Sheridan, who was at Winchester whenthe battle commenced arrived on the field, arranged his lines just intime to repulse a heavy attack of the enemy, and immediately assumingthe offensive, he attacked in turn with great vigor.  The enemy wasdefeated with great slaughter, and the loss of most of his artillery andtrains, and the trophies he had captured in the morning.  The wreck ofhis army escaped during the night, and fled in the direction of Stauntonand Lynchburg.  Pursuit was made to Mount Jackson. Thus ended this, theenemy's last attempt to invade the North via the Shenandoah Valley.  Iwas now enabled to return the 6th corps to the Army of the Potomac, andto send one division from Sheridan's army to the Army of the James, andanother to Savannah, Georgia, to hold Sherman's new acquisitions on thesea-coast, and thus enable him to move without detaching from his forcefor that purpose.Reports from various sources led me to believe that the enemy haddetached three divisions from Petersburg to reinforce Early in theShenandoah Valley.  I therefore sent the 2d corps and Gregg's divisionof cavalry, of the Army of the Potomac, and a force of General Butler'sarmy, on the night of the 13th of August, to threaten Richmond from thenorth side of the James, to prevent him from sending troops away, and,if possible, to draw back those sent.  In this move we captured sixpieces of artillery and several hundred prisoners, detained troops thatwere under marching orders, and ascertained that but one division(Kershaw's), of the three reputed detached, had gone.The enemy having withdrawn heavily from Petersburg to resist thismovement, the 5th corps, General Warren commanding, was moved out on the18th, and took possession of the Weldon Railroad.  During the day he hadconsiderable fighting.  To regain possession of the road, the enemy maderepeated and desperate assaults, but was each time repulsed with greatloss.  On the night of the 20th, the troops on the north side of theJames were withdrawn, and Hancock and Gregg returned to the front atPetersburg.  On the 25th, the 2d corps and Gregg's division of cavalry,while at Reams's Station destroying the railroad, were attacked, andafter desperate fighting, a part of our line gave way, and five piecesof artillery fell into the hands of the enemy.By the 12th of September, a branch railroad was completed from the CityPoint and Petersburg Railroad to the Weldon Railroad, enabling us tosupply, without difficulty, in all weather, the army in front ofPetersburg.The extension of our lines across the Weldon Railroad compelled theenemy to so extend his, that it seemed he could have but few troopsnorth of the James for the defence of Richmond.  On the night of the28th, the 10th corps, Major-General Birney, and the 18th corps,Major-General Ord commanding, of General Butler's army, were crossed tothe north side of the James, and advanced on the morning of the 29th,carrying the very strong fortifications and intrenchments belowChaffin's Farm, known as Fort Harrison, capturing fifteen pieces ofartillery, and the New Market Road and intrenchments.  This success wasfollowed up by a gallant assault upon Fort Gilmer, immediately in frontof the Chaffin Farm fortifications, in which we were repulsed with heavyloss.  Kautz's cavalry was pushed forward on the road to the right ofthis, supported by infantry, and reached the enemy's inner line, but wasunable to get further.  The position captured from the enemy was sothreatening to Richmond, that I determined to hold it.  The enemy madeseveral desperate attempts to dislodge us, all of which wereunsuccessful, and for which he paid dearly.  On the morning of the 30th,General Meade sent out a reconnoissance with a view to attacking theenemy's line, if it was found sufficiently weakened by withdrawal oftroops to the north side.  In this reconnoissance we captured and heldthe enemy's works near Poplar Spring Church.  In the afternoon, troopsmoving to get to the left of the point gained were attacked by the enemyin heavy force, and compelled to fall back until supported by the forcesholding the captured works. Our cavalry under Gregg was also attacked,but repulsed the enemy with great loss.On the 7th of October, the enemy attacked Kautz's cavalry north of theJames, and drove it back with heavy loss in killed, wounded, andprisoners, and the loss of all the artillery eight or nine pieces.  Thishe followed up by an attack on our intrenched infantry line, but wasrepulsed with severe slaughter.  On the 13th, a reconnoissance was sentout by General Butler, with a view to drive the enemy from some newworks he was constructing, which resulted in very heavy loss to us.On the 27th, the Army of the Potomac, leaving only sufficient men tohold its fortified line, moved by the enemy's right flank.  The 2dcorps, followed by two divisions of the 5th corps, with the cavalry inadvance and covering our left flank, forced a passage of Hatcher's Run,and moved up the south side of it towards the South Side Railroad, untilthe 2d corps and part of the cavalry reached the Boydton Plank Roadwhere it crosses Hatcher's Run.  At this point we were six miles distantfrom the South Side Railroad, which I had hoped by this movement toreach and hold.  But finding that we had not reached the end of theenemy's fortifications, and no place presenting itself for a successfulassault by which he might be doubled up and shortened, I determined towithdraw to within our fortified line.  Orders were given accordingly.Immediately upon receiving a report that General Warren had connectedwith General Hancock, I returned to my headquarters.  Soon after I leftthe enemy moved out across Hatcher's Run, in the gap between GeneralsHancock and Warren, which was not closed as reported, and made adesperate attack on General Hancock's right and rear.  General Hancockimmediately faced his corps to meet it, and after a bloody combat drovethe enemy within his works, and withdrew that night to his old position.In support of this movement, General Butler made a demonstration on thenorth side of the James, and attacked the enemy on the WilliamsburgRoad, and also on the York River Railroad.  In the former he wasunsuccessful; in the latter he succeeded in carrying a work which wasafterwards abandoned, and his forces withdrawn to their formerpositions.From this time forward the operations in front of Petersburg andRichmond, until the spring campaign of 1865, were confined to thedefence and extension of our lines, and to offensive movements forcrippling the enemy's lines of communication, and to prevent hisdetaching any considerable force to send south.  By the 7th of February,our lines were extended to Hatcher's Run, and the Weldon Railroad hadbeen destroyed to Hicksford.General Sherman moved from Chattanooga on the 6th of May, with theArmies of the Cumberland, Tennessee, and Ohio, commanded, respectively,by Generals Thomas McPherson, and Schofield, upon Johnston's army atDalton; but finding the enemy's position at Buzzard's Roost, coveringDalton, too strong to be assaulted, General McPherson was sent throughSnake Gap to turn it, while Generals Thomas and Schofield threatened itin front and on the north.  This movement was successful.  Johnston,finding his retreat likely to be cut off, fell back to his fortifiedposition at Resaca, where he was attacked on the afternoon of May 15th.A heavy battle ensued.  During the night the enemy retreated south.Late on the 17th, his rear-guard was overtaken near Adairsville, andheavy skirmishing followed.  The next morning, however, he had againdisappeared.  He was vigorously pursued, and was overtaken at Cassvilleon the 19th, but during the ensuing night retreated across the Etowah.While these operations were going on, General Jefferson C. Davis'sdivision of Thomas's army was sent to Rome, capturing it with its fortsand artillery, and its valuable mills and foundries.  General Sherman,having give his army a few days' rest at this point, again put it inmotion on the 23d, for Dallas, with a view of turning the difficult passat Allatoona.  On the afternoon of the 25th, the advance, under GeneralHooker, had a severe battle with the enemy, driving him back to New HopeChurch, near Dallas.  Several sharp encounters occurred at this point.The most important was on the 28th, when the enemy assaulted GeneralMcPherson at Dallas, but received a terrible and bloody repulse.On the 4th of June, Johnston abandoned his intrenched position at NewHope Church, and retreated to the strong positions of Kenesaw, Pine, andLost mountains.  He was forced to yield the two last-named places, andconcentrate his army on Kenesaw, where, on the 27th, Generals Thomas andMcPherson made a determined but unsuccessful assault.  On the night ofthe 2d of July, Sherman commenced moving his army by the right flank,and on the morning of the 3d, found that the enemy, in consequence ofthis movement, had abandoned Kenesaw and retreated across theChattahoochee.General Sherman remained on the Chattahoochee to give his men rest andget up stores until the 17th of July, when he resumed his operations,crossed the Chattahoochee, destroyed a large portion of the railroad toAugusta, and drove the enemy back to Atlanta. At this place General Hoodsucceeded General Johnston in command of the rebel army, and assumingthe offensive-defensive policy, made several severe attacks upon Shermanin the vicinity of Atlanta, the most desperate and determined of whichwas on the 22d of July.  About one P.M. of this day the brave,accomplished, and noble-hearted McPherson was killed.  General Logansucceeded him, and commanded the Army of the Tennessee through thisdesperate battle, and until he was superseded by Major-General Howard,on the 26th, with the same success and ability that had characterizedhim in the command of a corps or division.In all these attacks the enemy was repulsed with great loss. Finding itimpossible to entirely invest the place, General Sherman, after securinghis line of communications across the Chattahoochee, moved his mainforce round by the enemy's left flank upon the Montgomery and Maconroads, to draw the enemy from his fortifications.  In this he succeeded,and after defeating the enemy near Rough-and-Ready, Jonesboro, andLovejoy's, forcing him to retreat to the south, on the 2d of Septemberoccupied Atlanta, the objective point of his campaign.About the time of this move, the rebel cavalry, under Wheeler, attemptedto cut his communications in the rear, but was repulsed at Dalton, anddriven into East Tennessee, whence it proceeded west to McMinnville,Murfreesboro, and Franklin, and was finally driven south of theTennessee.  The damage done by this raid was repaired in a few days.During the partial investment of Atlanta, General Rousseau joinedGeneral Sherman with a force of cavalry from Decatur, having made asuccessful raid upon the Atlanta and Montgomery Railroad, and itsbranches near Opelika. Cavalry raids were also made by Generals McCook,Garrard, and Stoneman, to cut the remaining Railroad communication withAtlanta.  The first two were successful the latter, disastrous.General Sherman's movement from Chattanooga to Atlanta was prompt,skilful, and brilliant.  The history of his flank movements and battlesduring that memorable campaign will ever be read with an interestunsurpassed by anything in history.His own report, and those of his subordinate commanders, accompanyingit, give the details of that most successful campaign.He was dependent for the supply of his armies upon a single-trackrailroad from Nashville to the point where he was operating.  Thispassed the entire distance through a hostile country, and every foot ofit had to be protected by troops. The cavalry force of the enemy underForrest, in Northern Mississippi, was evidently waiting for Sherman toadvance far enough into the mountains of Georgia, to make a retreatdisastrous, to get upon this line and destroy it beyond the possibilityof further use.  To guard against this danger, Sherman left what hesupposed to be a sufficient force to operate against Forrest in WestTennessee.  He directed General Washburn, who commanded there, to sendBrigadier-General S. D. Sturgis in command of this force to attack him.On the morning of the 10th of June, General Sturgis met the enemy nearGuntown, Mississippi, was badly beaten, and driven back in utter routand confusion to Memphis, a distance of about one hundred miles, hotlypursued by the enemy.  By this, however, the enemy was defeated in hisdesigns upon Sherman's line of communications. The persistency withwhich he followed up this success exhausted him, and made a season forrest and repairs necessary.  In the meantime, Major-General A. J. Smith,with the troops of the Army of the Tennessee that had been sent byGeneral Sherman to General Banks, arrived at Memphis on their returnfrom Red River, where they had done most excellent service.  He wasdirected by General Sherman to immediately take the offensive againstForrest.  This he did with the promptness and effect which hascharacterized his whole military career.  On the 14th of July, he metthe enemy at Tupelo, Mississippi, and whipped him badly.  The fightingcontinued through three days.  Our loss was small compared with that ofthe enemy.  Having accomplished the object of his expedition, GeneralSmith returned to Memphis.During the months of March and April this same force under Forrestannoyed us considerably.  On the 24th of March it captured Union City,Kentucky, and its garrison, and on the 24th attacked Paducah, commandedby Colonel S. G. Hicks, 40th Illinois Volunteers.  Colonel H., havingbut a small force, withdrew to the forts near the river, from where herepulsed the enemy and drove him from the place.On the 13th of April, part of this force, under the rebel GeneralBuford, summoned the garrison of Columbus, Kentucky, to surrender, butreceived for reply from Colonel Lawrence, 34th New Jersey Volunteers,that being placed there by his Government with adequate force to holdhis post and repel all enemies from it, surrender was out of thequestion.On the morning of the same day Forrest attacked Fort Pillow, Tennessee,garrisoned by a detachment of Tennessee cavalry and the 1st RegimentAlabama colored troops, commanded by Major Booth.  The garrison foughtbravely until about three o'clock in the afternoon, when the enemycarried the works by assault; and, after our men threw down their arms,proceeded to an inhuman and merciless massacre of the garrison.On the 14th, General Buford, having failed at Columbus, appeared beforePaducah, but was again driven off.Guerillas and raiders, seemingly emboldened by Forrest's operations,were also very active in Kentucky.  The most noted of these was Morgan.With a force of from two to three thousand cavalry, he entered the Statethrough Pound Gap in the latter part of May.  On the 11th of June theyattacked and captured Cynthiana, with its entire garrison.  On the 12thhe was overtaken by General Burbridge, and completely routed with heavyloss, and was finally driven out of the State.  This notorious guerillawas afterwards surprised and killed near Greenville, Tennessee, and hiscommand captured and dispersed by General Gillem.In the absence of official reports of the commencement of the Red Riverexpedition, except so far as relates to the movements of the troops sentby General Sherman under General A. J. Smith, I am unable to give thedate of its starting.  The troops under General Smith, comprising twodivisions of the 16th and a detachment of the 17th army corps, leftVicksburg on the 10th of March, and reached the designated point on RedRiver one day earlier than that appointed by General Banks.  The rebelforces at Fort de Russy, thinking to defeat him, left the fort on the14th to give him battle in the open field; but, while occupying theenemy with skirmishing and demonstrations, Smith pushed forward to Fortde Russy, which had been left with a weak garrison, and captured it withits garrison about three hundred and fifty men, eleven pieces ofartillery, and many small-arms.  Our loss was but slight.  On the 15thhe pushed forward to Alexandria, which place he reached on the 18th.  Onthe 21st he had an engagement with the enemy at Henderson's Hill, inwhich he defeated him, capturing two hundred and ten prisoners and fourpieces of artillery.On the 28th, he again attacked and defeated the enemy under the rebelGeneral Taylor, at Cane River.  By the 26th, General Banks had assembledhis whole army at Alexandria, and pushed forward to Grand Ecore.  On themorning of April 6th he moved from Grand Ecore.  On the afternoon of the7th, he advanced and met the enemy near Pleasant Hill, and drove himfrom the field.  On the same afternoon the enemy made a stand eightmiles beyond Pleasant Hill, but was again compelled to retreat.  On the8th, at Sabine Cross Roads and Peach Hill, the enemy attacked anddefeated his advance, capturing nineteen pieces of artillery and animmense amount of transportation and stores.  During the night, GeneralBanks fell back to Pleasant Hill, where another battle was fought on the9th, and the enemy repulsed with great loss.  During the night, GeneralBanks continued his retrograde movement to Grand Ecore, and thence toAlexandria, which he reached on the 27th of April.  Here a seriousdifficulty arose in getting Admiral Porter's fleet which accompanied theexpedition, over the rapids, the water having fallen so much since theypassed up as to prevent their return.  At the suggestion of Colonel (nowBrigadier-General) Bailey, and under his superintendence, wing-dams wereconstructed, by which the channel was contracted so that the fleetpassed down the rapids in safety.The army evacuated Alexandria on the 14th of May, after considerableskirmishing with the enemy's advance, and reached Morganzia and PointCoupee near the end of the month.  The disastrous termination of thisexpedition, and the lateness of the season, rendered impracticable thecarrying out of my plans of a movement in force sufficient to insure thecapture of Mobile.On the 23d of March, Major-General Steele left Little Rock with the 7tharmy corps, to  cooperate with General Banks's expedition on the RedRiver, and reached Arkadelphia on the 28th.  On the 16th of April, afterdriving the enemy before him, he was joined, near Elkin's Ferry, inWashita County, by General Thayer, who had marched from Fort Smith.After several severe skirmishes, in which the enemy was defeated,General Steele reached Camden, which he occupied about the middle ofApril.On learning the defeat and consequent retreat of General Banks on RedRiver, and the loss of one of his own trains at Mark's Mill, in DallasCounty, General Steele determined to fall back to the Arkansas River.He left Camden on the 26th of April, and reached Little Rock on the 2dof May.  On the 30th of April, the enemy attacked him while crossingSaline River at Jenkins's Ferry, but was repulsed with considerableloss.  Our loss was about six hundred in killed, wounded and prisoners.Major-General Canby, who had been assigned to the command of the'Military Division of the West Mississippi,' was therefore directed tosend the 19th army corps to join the armies operating against Richmond,and to limit the remainder of his command to such operations as might benecessary to hold the positions and lines of communications he thenoccupied.Before starting General A. J. Smith's troops back to Sherman, GeneralCanby sent a part of it to disperse a force of the enemy that wascollecting near the Mississippi River.  General Smith met and defeatedthis force near Lake Chicot on the 5th of June.  Our loss was aboutforty killed and seventy wounded.In the latter part of July, General Canby sent Major-General GordonGranger, with such forces as he could collect, to co-operate withAdmiral Farragut against the defences of Mobile Bay.  On the 8th ofAugust, Fort Gaines surrendered to the combined naval and land forces.Fort Powell was blown up and abandoned.On the 9th, Fort Morgan was invested, and, after a severe bombardment,surrendered on the 23d.  The total captures amounted to one thousandfour hundred and sixty-four prisoners, and one hundred and four piecesof artillery.About the last of August, it being reported that the rebel GeneralPrice, with a force of about ten thousand men, had reached Jacksonport,on his way to invade Missouri, General A. J. Smith's command, then enroute from Memphis to join Sherman, was ordered to Missouri.  A cavalryforce was also, at the same time, sent from Memphis, under command ofColonel Winslow.  This made General Rosecrans's forces superior to thoseof Price, and no doubt was entertained he would be able to check Priceand drive him back; while the forces under General Steele, in Arkansas,would cut off his retreat.  On the 26th day of September, Price attackedPilot Knob and forced the garrison to retreat, and thence moved north tothe Missouri River, and continued up that river towards Kansas.  GeneralCurtis, commanding Department of Kansas, immediately collected suchforces as he could to repel the invasion of Kansas, while GeneralRosecrans's cavalry was operating in his rear.The enemy was brought to battle on the Big Blue and defeated, with theloss of nearly all his artillery and trains and a large number ofprisoners.  He made a precipitate retreat to Northern Arkansas.  Theimpunity with which Price was enabled to roam over the State of Missourifor a long time, and the incalculable mischief done by him, show to howlittle purpose a superior force may be used.  There is no reason whyGeneral Rosecrans should not have concentrated his forces, and beatenand driven Price before the latter reached Pilot Knob.September 20th, the enemy's cavalry, under Forrest, crossed theTennessee near Waterloo, Alabama, and on the 23d attacked the garrisonat Athens, consisting of six hundred men, which capitulated on the 24th.Soon after the surrender two regiments of reinforcements arrived, andafter a severe fight were compelled to surrender.  Forrest destroyed therailroad westward, captured the garrison at Sulphur Branch trestle,skirmished with the garrison at Pulaski on the 27th, and on the same daycut the Nashville and Chattanooga Railroad near Tullahoma and Dechard.On the morning of the 30th, one column of Forrest's command, underBuford, appeared before Huntsville, and summoned the surrender of thegarrison.  Receiving an answer in the negative, he remained in thevicinity of the place until next morning, when he again summoned itssurrender, and received the same reply as on the night before.  Hewithdrew in the direction of Athens which place had been regarrisoned,and attacked it on the afternoon of the 1st of October, but withoutsuccess.  On the morning of the 2d he renewed his attack, but washandsomely repulsed.Another column under Forrest appeared before Columbia on the morning ofthe 1st, but did not make an attack.  On the morning of the 3d he movedtowards Mount Pleasant.  While these operations were going on, everyexertion was made by General Thomas to destroy the forces under Forrestbefore he could recross the Tennessee, but was unable to prevent hisescape to Corinth, Mississippi.In September, an expedition under General Burbridge was sent to destroythe saltworks at Saltville, Virginia. He met the enemy on the 2d ofOctober, about three miles and a half from Saltville, and drove him intohis strongly intrenched position around the salt-works, from which hewas unable to dislodge him.  During the night he withdrew his commandand returned to Kentucky.General Sherman, immediately after the fall of Atlanta, put his armiesin camp in and about the place, and made all preparations for refittingand supplying them for future service.  The great length of road fromAtlanta to the Cumberland River, however, which had to be guarded,allowed the troops but little rest.During this time Jefferson Davis made a speech in Macon, Georgia, whichwas reported in the papers of the South, and soon became known to thewhole country, disclosing the plans of the enemy, thus enabling GeneralSherman to fully meet them.  He exhibited the weakness of supposing thatan army that had been beaten and fearfully decimated in a vain attemptat the defensive, could successfully undertake the offensive against thearmy that had so often defeated it.In execution of this plan, Hood, with this army, was soon reported tothe south-west of Atlanta. Moving far to Sherman's right, he succeededin reaching the railroad about Big Shanty, and moved north on it.General Sherman, leaving a force to hold Atlanta, with the remainder ofhis army fell upon him and drove him to Gadsden, Alabama. Seeing theconstant annoyance he would have with the roads to his rear if heattempted to hold Atlanta, General Sherman proposed the abandonment anddestruction of that place, with all the railroads leading to it, andtelegraphed me as follows:'CENTREVILLE, GEORGIA', October 10--noon.'Dispatch about Wilson just received.  Hood is now crossing Coosa River,twelve miles below Rome, bound west.  If he passes over the Mobile andOhio road, had I not better execute the plan of my letter sent byColonel Porter, and leave General Thomas with the troops now inTennessee to defend the State?  He will have an ample force when thereinforcements ordered reach Nashville.'W. T. SHERMAN, Major-General.'LIEUTENANT-GENERAL GRANT.'For a full understanding of the plan referred to in this dispatch, Iquote from the letter sent by Colonel Porter:'I will therefore give my opinion, that your army and Canby's should bereinforced to the maximum; that after you get Wilmington, you strike forSavannah and the river; that Canby be instructed to hold the MississippiRiver, and send a force to get Columbus, Georgia, either by the way ofthe Alabama or the Appalachicola, and that I keep Hood employed and putmy army in final order for a march on Augusta, Columbia, and Charleston,to be ready as soon as Wilmington is sealed as to commerce and the cityof Savannah is in our possession.'  This was in reply to a letter ofmine of date September 12th, in answer to a dispatch of his containingsubstantially the same proposition, and in which I informed him of aproposed movement against Wilmington, and of the situation in Virginia,etc.'CITY POINT, VIRGINIA,'October 11, 1864--11 A.M.'Your dispatch of October 10th received.  Does it not look as if Hoodwas going to attempt the invasion of Middle Tennessee, using the Mobileand Ohio and Memphis and Charleston roads to supply his base on theTennessee River, about Florence or Decatur?  If he does this, he oughtto be met and prevented from getting north of the Tennessee River.  Ifyou were to cut loose, I do not believe you would meet Hood's army, butwould be bushwhacked by all the old men and little boys, and suchrailroad guards as are still left at home.  Hood would probably strikefor Nashville, thinking that by going north he could inflict greaterdamage upon us than we could upon the rebels by going south.  If thereis any way of getting at Hood's army, I would prefer that, but I musttrust to your own judgment.  I find I shall not be able to send a forcefrom here to act with you on Savannah. Your movements, therefore, willbe independent of mine; at least until the fall of Richmond takes place.I am afraid Thomas, with such lines of road as he has to protect, couldnot prevent Hood from going north.  With Wilson turned loose, with allyour cavalry, you will find the rebels put much more on the defensivethan heretofore.'U. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General.'MAJOR-GENERAL W. T. SHERMAN.''KINGSTON, GEORGIA, 'October 11--11 A.M.'Hood moved his army from Palmetto Station across by Dallas andCedartown, and is now on the Coosa River, south of Rome.  He threw onecorps on my road at Acworth, and I was forced to follow.  I hold Atlantawith the 20th corps, and have strong detachments along my line.  Thisreduces my active force to a comparatively small army.  We cannot remainhere on the defensive.  With the twenty-five thousand men, and the boldcavalry he has, he can constantly break my roads.  I would infinitelyprefer to make a wreck of the road, and of the country from Chattanoogato Atlanta including the latter city send back all my wounded andworthless, and with my effective army, move through Georgia, smashingthings, to the sea. Hood may turn into Tennessee and Kentucky, but Ibelieve he will be forced to follow me.  Instead of my being on thedefensive, I would be on the offensive; instead of guessing at what hemeans to do, he would have to guess at my plans.  The difference in waris full twenty-five per cent.  I can make Savannah, Charleston, or themouth of the Chattahoochee.'Answer quick, as I know we will not have the telegraph long.'W. T. SHERMAN, Major-General.'LIEUTENANT-GENERAL GRANT.''CITY POINT, VIRGINIA, 'October 11,1864--11.30 P.M.'Your dispatch of to-day received.  If you are satisfied the trip to thesea-coast can be made, holding the line of the Tennessee River firmly,you may make it, destroying all the railroad south of Dalton orChattanooga, as you think best.'U. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General.'MAJOR-GENERAL W. T. SHERMAN.'It was the original design to hold Atlanta, and by getting through tothe coast, with a garrison left on the southern railroads, leading eastand west, through Georgia, to effectually sever the east from the west.In other words, cut the would-be Confederacy in two again, as it hadbeen cut once by our gaining possession of the Mississippi River.General Sherman's plan virtually effected this object.General Sherman commenced at once his preparations for his proposedmovement, keeping his army in position in the meantime to watch Hood.Becoming satisfied that Hood had moved westward from Gadsden across SandMountain, General Sherman sent the 4th corps,  Major-General Stanleycommanding, and the 23d corps, Major-General Schofield commanding, backto Chattanooga to report to Major-General Thomas, at Nashville, whom hehad placed in command of all the troops of his military division, savethe four army corps and cavalry division he designed to move withthrough Georgia. With the troops thus left at his disposal, there waslittle doubt that General Thomas could hold the line of the Tennessee,or, in the event Hood should force it, would be able to concentrate andbeat him in battle.  It was therefore readily consented to that Shermanshould start for the sea-coast.Having concentrated his troops at Atlanta by the 14th of November, hecommenced his march, threatening both Augusta and Macon.  His coming-outpoint could not be definitely fixed. Having to gather his subsistence ashe marched through the country, it was not impossible that a forceinferior to his own might compel him to head for such point as he couldreach, instead of such as he might prefer.  The blindness of the enemy,however, in ignoring his movement, and sending Hood's army, the onlyconsiderable force he had west of Richmond and east of the MississippiRiver, northward on an offensive campaign, left the whole country open,and Sherman's route to his own choice.How that campaign was conducted, how little opposition was met with, thecondition of the country through which the armies passed, the capture ofFort McAllister, on the Savannah River, and the occupation of Savannahon the 21st of December, are all clearly set forth in General Sherman'sadmirable report.Soon after General Sherman commenced his march from Atlanta, twoexpeditions, one from Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and one from Vicksburg,Mississippi, were started by General Canby to cut the enemy's lines ofcommunication with Mobile and detain troops in that field.  GeneralFoster, commanding Department of the South, also sent an expedition, viaBroad River, to destroy the railroad between Charleston and Savannah.The expedition from Vicksburg, under command of Brevet Brigadier-GeneralE. D. Osband (colonel 3d United States colored cavalry), captured, onthe 27th of November, and destroyed the Mississippi Central Railroadbridge and trestle-work over Big Black River, near Canton, thirty milesof the road, and two locomotives, besides large amounts of stores.  Theexpedition from Baton Rouge was without favorable results.  Theexpedition from the Department of the South, under the immediate commandof Brigadier-General John P. Hatch, consisting of about five thousandmen of all arms, including a brigade from the navy, proceeded up BroadRiver and debarked at Boyd's Neck on the 29th of November, from where itmoved to strike the railroad at Grahamsville.  At Honey Hill, aboutthree miles from Grahamsville, the enemy was found and attacked in astrongly fortified position, which resulted, after severe fighting, inour repulse with a loss of seven hundred and forty-six in killed,wounded, and missing.  During the night General Hatch withdrew.  On the6th of December General Foster obtained a position covering theCharleston and Savannah Railroad, between the Coosawhatchie andTulifinny rivers.Hood, instead of following Sherman, continued his move northward, whichseemed to me to be leading to his certain doom.  At all events, had Ihad the power to command both armies, I should not have changed theorders under which he seemed to be acting.  On the 26th of October, theadvance of Hood's army attacked the garrison at Decatur, Alabama, butfailing to carry the place, withdrew towards Courtland, and succeeded,in the face of our cavalry, in effecting a lodgment on the north side ofthe Tennessee River, near Florence.  On the 28th, Forrest reached theTennessee, at Fort Heiman, and captured a gunboat and three transports.On the 2d of November he planted batteries above and below Johnsonville,on the opposite side of the river, isolating three gunboats and eighttransports.  On the 4th the enemy opened his batteries upon the place,and was replied to from the gunboats and the garrison.  The gunboatsbecoming disabled were set on fire, as also were the transports, toprevent their falling into the hands of the enemy.  About a million anda half dollars' worth of store and property on the levee and instorehouses was consumed by fire.  On the 5th the enemy disappeared andcrossed to the north side of the Tennessee River, above Johnsonville,moving towards Clifton, and subsequently joined Hood.  On the night ofthe 5th, General Schofield, with the advance of the 23d corps, reachedJohnsonville, but finding the enemy gone, was ordered to Pulaski, andwas put in command of all the troopers there, with instruction to watchthe movements of Hood and retard his advance, but not to risk a generalengagement until the arrival of General A. J. Smith's command fromMissouri, and until General Wilson could get his cavalry remounted.On the 19th, General Hood continued his advance.  General Thomas,retarding him as much as possible, fell back towards Nashville for thepurpose of concentrating his command and gaining time for the arrival ofreinforcements.  The enemy coming up with our main force, commanded byGeneral Schofield, at Franklin, on the 30th, assaulted our worksrepeatedly during the afternoon until late at night, but were in everyinstance repulsed.  His loss in this battle was one thousand sevenhundred and fifty killed, seven hundred and two prisoners, and threethousand eight hundred wounded.  Among his losses were six generalofficers killed, six wounded, and one captured.  Our entire loss was twothousand three hundred.  This was the first serious opposition the enemymet with, and I am satisfied was the fatal blow to all his expectations.During the night, General Schofield fell back towards Nashville.  Thisleft the field to the enemy--not lost by battle, but voluntarilyabandoned--so that General Thomas's whole force might be broughttogether.  The enemy followed up and commenced the establishment of hisline in front of Nashville on the 2d of December.As soon as it was ascertained that Hood was crossing the TennesseeRiver, and that Price was going out of Missouri, General Rosecrans wasordered to send to General Thomas the troops of General A. J. Smith'scommand, and such other troops as he could spare.  The advance of thisreinforcement reached Nashville on the 30th of November.On the morning of the 15th December, General Thomas attacked Hood inposition, and, in a battle lasting two days, defeated and drove him fromthe field in the utmost confusion, leaving in our hand most of hisartillery and many thousand prisoners, including four general officers.Before the battle of Nashville I grew very impatient over, as itappeared to me, the unnecessary delay.  This impatience was increasedupon learning that the enemy had sent a force of cavalry across theCumberland into Kentucky.  I feared Hood would cross his whole army andgive us great trouble there. After urging upon General Thomas thenecessity of immediately assuming the offensive, I started West tosuperintend matters there in person.  Reaching Washington City, Ireceived General Thomas's dispatch announcing his attack upon the enemy,and the result as far as the battle had progressed.  I was delighted.All fears and apprehensions were dispelled.  I am not yet satisfied butthat General Thomas, immediately upon the appearance of Hood beforeNashville, and before he had time to fortify, should have moved out withhis whole force and given him battle, instead of waiting to remount hiscavalry, which delayed him until the inclemency of the weather made itimpracticable to attack earlier than he did.  But his final defeat ofHood was so complete, that it will be accepted as a vindication of thatdistinguished officer's judgment.After Hood's defeat at Nashville he retreated, closely pursued bycavalry and infantry, to the Tennessee River, being forced to abandonmany pieces of artillery and most of his transportation.  On the 28th ofDecember our advanced forces ascertained that he had made good hisescape to the south side of the river.About this time, the rains having set in heavily in Tennessee and NorthAlabama, making it difficult to move army transportation and artillery,General Thomas stopped the pursuit by his main force at the TennesseeRiver.  A small force of cavalry, under Colonel W. J. Palmer, 15thPennsylvania Volunteers, continued to follow Hood for some distance,capturing considerable transportation and all the enemy'spontoon-bridge.  The details of these operations will be foundclearly set forth in General Thomas's report.A cavalry expedition, under Brevet Major-General Grierson, started fromMemphis on the 21st of December.  On the 25th he surprised and capturedForrest's dismounted camp at Verona, Mississippi, on the Mobile and OhioRailroad, destroyed the railroad, sixteen cars loaded with wagons andpontoons for Hood's army, four thousand new English carbines, and largeamounts of public stores.  On the morning of the 28th he attacked andcaptured a force of the enemy at Egypt, and destroyed a train offourteen cars; thence turning to the south-west, he struck theMississippi Central Railroad at Winona, destroyed the factories andlarge amounts of stores at Bankston, and the machine-shops and publicproperty at Grenada, arriving at Vicksburg January 5th.During the operations in Middle Tennessee, the enemy, with a force underGeneral Breckinridge, entered East Tennessee.  On the 13th of Novemberhe attacked General Gillem, near Morristown, capturing his artillery andseveral hundred prisoners.  Gillem, with what was left of his command,retreated to Knoxville.  Following up his success, Breckinridge moved tonear Knoxville, but withdrew on the 18th, followed by General Ammen.Under the directions of General Thomas, General Stoneman concentratedthe commands of Generals Burbridge and Gillem near Bean's Station tooperate against Breckinridge, and destroy or drive him into Virginia--destroy the salt-works at Saltville, and the railroad into Virginiaas far as he could go without endangering his command.  On the 12th ofDecember he commenced his movement, capturing and dispersing the enemy'sforces wherever he met them.  On the 16th he struck the enemy, underVaughn, at Marion, completely routing and pursuing him to Wytheville,capturing all his artillery, trains, and one hundred and ninety-eightprisoners; and destroyed Wytheville, with its stores and supplies, andthe extensive lead-works near there. Returning to Marion, he met a forceunder Breckinridge, consisting, among other troops, of the garrison ofSaltville, that had started in pursuit.  He at once made arrangements toattack it the next morning; but morning found Breckinridge gone.  Hethen moved directly to Saltville, and destroyed the extensive salt-worksat that place, a large amount of stores, and captured eight pieces ofartillery.  Having thus successfully executed his instructions, hereturned General Burbridge to Lexington and General Gillem to Knoxville.Wilmington, North Carolina, was the most important sea-coast port leftto the enemy through which to get supplies from abroad, and send cottonand other products out by blockade-runners, besides being a place ofgreat strategic value.  The navy had been making strenuous exertions toseal the harbor of Wilmington, but with only partial effect.  The natureof the outlet of Cape Fear River was such, that it required watching forso great a distance that, without possession of the land north of NewInlet, or Fort Fisher, it was impossible for the navy to entirely closethe harbor against the entrance of blockade-runners.To secure the possession of this land required the co-operation of aland force, which I agreed to furnish.  Immediately commenced theassemblage in Hampton Roads, under Admiral D. D. Porter, of the mostformidable armada ever collected for concentration upon one given point.This necessarily attracted the attention of the enemy, as well as thatof the loyal North; and through the imprudence of the public press, andvery likely of officers of both branches of service, the exact object ofthe expedition became a subject of common discussion in the newspapersboth North and South.  The enemy, thus warned, prepared to meet it.This caused a postponement of the expedition until the later part ofNovember, when, being again called upon by Hon. G. V. Fox, AssistantSecretary of the Navy, I agreed to furnish the men required at once, andwent myself, in company with Major-General Butler, to Hampton Roads,where we had a conference with Admiral Porter as to the force requiredand the time of starting.  A force of six thousand five hundred men wasregarded as sufficient.  The time of starting was not definitelyarranged, but it was thought all would be ready by the 6th of December,if not before.  Learning, on the 30th of November, that Bragg had goneto Georgia, taking with him most of the forces about Wilmington, Ideemed it of the utmost importance that the expedition should reach itsdestination before the return of Bragg, and directed General Butler tomake all arrangements for the departure of Major-General Weitzel, whohad been designated to command the land forces, so that the navy mightnot be detained one moment.On the 6th of December, the following instructions were given:'CITY POINT, VIRGINIA, December 6, 1864.'GENERAL:  The first object of the expedition under General Weitzel isto close to the enemy the port of Wilmington.  If successful in this,the second will be to capture Wilmington itself.  There are reasonablegrounds to hope for success, if advantage can be taken of the absence ofthe greater part of the enemy's forces now looking after Sherman inGeorgia.  The directions you have given for the numbers and equipment ofthe expedition are all right, except in the unimportant matter of wherethey embark and the amount of intrenching tools to be taken.  The objectof the expedition will be gained by effecting a landing on the main landbetween Cape Fear River and the Atlantic, north of the north entrance tothe river.  Should such landing be effected while the enemy still holdsFort Fisher and the batteries guarding the entrance to the river, thenthe troops should intrench themselves, and, by co-operating with thenavy, effect the reduction and capture of those places.  These in ourhands, the navy could enter the harbor, and the port of Wilmington wouldbe sealed.  Should Fort Fisher and the point of land on which it isbuilt fall into the hands of our troops immediately on landing, then itwill be worth the attempt to capture Wilmington by a forced march andsurprise.  If time is consumed in gaining the first object of theexpedition, the second will become a matter of after consideration.'The details for execution are intrusted to you and the officerimmediately in command of the troops.'Should the troops under General Weitzel fail to effect a landing at ornear Fort Fisher, they will be returned to the armies operating againstRichmond without delay.'U. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General.'MAJOR-GENERAL B. F. BUTLER.'General Butler commanding the army from which the troops were taken forthis enterprise, and the territory within which they were to operate,military courtesy required that all orders and instructions should gothrough him.  They were so sent, but General Weitzel has sinceofficially informed me that he never received the foregoinginstructions, nor was he aware of their existence, until he read GeneralButler's published official report of the Fort Fisher failure, with myindorsement and papers accompanying it.  I had no idea of GeneralButler's accompanying the expedition until the evening before it got offfrom Bermuda Hundred, and then did not dream but that General Weitzelhad received all the instructions, and would be in command.  I ratherformed the idea that General Butler was actuated by a desire to witnessthe effect of the explosion of the powder-boat.  The expedition wasdetained several days at Hampton Roads, awaiting the loading of thepowder-boat.The importance of getting the Wilmington expedition off without anydelay, with or without the powder-boat, had been urged upon GeneralButler, and he advised to so notify Admiral Porter.The expedition finally got off on the 13th of December, and arrived atthe place of rendezvous, off New Inlet, near Fort Fisher, on the eveningof the 15th.  Admiral Porter arrived on the evening of the 18th, havingput in at Beaufort to get ammunition for the monitors.  The sea becomingrough, making it difficult to land troops, and the supply of water andcoal being about exhausted, the transport fleet put back to Beaufort toreplenish; this, with the state of the weather, delayed the return tothe place of rendezvous until the 24th.  The powder-boat was exploded onthe morning of the 24th, before the return of General Butler fromBeaufort; but it would seem, from the notice taken of it in the Southernnewspapers, that the enemy were never enlightened as to the object ofthe explosion until they were informed by the Northern press.On the 25th a landing was effected without opposition, and areconnoissance, under Brevet Brigadier-General Curtis, pushed up towardsthe fort.  But before receiving a full report of the result of thisreconnoissance, General Butler, in direct violation of the instructionsgiven, ordered the re-embarkation of the troops and the return of theexpedition.  The re-embarkation was accomplished by the morning of the27th.On the return of the expedition officers and men among them BrevetMajor-General (then Brevet Brigadier-General) N. M. Curtis,First-Lieutenant G. W. Ross, 117th Regiment New York Volunteers,First-Lieutenant William H. Walling, and Second-Lieutenant GeorgeSimpson, 142d New York Volunteers voluntarily reported to me that whenrecalled they were nearly into the fort, and, in their opinion, it couldhave been taken without much loss.Soon after the return of the expedition, I received a dispatch from theSecretary of the Navy, and a letter from Admiral Porter, informing methat the fleet was still off Fort Fisher, and expressing the convictionthat, under a proper leader, the place could be taken.  The naturalsupposition with me was, that when the troops abandoned the expedition,the navy would do so also.  Finding it had not, however, I answered onthe 30th of December, advising Admiral Porter to hold on, and that Iwould send a force and make another attempt to take the place.  Thistime I selected Brevet Major-General (now Major-General) A. H. Terry tocommand the expedition.  The troops composing it consisted of the samethat composed the former, with the addition of a small brigade,numbering about one thousand five hundred, and a small siege train.  Thelatter it was never found necessary to land.  I communicated direct tothe commander of the expedition the following instructions:'CITY POINT, VIRGINIA, January 3, 1865.'GENERAL:  The expedition intrusted to your command has been fitted outto renew the attempt to capture Fort Fisher, N. C., and Wilmingtonultimately, if the fort falls.  You will then proceed with as littledelay as possible to the naval fleet lying off Cape Fear River, andreport the arrival of yourself and command to Admiral D. D. Porter,commanding North Atlantic Blockading Squadron.'It is exceedingly desirable that the most complete understanding shouldexist between yourself and the naval commander.  I suggest, therefore,that you consult with Admiral Porter freely, and get from him the partto be performed by each branch of the public service, so that there maybe unity of action.  It would be well to have the whole programme laiddown in writing.  I have served with Admiral Porter, and know that youcan rely on his judgment and his nerve to undertake what he proposes.  Iwould, therefore, defer to him as much as is consistent with your ownresponsibilities.  The first object to be attained is to get a firmposition on the spit of land on which Fort Fisher is built, from whichyou can operate against that fort.  You want to look to thepracticability of receiving your supplies, and to defending yourselfagainst superior forces sent against you by any of the avenues left opento the enemy. If such a position can be obtained, the siege of FortFisher will not be abandoned until its reduction is accomplished, oranother plan of campaign is ordered from these headquarters.'My own views are, that if you effect a landing, the navy ought to run aportion of their fleet into Cape Fear River, while the balance of itoperates on the outside.  Land forces cannot invest Fort Fisher, or cutit off from supplies or reinforcements, while the river is in possessionof the enemy.'A siege-train will be loaded on vessels and sent to Fort Monroe, inreadiness to be sent to you if required.  All other supplies can bedrawn from Beaufort as you need them.'Keep the fleet of vessels with you until your position is assured.When you find they can be spared, order them back, or such of them asyou can spare, to Fort Monroe, to report for orders.'In case of failure to effect a landing, bring your command back toBeaufort, and report to these headquarters for further instructions.You will not debark at Beaufort until so directed.'General Sheridan has been ordered to send a division of troops toBaltimore and place them on sea-going vessels.  These troops will bebrought to Fort Monroe and kept there on the vessels until you are heardfrom.  Should you require them, they will be sent to you.'U. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General.'BREVET MAJOR-GENERAL A. H. TERRY.'Lieutenant-Colonel C. B. Comstock, aide-de-camp (now brevetbrigadier-general), who accompanied the former expedition,was assigned, in orders, as chief-engineer to this.It will be seen that these instructions did not differ materially fromthose given for the first expedition, and that in neither instance wasthere an order to assault Fort Fisher. This was a matter left entirelyto the discretion of the commanding officer.The expedition sailed from Fort Monroe on the morning of the 6th,arriving at the rendezvous, off Beaufort, on the 8th, where, owing tothe difficulties of the weather, it lay until the morning of the 12th,when it got under way and reached its destination that evening.  Undercover of the fleet, the disembarkation of the troops commenced on themorning of the 13th, and by three o'clock P.M. was completed withoutloss.  On the 14th a reconnoissance was pushed to within five hundredyards of Fort Fisher, and a small advance work taken possession of andturned into a defensive line against any attempt that might be made fromthe fort.  This reconnoissance disclosed the fact that the front of thework had been seriously injured by the navy fire.  In the afternoon ofthe 15th the fort was assaulted, and after most desperate fighting wascaptured, with its entire garrison and armament.  Thus was secured, bythe combined efforts of the navy and army, one of the most importantsuccesses of the war.  Our loss was:  killed, one hundred and ten;wounded, five hundred and thirty-six.  On the 16th and the 17th theenemy abandoned and blew up Fort Caswell and the works on Smith'sIsland, which were immediately occupied by us.  This gave us entirecontrol of the mouth of the Cape Fear River.At my request, Mayor-General B. F. Butler was relieved, andMajor-General E. O. C. Ord assigned to the Department of Virginia andNorth Carolina.The defence of the line of the Tennessee no longer requiring the forcewhich had beaten and nearly destroyed the only army now threatening it,I determined to find other fields of operation for General Thomas'ssurplus troops--fields from which they would co-operate with othermovements.  General Thomas was therefore directed to collect all troops,not essential to hold his communications at Eastport, in readiness fororders.  On the 7th of January, General Thomas was directed, if he wasassured of the departure of Hood south from Corinth, to send GeneralSchofield with his corps east with as little delay as possible.  Thisdirection was promptly complied with, and the advance of the corpsreached Washington on the 23d of the same month, whence it was sent toFort Fisher and New Bern.  On the 26th he was directed to send GeneralA. J. Smith's command and a division of cavalry to report to GeneralCanby.  By the 7th of February the whole force was en route for itsdestination.The State of North Carolina was constituted into a military department,and General Schofield assigned to command, and placed under the ordersof Major-General Sherman.  The following instructions were given him:'CITY POINT, VA., January 31, 1865.'GENERAL:-- *    *    *    Your movements are intended as co-operativewith Sherman's through the States of South and North Carolina.  Thefirst point to be attained is to secure Wilmington.  Goldsboro' willthen be your objective point, moving either from Wilmington or New Bern,or both, as you deem best.  Should you not be able to reach Goldsboro',you will advance on the line or lines of railway connecting that placewith the sea-coast--as near to it as you can, building the road behindyou.  The enterprise under you has two objects:  the first is to giveGeneral Sherman material aid, if needed, in his march north; the second,to open a base of supplies for him on his line of march.  As soon,therefore, as you can determine which of the two points, Wilmington orNew Bern, you can best use for throwing supplies from, to the interior,you will commence the accumulation of twenty days' rations and foragefor sixty thousand men and twenty thousand animals.  You will get ofthese as many as you can house and protect to such point in the interioras you may be able to occupy.  I believe General Palmer has receivedsome instructions direct from General Sherman on the subject of securingsupplies for his army.  You will learn what steps he has taken, and begoverned in your requisitions accordingly.  A supply of ordnance storeswill also be necessary.'Make all requisitions upon the chiefs of their respective departmentsin the field with me at City Point.  Communicate with me by everyopportunity, and should you deem it necessary at any time, send aspecial boat to Fortress Monroe, from which point you can communicate bytelegraph.'The supplies referred to in these instructions are exclusive of thoserequired for your own command.'The movements of the enemy may justify, or even make it your imperativeduty, to cut loose from your base, and strike for the interior to aidSherman.  In such case you will act on your own judgment without waitingfor instructions.  You will report, however, what you purpose doing.The details for carrying out these instructions are necessarily left toyou.  I would urge, however, if I did not know that you are alreadyfully alive to the importance of it, prompt action.  Sherman may belooked for in the neighborhood of Goldsboro' any time from the 22d tothe 28th of February; this limits your time very materially.'If rolling-stock is not secured in the capture of Wilmington, it can besupplied from Washington.  A large force of railroad men have alreadybeen sent to Beaufort, and other mechanics will go to Fort Fisher in aday or two.  On this point I have informed you by telegraph.'U. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General.'MAJOR-GENERAL J. M. SCHOFIELD.'Previous to giving these instructions I had visited Fort Fisher,accompanied by General Schofield, for the purpose of seeing for myselfthe condition of things, and personally conferring with General Terryand Admiral Porter as to what was best to be done.Anticipating the arrival of General Sherman at Savannah his armyentirely foot-loose, Hood being then before Nashville, Tennessee, theSouthern railroads destroyed, so that it would take several months tore-establish a through line from west to east, and regarding the captureof Lee's army as the most important operation towards closing therebellion--I sent orders to General Sherman on the 6th of December, thatafter establishing a base on the sea-coast, with necessary garrison, toinclude all his artillery and cavalry, to come by water to City Pointwith the balance of his command.On the 18th of December, having received information of the defeat andutter rout of Hood's army by General Thomas, and that, owing to thegreat difficulty of procuring ocean transportation, it would take overtwo months to transport Sherman's army, and doubting whether he mightnot contribute as much towards the desired result by operating fromwhere he was, I wrote to him to that effect, and asked him for his viewsas to what would be best to do.  A few days after this I received acommunication from General Sherman, of date 16th December, acknowledgingthe receipt of my order of the 6th, and informing me of his preparationsto carry it into effect as soon as he could get transportation.  Alsothat he had expected, upon reducing Savannah, instantly to march toColumbia, South Carolina, thence to Raleigh, and thence to report to me;but that this would consume about six weeks' time after the fall ofSavannah, whereas by sea he could probably reach me by the middle ofJanuary.  The confidence he manifested in this letter of being able tomarch up and join me pleased me, and, without waiting for a reply to myletter of the 18th, I directed him, on the 28th of December, to makepreparations to start as he proposed, without delay, to break up therailroads in North and South Carolina, and join the armies operatingagainst Richmond as soon as he could.On the 21st of January I informed General Sherman that I had ordered the23d corps,  Major-General Schofield commanding, east; that it numberedabout twenty-one thousand men; that we had at Fort Fisher, about eightthousand men; at New Bern, about four thousand; that if Wilmington wascaptured, General Schofield would go there; if not, he would be sent toNew Bern; that, in either event, all the surplus force at both pointswould move to the interior towards Goldsboro', in co-operation with hismovement; that from either point railroad communication could be runout; and that all these troops would be subject to his orders as he cameinto communication with them.In obedience to his instructions, General Schofield proceeded to reduceWilmington, North Carolina, in co-operation with the navy under AdmiralPorter, moving his forces up both sides of the Cape Fear River.  FortAnderson, the enemy's main defence on the west bank of the river, wasoccupied on the morning of the 19th, the enemy having evacuated it afterour appearance before it.After fighting on 20th and 21st, our troops entered Wilmington on themorning of the 22d, the enemy having retreated towards Goldsboro' duringthe night.  Preparations were at once made for a movement on Goldsboro'in two columns--one from Wilmington, and the other from New Bern--and torepair the railroad leading there from each place, as well as to supplyGeneral Sherman by Cape Fear River, towards Fayetteville, if it becamenecessary.  The column from New Bern was attacked on the 8th of March,at Wise's Forks, and driven back with the loss of several hundredprisoners.  On the 11th the enemy renewed his attack upon our intrenchedposition, but was repulsed with severe loss, and fell back during thenight.  On the 14th the Neuse River was crossed and Kinston occupied,and on the 21st Goldsboro' was entered. The column from Wilmingtonreached Cox's Bridge, on the Neuse River, ten miles above Goldsboro', onthe 22d.By the 1st of February, General Sherman's whole army was in motion fromSavannah.  He captured Columbia, South Carolina, on the 17th; thencemoved on Goldsboro', North Carolina, via Fayetteville, reaching thelatter place on the 12th of March, opening up communication with GeneralSchofield by way of Cape Fear River.  On the 15th he resumed his marchon Goldsboro'.  He met a force of the enemy at Averysboro', and after asevere fight defeated and compelled it to retreat.  Our loss in thisengagement was about six hundred.  The enemy's loss was much greater.On the 18th the combined forces of the enemy, under Joe Johnston,attacked his advance at Bentonville, capturing three guns and driving itback upon the main body.  General Slocum, who was in the advanceascertaining that the whole of Johnston's army was in the front,arranged his troops on the defensive, intrenched himself and awaitedreinforcements, which were pushed forward.  On the night of the 21st theenemy retreated to Smithfield, leaving his dead and wounded in ourhands.  From there Sherman continued to Goldsboro', which place had beenoccupied by General Schofield on the 21st (crossing the Neuse River tenmiles above there, at Cox's Bridge, where General Terry had gotpossession and thrown a pontoon-bridge on the 22d), thus forming ajunction with the columns from New Bern and Wilmington.Among the important fruits of this campaign was the fall of Charleston,South Carolina. It was evacuated by the enemy on the night of the 17thof February, and occupied by our forces on the 18th.On the morning of the 31st of January, General Thomas was directed tosend a cavalry expedition, under General Stoneman, from East Tennessee,to penetrate South Carolina well down towards Columbia, to destroy therailroads and military resources of the country, and return, if he wasable, to East Tennessee by way of Salisbury, North Carolina, releasingour prisoners there, if possible.  Of the feasibility of this latter,however, General Stoneman was to judge.  Sherman's movements, I had nodoubt, would attract the attention of all the force the enemy couldcollect, and facilitate the execution of this.  General Stoneman was solate in making his start on this expedition (and Sherman having passedout of the State of South Carolina), on the 27th of February I directedGeneral Thomas to change his course, and order him to repeat his raid oflast fall, destroying the railroad towards Lynchburg as far as he could.This would keep him between our garrisons in East Tennessee and theenemy.  I regarded it not impossible that in the event of the enemybeing driven from Richmond, he might fall back to Lynchburg and attempta raid north through East Tennessee.  On the 14th of February thefollowing communication was sent to General Thomas:'CITY POINT, VA., February 14, 1865.'General Canby is preparing a movement from Mobile Bay against Mobileand the interior of Alabama. His force will consist of about twentythousand men, besides A. J. Smith's command.  The cavalry you have sentto Canby will be debarked at Vicksburg. It, with the available cavalryalready in that section, will move from there eastward, in co-operation.Hood's army has been terribly reduced by the severe punishment you gaveit in Tennessee, by desertion consequent upon their defeat, and now bythe withdrawal of many of them to oppose Sherman.  (I take it a largeportion of the infantry has been so withdrawn.  It is so asserted in theRichmond papers, and a member of the rebel Congress said a few dayssince in a speech, that one-half of it had been brought to SouthCarolina to oppose Sherman.)  This being true, or even if it is nottrue, Canby's movement will attract all the attention of the enemy, andleave the advance from your standpoint easy.  I think it advisable,therefore, that you prepare as much of a cavalry force as you can spare,and hold it in readiness to go south.  The object would be threefold:first, to attract as much of the enemy's force as possible, to insuresuccess to Canby; second, to destroy the enemy's line of communicationsand military resources; third, to destroy or capture their forcesbrought into the field. Tuscaloosa and Selma would probably be thepoints to direct the expedition against.  This, however, would not be soimportant as the mere fact of penetrating deep into Alabama.  Discretionshould be left to the officer commanding the expedition to go where,according to the information he may receive, he will best secure theobjects named above.'Now that your force has been so much depleted, I do not know whatnumber of men you can put into the field.  If not more than fivethousand men, however, all cavalry, I think it will be sufficient.  Itis not desirable that you should start this expedition until the oneleaving Vicksburg has been three or four days out, or even a week.  I donot know when it will start, but will inform you by telegraph as soon asI learn.  If you should hear through other sources before hearing fromme, you can act on the information received.'To insure success your cavalry should go with as little wagon-train aspossible, relying upon the country for supplies.  I would also reducethe number of guns to a battery, or the number of batteries, and put theextra teams to the guns taken.  No guns or caissons should be taken withless than eight horses.'Please inform me by telegraph, on receipt of this, what force you thinkyou will be able to send under these directions.'U. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General.'MAJOR-GENERAL G. H. THOMAS.'On the 15th, he was directed to start the expedition as soon after the20th as he could get it off.I deemed it of the utmost importance, before a general movement of thearmies operating against Richmond, that all communications with thecity, north of James River, should be cut off.  The enemy havingwithdrawn the bulk of his force from the Shenandoah Valley and sent itsouth, or replaced troops sent from Richmond, and desiring to reinforceSherman, if practicable, whose cavalry was greatly inferior in numbersto that of the enemy, I determined to make a move from the Shenandoah,which, if successful, would accomplish the first at least, and possiblythe latter of the objects.  I therefore telegraphed General Sheridan asfollows:'CITY POINT, VA., February 20, 1865--1 P.M.'GENERAL:--As soon as it is possible to travel, I think you will have nodifficulty about reaching Lynchburg with a cavalry force alone.  Fromthere you could destroy the railroad and canal in every direction, so asto be of no further use to the rebellion.  Sufficient cavalry should beleft behind to look after Mosby's gang.  From Lynchburg, if informationyou might get there would justify it, you will strike south, heading thestreams in Virgina to the westward of Danville, and push on and joinGeneral Sherman.  This additional raid, with one now about starting fromEast Tennessee under Stoneman, numbering four or give thousand cavalry,one from Vicksburg, numbering seven or eight thousand cavalry, one fromEastport, Mississippi, then thousand cavalry, Canby from Mobile Bay,with about thirty-eight thousand mixed troops, these three latterpushing for Tuscaloosa, Selma, and Montgomery, and Sherman with a largearmy eating out the vitals of South Carolina, is all that will be wantedto leave nothing for the rebellion to stand upon.  I would advise you toovercome great obstacles to accomplish this.  Charleston was evacuatedon Tuesday 1st.'U. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General.'MAJOR-GENERAL P. H. SHERIDAN.'On the 25th I received a dispatch from General Sheridan, inquiring whereSherman was aiming for, and if I could give him definite information asto the points he might be expected to move on, this side of Charlotte,North Carolina.  In answer, the following telegram was sent him:'CITY POINT, VA., February 25, 1865.'GENERAL:--Sherman's movements will depend on the amount of oppositionhe meets with from the enemy.  If strongly opposed, he may possibly haveto fall back to Georgetown, S. C., and fit out for a new start.  Ithink, however, all danger for the necessity of going to that point haspassed.  I believe he has passed Charlotte.  He may take Fayetteville onhis way to Goldsboro'.  If you reach Lynchburg, you will have to beguided in your after movements by the information you obtain.  Beforeyou could possibly reach Sherman, I think you would find him moving fromGoldsboro' towards Raleigh, or engaging the enemy strongly posted at oneor the other of these places, with railroad communications opened fromhis army to Wilmington or New Bern.'U. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General.'MAJOR-GENERAL P. H. SHERIDAN.'General Sheridan moved from Winchester on the 27th of February, with twodivisions of cavalry, numbering about five thousand each.  On the 1st ofMarch he secured the bridge, which the enemy attempted to destroy,across the middle fork of the Shenandoah, at Mount Crawford, and enteredStaunton on the 2d, the enemy having retreated to Waynesboro'.  Thencehe pushed on to Waynesboro', where he found the enemy in force in anintrenched position, under General Early.  Without stopping to make areconnoissance, an immediate attack was made, the position was carried,and sixteen hundred prisoners, eleven pieces of artillery, with horsesand caissons complete, two hundred wagons and teams loaded withsubsistence, and seventeen battle-flags, were captured.  The prisoners,under an escort of fifteen hundred men, were sent back to Winchester.Thence he marched on Charlottesville, destroying effectually therailroad and bridges as he went, which place he reached on the 3d.  Herehe remained two days, destroying the railroad towards Richmond andLynchburg, including the large iron bridges over the north and southforks of the Rivanna River and awaited the arrival of his trains.  Thisnecessary delay caused him to abandon the idea of capturing Lynchburg.On the morning of the 6th, dividing his force into two columns, he sentone to Scottsville, whence it marched up the James River Canal to NewMarket, destroying every lock, and in many places the bank of the canal.From here a force was pushed out from this column to Duiguidsville, toobtain possession of the bridge across the James River at that place,but failed.  The enemy burned it on our approach.  The enemy also burnedthe bridge across the river at Hardwicksville.  The other column moveddown the railroad towards Lynchburg, destroying it as far as AmherstCourt House, sixteen miles from Lynchburg; thence across the country,uniting with the column at New Market.  The river being very high, hispontoons would not reach across it; and the enemy having destroyed thebridges by which he had hoped to cross the river and get on the SouthSide Railroad about Farmville, and destroy it to Appomattox Court House,the only thing left for him was to return to Winchester or strike a baseat the White House. Fortunately, he chose the latter.  From New Markethe took up his line of march, following the canal towards Richmond,destroying every lock upon it and cutting the banks whereverpracticable, to a point eight miles east of Goochland, concentrating thewhole force at Columbia on the 10th.  Here he rested one day, and sentthrough by scouts information of his whereabouts and purposes, and arequest for supplies to meet him at White House, which reached me on thenight of the 12th.  An infantry force was immediately sent to getpossession of White House, and supplies were forwarded.  Moving fromColumbia in a direction to threaten Richmond, to near Ashland Station,he crossed the Annas, and after having destroyed all the bridges andmany miles of the railroad, proceeded down the north bank of thePamunkey to White House, which place he reached on the 19th.Previous to this the following communication was sent to General Thomas:'CITY POINT, VIRGINIA, March 7, 1865--9.30 A.M.'GENERAL:--I think it will be advisable now for you to repair therailroad in East Tennessee, and throw a good force up to Bull's Gap andfortify there.  Supplies at Knoxville could always be got forward asrequired.  With Bull's Gap fortified, you can occupy as outposts aboutall of East Tennessee, and be prepared, if it should be required of youin the spring, to make a campaign towards Lynchburg, or into NorthCarolina.  I do not think Stoneman should break the road until he getsinto Virginia, unless it should be to cut off rolling-stock that may becaught west of that.'U. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General.'MAJOR-GENERAL G. H. THOMAS.'Thus it will be seen that in March, 1865, General Canby was moving anadequate force against Mobile and the army defending it under GeneralDick Taylor; Thomas was pushing out two large and well-appointed cavalryexpeditions--one from Middle Tennessee under Brevet Major-General Wilsonagainst the enemy's vital points in Alabama, the other from EastTennessee, under Major-General Stoneman, towards Lynchburg--andassembling the remainder of his available forces, preparatory tocommence offensive operations from East Tennessee; General Sheridan'scavalry was at White House; the armies of the Potomac and James wereconfronting the enemy, under Lee, in his defences of Richmond andPetersburg; General Sherman with his armies, reinforced by that ofGeneral Schofield, was at Goldsboro'; General Pope was makingpreparations for a spring campaign against the enemy under Kirby Smithand Price, west of the Mississippi; and General Hancock wasconcentrating a force in the vicinity of Winchester, Virginia, to guardagainst invasion or to operate offensively, as might prove necessary.After the long march by General Sheridan's cavalry over winter roads, itwas necessary to rest and refit at White House.  At this time thegreatest source of uneasiness to me was the fear that the enemy wouldleave his strong lines about Petersburg and Richmond for the purpose ofuniting with Johnston, and before he was driven from them by battle, orI was prepared to make an effectual pursuit.  On the 24th of March,General Sheridan moved from White House, crossed the James River atJones's Landing, and formed a junction with the Army of the Potomac infront of Petersburg on the 27th.  During this move, General Ord sentforces to cover the crossings of the Chickahominy.On the 24th of March the following instructions for a general movementof the armies operating against Richmond were issued:'CITY POINT, VIRGINIA, March 24, 1865.'GENERAL:  On the 29th instant the armies operating against Richmondwill be moved by our left, for the double purpose of turning the enemyout of his present position around Petersburg, and to insure the successof the cavalry under General Sheridan, which will start at the sametime, in its efforts to reach and destroy the South Side and Danvillerailroads.  Two corps of the Army of the Potomac will be moved at firstin two columns, taking the two roads crossing Hatcher's Run, nearestwhere the present line held by us strikes that stream, both movingtowards Dinwiddie Court House.'The cavalry under General Sheridan, joined by the division now underGeneral Davies, will move at the same time by the Weldon Road and theJerusalem Plank Road, turning west from the latter before crossing theNottoway, and west with the whole column before reaching Stony Creek.General Sheridan will then move independently, under other instructionswhich will be given him.  All dismounted cavalry belonging to the Armyof the Potomac, and the dismounted cavalry from the Middle MilitaryDivision not required for guarding property belonging to their arm ofservice, will report to Brigadier-General Benham, to be added to thedefences of City Point.  Major-General Parke will be left in command ofall the army left for holding the lines about Petersburg and City Point,subject of course to orders from the commander of the Army of thePotomac.  The 9th army corps will be left intact, to hold the presentline of works so long as the whole line now occupied by us is held.  If,however, the troops to the left of the 9th corps are withdrawn, then theleft of the corps may be thrown back so as to occupy the position heldby the army prior to the capture of the Weldon Road.  All troops to theleft of the 9th corps will be held in readiness to move at the shortestnotice by such route as may be designated when the order is given.'General Ord will detach three divisions, two white and one colored, orso much of them as he can, and hold his present lines, and march for thepresent left of the Army of the Potomac.  In the absence of furtherorders, or until further orders are given, the white divisions willfollow the left column of the Army of the Potomac, and the coloreddivision the right column.  During the movement Major-General Weitzelwill be left in command of all the forces remaining behind from the Armyof the James.'The movement of troops from the Army of the James will commence on thenight of the 27th instant.  General Ord will leave behind the minimumnumber of cavalry necessary for picket duty, in the absence of the mainarmy.  A cavalry expedition, from General Ord's command, will also bestarted from Suffolk, to leave there on Saturday, the 1st of April,under Colonel Sumner, for the purpose of cutting the railroad aboutHicksford.  This, if accomplished, will have to be a surprise, andtherefore from three to five hundred men will be sufficient.  Theyshould, however, be supported by all the infantry that can be sparedfrom Norfolk and Portsmouth, as far out as to where the cavalry crossesthe Blackwater.  The crossing should probably be at Uniten.  ShouldColonel Sumner succeed in reaching the Weldon Road, he will beinstructed to do all the damage possible to the triangle of roadsbetween Hicksford, Weldon, and Gaston.  The railroad bridge at Weldonbeing fitted up for the passage of carriages, it might be practicable todestroy any accumulation of supplies the enemy may have collected southof the Roanoke. All the troops will move with four days' rations inhaversacks and eight days' in wagons.  To avoid as much hauling aspossible, and to give the Army of the James the same number of days'supplies with the Army of the Potomac, General Ord will direct hiscommissary and quartermaster to have sufficient supplies delivered atthe terminus of the road to fill up in passing.  Sixty rounds ofammunition per man will be taken in wagons, and as much grain as thetransportation on hand will carry, after taking the specified amount ofother supplies.  The densely wooded country in which the army has tooperate making the use of much artillery impracticable, the amount takenwith the army will be reduced to six or eight guns to each division, atthe option of the army commanders.'All necessary preparations for carrying these directions into operationmay be commenced at once.  The reserves of the 9th corps should bemassed as much as possible.  While I would not now order anunconditional attack on the enemy's line by them, they should be readyand should make the attack if the enemy weakens his line in their front,without waiting for orders.  In case they carry the line, then the wholeof the 9th corps could follow up so as to join or co-operate with thebalance of the army.  To prepare for this, the 9th corps will haverations issued to them, same as the balance of the army.  GeneralWeitzel will keep vigilant watch upon his front, and if found at allpracticable to break through at any point, he will do so.  A successnorth of the James should be followed up with great promptness.  Anattack will not be feasible unless it is found that the enemy hasdetached largely.  In that case it may be regarded as evident that theenemy are relying upon their local reserves principally for the defenceof Richmond.  Preparations may be made for abandoning all the line northof the James, except inclosed works only to be abandoned, however, aftera break is made in the lines of the enemy.'By these instructions a large part of the armies operating againstRichmond is left behind.  The enemy, knowing this, may, as an onlychance, strip their lines to the merest skeleton, in the hope ofadvantage not being taken of it, while they hurl everything against themoving column, and return.  It cannot be impressed too strongly uponcommanders of troops left in the trenches not to allow this to occurwithout taking advantage of it.  The very fact of the enemy coming outto attack, if he does so, might be regarded as almost conclusiveevidence of such a weakening of his lines.  I would have it particularlyenjoined upon corps commanders that, in case of an attack from theenemy, those not attacked are not to wait for orders from the commandingofficer of the army to which they belong, but that they will movepromptly, and notify the commander of their action.  I would also enjointhe same action on the part of division commanders when other parts oftheir corps are engaged.  In like manner, I would urge the importance offollowing up a repulse of the enemy.'U. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General.'MAJOR-GENERALS MEADE, ORD, AND SHERIDAN.'Early on the morning of the 25th the enemy assaulted our lines in frontof the 9th corps (which held from the Appomattox River towards ourleft), and carried Fort Stedman, and a part of the line to the right andleft of it, established themselves and turned the guns of the fortagainst us, but our troops on either flank held their ground until thereserves were brought up, when the enemy was driven back with a heavyloss in killed and wounded, and one thousand nine hundred prisoners.Our loss was sixty-eight killed, three hundred and thirty-seven wounded,and five hundred and six missing.  General Meade at once ordered theother corps to advance and feel the enemy in their respective fronts.Pushing forward, they captured and held the enemy's strongly intrenchedpicket-line in front of the 2d and 6th corps, and eight hundred andthirty-four prisoners.  The enemy made desperate attempts to retake thisline, but without success.  Our loss in front of these was fifty-twokilled, eight hundred and sixty-four wounded, and two hundred and sevenmissing.  The enemy's loss in killed and wounded was far greater.General Sherman having got his troops all quietly in camp aboutGoldsboro', and his preparations for furnishing supplies to themperfected, visited me at City Point on the 27th of March, and statedthat he would be ready to move, as he had previously written me, by the10th of April, fully equipped and rationed for twenty days, if it shouldbecome necessary to bring his command to bear against Lee's army, inco-operation with our forces in front of Richmond and Petersburg.General Sherman proposed in this movement to threaten Raleigh, and then,by turning suddenly to the right, reach the Roanoke at Gaston orthereabouts, whence he could move on to the Richmond and DanvilleRailroad, striking it in the vicinity of Burkesville, or join the armiesoperating against Richmond, as might be deemed best.  This plan he wasdirected to carry into execution, if he received no further directionsin the meantime.  I explained to him the movement I had ordered tocommence on the 29th of March.  That if it should not prove as entirelysuccessful as I hoped, I would cut the cavalry loose to destroy theDanville and South Side railroads, and thus deprive the enemy of furthersupplies, and also to prevent the rapid concentration of Lee's andJohnston's armies.I had spent days of anxiety lest each morning should bring the reportthat the enemy had retreated the night before.  I was firmly convincedthat Sherman's crossing the Roanoke would be the signal for Lee toleave.  With Johnston and him combined, a long, tedious, and expensivecampaign, consuming most of the summer, might become necessary.  Bymoving out I would put the army in better condition for pursuit, andwould at least, by the destruction of the Danville Road, retard theconcentration of the two armies of Lee and Johnston, and cause the enemyto abandon much material that he might otherwise save.  I thereforedetermined not to delay the movement ordered.On the night of the 27th, Major-General Ord, with two divisions of the24th corps, Major-General Gibbon commanding, and one division of the25th corps, Brigadier-General Birney commanding, and MacKenzie'scavalry, took up his line of march in pursuance of the foregoinginstructions, and reached the position assigned him near Hatcher's Runon the morning of the 29th.  On the 28th the following instructions weregiven to General Sheridan:'CITY POINT, VA., March 28, 1865.'GENERAL:--The 5th army corps will move by the Vaughn Road at three A.M.to-morrow morning.  The 2d moves at about nine A.M., having but aboutthree miles to march to reach the point designated for it to take on theright of the 5th corps, after the latter reaching Dinwiddie Court House.Move your cavalry at as early an hour as you can, and without beingconfined to any particular road or roads.  You may go out by the nearestroads in rear of the 5th corps, pass by its left, and passing near to orthrough Dinwiddie, reach the right and rear of the enemy as soon as youcan.  It is not the intention to attack the enemy in his intrenchedposition, but to force him out, if possible. Should he come out andattack us, or get himself where he can be attacked, move in with yourentire force in your own way, and with the full reliance that the armywill engage or follow, as circumstances will dictate.  I shall be on thefield, and will probably be able to communicate with you.  Should I notdo so, and you find that the enemy keeps within his main intrenchedline, you may cut loose and push for the Danville Road.  If you find itpracticable, I would like you to cross the South Side Road, betweenPetersburg and Burkesville, and destroy it to some extent.  I would notadvise much detention, however, until you reach the Danville Road, whichI would like you to strike as near to the Appomattox as possible.  Makeyour destruction on that road as complete as possible.  You can thenpass on to the South Side Road, west of Burkesville, and destroy that inlike manner.'After having accomplished the destruction of the two railroads, whichare now the only avenues of supply to Lee's army, you may return to thisarmy, selecting your road further south, or you may go on into NorthCarolina and join General Sherman.  Should you select the latter course,get the information to me as early as possible, so that I may sendorders to meet you at Goldsboro'.'U. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General.'MAJOR-GENERAL P. H. SHERIDAN.'On the morning of the 29th the movement commenced.  At night the cavalrywas at Dinwiddie Court House, and the left of our infantry line extendedto the Quaker Road, near its intersection with the Boydton Plank Road.The position of the troops from left to right was as follows:  Sheridan,Warren, Humphreys, Ord, Wright, Parke.Everything looked favorable to the defeat of the enemy and the captureof Petersburg and Richmond, if the proper effort was made.  I thereforeaddressed the following communication to General Sheridan, havingpreviously informed him verbally not to cut loose for the raidcontemplated in his orders until he received notice from me to do so:'GRAVELLY CREEK, March 29, 1865.'GENERAL:--Our line is now unbroken from the Appomattox to Dinwiddie.We are all ready, however, to give up all, from the Jerusalem Plank Roadto Hatcher's Run, whenever the forces can be used advantageously.  Aftergetting into line south of Hatcher's, we pushed forward to find theenemy's position. General Griffin was attacked near where the QuakerRoad intersects the Boydton Road, but repulsed it easily, capturingabout one hundred men.  Humphreys reached Dabney's Mill, and was pushingon when last heard from.'I now feel like ending the matter, if it is possible to do so, beforegoing back.  I do not want you, therefore, to cut loose and go after theenemy's roads at present.  In the morning push around the enemy, if youcan, and get on to his right rear.  The movements of the enemy's cavalrymay, of course, modify your action.  We will act all together as onearmy here, until it is seen what can be done with the enemy.  Thesignal-officer at Cobb's Hill reported, at half-past eleven A.M., that acavalry column had passed that point from Richmond towards Petersburg,taking forty minutes to pass.'U. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General.'MAJOR-GENERAL P. H. SHERIDAN.'From the night of the 29th to the morning of the 31st the rain fell insuch torrents as to make it impossible to move a wheeled vehicle, exceptas corduroy roads were laid in front of them. During the 30th, Sheridanadvanced from Dinwiddie Court House towards Five Forks, where he foundthe enemy in full force. General Warren advanced and extended his lineacross the Boydton Plank Road to near the White Oak Road, with a view ofgetting across the latter; but, finding the enemy strong in his frontand extending beyond his left, was directed to hold on where he was, andfortify.  General Humphreys drove the enemy from his front into his mainline on the Hatcher, near Burgess's Mills. Generals Ord, Wright, andParke made examinations in their fronts to determine the feasibility ofan assault on the enemy's lines.  The two latter reported favorably.The enemy confronting us as he did, at every point from Richmond to ourextreme left, I conceived his lines must be weakly held, and could bepenetrated if my estimate of his forces was correct.  I determined,therefore, to extend our line no farther, but to reinforce GeneralSheridan with a corps of infantry, and thus enable him to cut loose andturn the enemy's right flank, and with the other corps assault theenemy's lines.  The result of the offensive effort of the enemy the weekbefore, when he assaulted Fort Stedman, particularly favored this.  Theenemy's intrenched  picket-line captured by us at that time threw thelines occupied by the belligerents so close together at some points thatit was but a moment's run from one to the other. Preparations were atonce made to relieve General Humphreys's corps, to report to GeneralSheridan; but the condition of the roads prevented immediate movement.On the morning of the 31st, General Warren reported favorably to gettingpossession of the White Oak Road, and was directed to do so.  Toaccomplish this, he moved with one division, instead of his whole corps,which was attacked by the enemy in superior force and driven back on the2d division before it had time to form, and it, in turn, forced backupon the 3d division, when the enemy was checked.  A division of the 2dcorps was immediately sent to his support, the enemy driven back withheavy loss, and possession of the White Oak Road gained.  Sheridanadvanced, and with a portion of his cavalry got possession of the FiveForks; but the enemy, after the affair with the 5th corps, reinforcedthe rebel cavalry, defending that point with infantry, and forced himback towards Dinwiddie Court House.  Here General Sheridan displayedgreat generalship.  Instead of retreating with his whole command on themain army, to tell the story of superior forces encountered, he deployedhis cavalry on foot, leaving only mounted men enough to take charge ofthe horses.  This compelled the enemy to deploy over a vast extent ofwooded and broken country, and made his progress slow.  At this juncturehe dispatched to me what had taken place, and that he was dropping backslowly on Dinwiddie Court House.  General Mackenzie's cavalry and onedivision of the 5th corps were immediately ordered to his assistance.Soon after receiving a report from General Meade that Humphreys couldhold our position on the Boydton Road, and that the other two divisionsof the 5th corps could go to Sheridan, they were so ordered at once.Thus the operations of the day necessitated the sending of Warren,because of his accessibility, instead of Humphreys, as was intended, andprecipitated intended movements.  On the morning of the 1st of April,General Sheridan, reinforced by General Warren, drove the enemy back onFive Forks, where, late in the evening, he assaulted and carried hisstrongly fortified position, capturing all his artillery and betweenfive and six thousand prisoners.About the close of this battle, Brevet Major-General Charles Griffinrelieved Major-General Warren in command of the 5th corps.  The reportof this reached me after nightfall.  Some apprehensions filled my mindlest the enemy might desert his lines during the night, and by fallingupon General Sheridan before assistance could reach him, drive him fromhis position and open the way for retreat.  To guard against this,General Miles's division of Humphreys's corps was sent to reinforce him,and a bombardment was commenced and kept up until four o'clock in themorning (April 2), when an assault was ordered on the enemy's lines.General Wright penetrated the lines with his whole corps, sweepingeverything before him, and to his left towards Hatcher's Run, capturingmany guns and several thousand prisoners.  He was closely followed bytwo divisions of General Ord's command, until he met the other divisionof General Ord's that had succeeded in forcing the enemy's lines nearHatcher's Run. Generals Wright and Ord immediately swung to the right,and closed all of the enemy on that side of them in Petersburg, whileGeneral Humphreys pushed forward with two divisions and joined GeneralWright on the left.  General Parke succeeded in carrying the enemy'smain line, capturing guns and prisoners, but was unable to carry hisinner line.  General Sheridan being advised of the condition of affairs,returned General Miles to his proper command.  On reaching the enemy'slines immediately surrounding Petersburg, a portion of General Gibbon'scorps, by a most gallant charge, captured two strong inclosed works--themost salient and commanding south of Petersburg--thus materiallyshortening the line of investment necessary for taking in the city.  Theenemy south of Hatcher's Run retreated westward to Sutherland's Station,where they were overtaken by Miles's division.  A severe engagementensued, and lasted until both his right and left flanks were threatenedby the approach of General Sheridan, who was moving from Ford's Stationtowards Petersburg, and a division sent by General Meade from the frontof Petersburg, when he broke in the utmost confusion, leaving in ourhands his guns and many prisoners.  This force retreated by the mainroad along the Appomattox River.  During the night of the 2d the enemyevacuated Petersburg and Richmond, and retreated towards Danville.  Onthe morning of the 3d pursuit was commenced.  General Sheridan pushedfor the Danville Road, keeping near the Appomattox, followed by GeneralMeade with the 2d and 6th corps, while General Ord moved forBurkesville, along the South Side Road; the 9th corps stretched alongthat road behind him.  On the 4th, General Sheridan struck the DanvilleRoad near Jetersville, where he learned that Lee was at Amelia CourtHouse.  He immediately intrenched himself and awaited the arrival ofGeneral Meade, who reached there the next day. General Ord reachedBurkesville on the evening of the 5th.On the morning of the 5th, I addressed Major-General Sherman thefollowing communication:'WILSON'S STATION, April 5, 1865.'GENERAL:  All indications now are that Lee will attempt to reachDanville with the remnant of his force.  Sheridan, who was up with himlast night, reports all that is left, horse, foot, and dragoons, attwenty thousand, much demoralized.  We hope to reduce this numberone-half.  I shall push on to Burkesville, and if a stand is made atDanville, will in a very few days go there.  If you can possibly do so,push on from where you are, and let us see if we cannot finish the jobwith Lee's and Johnston's armies.  Whether it will be better for you tostrike for Greensboro', or nearer to Danville, you will be better ableto judge when you receive this.  Rebel armies now are the only strategicpoints to strike at.'U. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General.'MAJOR-GENERAL W. T. SHERMAN.'On the morning of the 6th, it was found that General Lee was moving westof Jetersville, towards Danville.  General Sheridan moved with hiscavalry (the 5th corps having been returned to General Meade on hisreaching Jetersville) to strike his flank, followed by the 6th corps,while the 2d and 5th corps pressed hard after, forcing him to abandonseveral hundred wagons and several pieces of artillery.  General Ordadvanced from Burkesville towards Farmville, sending two regiments ofinfantry and a squadron of cavalry, under Brevet Brigadier-GeneralTheodore Read, to reach and destroy the bridges.  This advance met thehead of Lee's column near Farmville, which it heroically attacked anddetained until General Read was killed and his small force overpowered.This caused a delay in the enemy's movements, and enabled General Ord toget well up with the remainder of his force, on meeting which, the enemyimmediately intrenched himself.  In the afternoon, General Sheridanstruck the enemy south of Sailors' Creek, captured sixteen pieces ofartillery and about four hundred wagons, and detained him until the 6thcorps got up, when a general attack of infantry and cavalry was made,which resulted in the capture of six or seven thousand prisoners, amongwhom were many general officers.  The movements of the 2d corps andGeneral Ord's command contributed greatly to the day's success.On the morning of the 7th the pursuit was renewed, the cavalry, exceptone division, and the 5th corps moving by Prince Edward's Court House;the 6th corps, General Ord's command, and one division of cavalry, onFarmville; and the 2d corps by the High Bridge Road.  It was soon foundthat the enemy had crossed to the north side of the Appomattox; but soclose was the pursuit, that the 2d corps got possession of the commonbridge at High Bridge before the enemy could destroy it, and immediatelycrossed over.  The 6th corps and a division of cavalry crossed atFarmville to its support.Feeling now that General Lee's chance of escape was utterly hopeless, Iaddressed him the following communication from Farmville:'April 7, 1865.'GENERAL--The result of the last week must convince you of thehopelessness of further resistance on the part of the Army of NorthernVirginia in this struggle.  I feel that it is so, and regard it as myduty to shift from myself the responsibility of any further effusion ofblood, by asking of you the surrender of that portion of the ConfederateStates army known as the Army of Northern Virginia.'U. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General.'GENERAL R. E. LEE.'Early on the morning of the 8th, before leaving, I received at Farmvillethe following:'April 7, 1865.'GENERAL:  I have received your note of this date.  Though notentertaining the opinion you express on the hopelessness of furtherresistance on the part of the Army of Northern Virginia, I reciprocateyour desire to avoid useless effusion of blood, and therefore, beforeconsidering your proposition, ask the terms you will offer on conditionof its surrender.'R. E. LEE, General.'LIEUTENANT-GENERAL U. S. GRANT.'To this I immediately replied:'April 8, 1865.'GENERAL:--Your note of last evening, in reply to mine of same date,asking the condition on which I will accept the surrender of the Army ofNorthern Virginia, is just received.  In reply, I would say, that peacebeing my great desire, there is but one condition I would insist upon--namely, That the men and officers surrendered shall be disqualified fortaking up arms again against the Government of the United States untilproperly exchanged.  I will meet you, or will designate officers to meetany officers you may name for the same purpose, at any point agreeableto you, for the purpose of arranging definitely the terms upon which thesurrender of the Army of the Northern Virginia will be received.'U. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General.'GENERAL R. E. LEE.'Early on the morning of the 8th the pursuit was resumed. General Meadefollowed north of the Appomattox, and General Sheridan, with all thecavalry, pushed straight ahead for Appomattox Station, followed byGeneral Ord's command and the 5th corps. During the day General Meade'sadvance had considerable fighting with the enemy's rear-guard, but wasunable to bring on a general engagement.  Late in the evening GeneralSheridan struck the railroad at Appomattox Station, drove the enemy fromthere, and captured twenty-five pieces of artillery, a hospital train,and four trains of cars loaded with supplies for Lee's army.  Duringthis day I accompanied General Meade's column, and about midnightreceived the following communication from General Lee:April 8, 1865.'GENERAL:--I received, at a late hour, your note of to-day.  In mine ofyesterday I did not intend to propose the surrender of the Army ofNorthern Virginia, but to ask the terms of your proposition.  To befrank, I do not think the emergency has arisen to call for the surrenderof this army; but as the restoration of peace should be the sole objectof all, I desired to know whether your proposals would lead to that end.I cannot, therefore, meet you with a view to the surrender of the Armyof Northern Virginia; but as far as your proposal may affect theConfederate States forces under my command, and tend to the restorationof peace, I should be pleased to meet you at ten A.M. to-morrow on theold stage-road to Richmond, between the picket-lines of the two armies.'R. E. LEE, General.'LIEUTENANT-GENERAL U. S. GRANT.'Early on the morning of the 9th I returned him an answer as follows, andimmediately started to join the column south of the Appomattox:'April 9, 1865.'GENERAL:--Your note of yesterday is received.  I have no authority totreat on the subject of peace; the meeting proposed for ten A.M. to-daycould lead to no good.  I will state, however, general, that I amequally anxious for peace with yourself, and the whole North entertainsthe same feeling.  The terms upon which peace can be had are wellunderstood.  By the South laying down their arms they will hasten thatmost desirable event, save thousands of human lives, and hundreds ofmillions of property not yet destroyed.  Seriously hoping that all ourdifficulties may be settled without the loss of another life, Isubscribe myself, etc.'U. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General.'GENERAL R. E. LEE.'On this morning of the 9th, General Ord's command and the 5th corpsreached Appomattox Station just as the enemy was making a desperateeffort to break through our cavalry.  The infantry was at once thrownin.  Soon after a white flag was received, requesting a suspension ofhostilities pending negotiations for a surrender.Before reaching General Sheridan's headquarters, I received thefollowing from General Lee:'April 9, 1865.'GENERAL:--I received your note of this morning on the picket-line,whither I had come to meet you, and ascertain definitely what terms wereembraced in your proposal of yesterday with reference to the surrenderof this army.  I now ask an interview, in accordance with the offercontained in your letter of yesterday, for that purpose.'R. E. LEE, General.'LIEUTENANT-GENERAL U. S. GRANT.'The interview was held at Appomattox Court-House, the result of which isset forth in the following correspondence:APPOMATTOX COURT-HOUSE, Virginia, April 9, 1865.'GENERAL:  In accordance with the substance of my letter to you of the8th instant, I propose to receive the surrender of the Army of NorthernVirginia on the following terms, to wit:  Rolls of all the officers andmen to be made in duplicate, one copy to be given to an officer to bedesignated by me, the other to be retained by such officer or officersas you may designate.  The officers to give their individual paroles notto take up arms against the Government of the United States untilproperly exchanged; and each company or regimental commander sign a likeparole for the men of their commands.  The arms, artillery, and publicproperty to be parked and stacked, and turned over to the officersappointed by me to receive them.  This will not embrace the side-arms ofthe officers, nor their private horses or baggage.  This done, eachofficer and man will be allowed to return to his home, not to bedisturbed by United States authority so long as they observe theirparoles and the laws in force where they may reside.'U. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General.'GENERAL R. E. LEE.''HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF NORTHERN VIRGINIA, April 9, 1865.'GENERAL:  I have received your letter of this date containing the termsof surrender of the Army of Northern Virginia as proposed by you.  Asthey are substantially the same as those expressed in your letter of the8th instant, they are accepted.  I will proceed to designate the properofficers to carry the stipulations into effect.'R. E. LEE, General.'LIEUTENANT-GENERAL U. S. GRANT.'The command of Major-General Gibbon, the 5th army corps under Griffin,and Mackenzie's cavalry, were designated to remain at AppomattoxCourt-House until the paroling of the surrendered army was completed,and to take charge of the public property. The remainder of the armyimmediately returned to the vicinity of Burkesville.General Lee's great influence throughout the whole South caused hisexample to be followed, and to-day the result is that the armies latelyunder his leadership are at their homes, desiring peace and quiet, andtheir arms are in the hands of our ordnance officers.On the receipt of my letter of the 5th, General Sherman moved directlyagainst Joe Johnston, who retreated rapidly on and through Raleigh,which place General Sherman occupied on the morning of the 13th.  Theday preceding, news of the surrender of General Lee reached him atSmithfield.On the 14th a correspondence was opened between General Sherman andGeneral Johnston, which resulted on the 18th in an agreement for asuspension of hostilities, and a memorandum or basis for peace, subjectto the approval of the President.  This agreement was disapproved by thePresident on the 21st, which disapproval, together with yourinstructions, was communicated to General Sherman by me in person on themorning of the 24th, at Raleigh, North Carolina, in obedience to yourorders.  Notice was at once given by him to General Johnston for thetermination of the truce that had been entered into.  On the 25thanother meeting between them was agreed upon, to take place on the 26th,which terminated in the surrender and disbandment of Johnston's armyupon substantially the same terms as were given to General Lee.The expedition under General Stoneman from East Tennessee got off on the20th of March, moving by way of Boone, North Carolina, and struck therailroad at Wytheville, Chambersburg, and Big Lick.  The force strikingit at Big Lick pushed on to within a few miles of Lynchburg, destroyingthe important bridges, while with the main force he effectuallydestroyed it between New River and Big Lick, and then turned forGreensboro', on the North Carolina Railroad; struck that road anddestroyed the bridges between Danville and Greensboro', and betweenGreensboro' and the Yadkin, together with the depots of supplies alongit, and captured four hundred prisoners.  At Salisbury he attacked anddefeated a force of the enemy under General Gardiner, capturing fourteenpieces of artillery and one thousand three hundred and sixty-fourprisoners, and destroyed large amounts of army stores.  At this place hedestroyed fifteen miles of railroad and the bridges towards Charlotte.Thence he moved to Slatersville.General Canby, who had been directed in January to make preparations fora movement from Mobile Bay against Mobile and the interior of Alabama,commenced his movement on the 20th of March.  The 16th corps,Major-General A. J. Smith commanding, moved from Fort Gaines by water toFish River; the 13th corps, under Major-General Gordon Granger, movedfrom Fort Morgan and joined the 16th corps on Fish River, both movingthence on Spanish Fort and investing it on the 27th; while Major-GeneralSteele's command moved from Pensacola, cut the railroad leading fromTensas to Montgomery, effected a junction with them, and partiallyinvested Fort Blakely.  After a severe bombardment of Spanish Fort, apart of its line was carried on the 8th of April.  During the night theenemy evacuated the fort.  Fort Blakely was carried by assault on the9th, and many prisoners captured; our loss was considerable.  Thesesuccesses practically opened to us the Alabama River, and enabled us toapproach Mobile from the north.  On the night of the 11th the city wasevacuated, and was taken possession of by our forces on the morning ofthe 12th.The expedition under command of Brevet Major-General Wilson, consistingof twelve thousand five hundred mounted men, was delayed by rains untilMarch 22d, when it moved from Chickasaw, Alabama.  On the 1st of April,General Wilson encountered the enemy in force under Forrest nearEbenezer Church, drove him in confusion, captured three hundredprisoners and three guns, and destroyed the central bridge over theCahawba River.  On the 2d he attacked and captured the fortified city ofSelma, defended by Forrest, with seven thousand men and thirty-two guns,destroyed the arsenal, armory, naval foundry, machine-shops, vastquantities of stores, and captured three thousand prisoners.  On the 4thhe captured and destroyed Tuscaloosa.  On the 10th he crossed theAlabama River, and after sending information of his operations toGeneral Canby, marched on Montgomery, which place he occupied on the14th, the enemy having abandoned it.  At this place many stores and fivesteamboats fell into our hands.  Thence a force marched direct onColumbus, and another on West Point, both of which places were assaultedand captured on the 16th.  At the former place we got one thousand fivehundred prisoners and fifty-two field-guns, destroyed two gunboats, thenavy yard, foundries, arsenal, many factories, and much other publicproperty.  At the latter place we got three hundred prisoners, fourguns, and destroyed nineteen locomotives and three hundred cars.  On the20th he took possession of Macon, Georgia, with sixty field-guns, onethousand two hundred militia, and five generals, surrendered by GeneralHowell Cobb.  General Wilson, hearing that Jeff. Davis was trying tomake his escape, sent forces in pursuit and succeeded in capturing himon the morning of May 11th.On the 4th day of May, General Dick Taylor surrendered to General Canbyall the remaining rebel forces east of the Mississippi.A force sufficient to insure an easy triumph over the enemy under KirbySmith, west of the Mississippi, was immediately put in motion for Texas,and Major-General Sheridan designated for its immediate command; but onthe 26th day of May, and before they reached their destination, GeneralKirby Smith surrendered his entire command to Major-General Canby.  Thissurrender did not take place, however, until after the capture of therebel President and Vice-President; and the bad faith was exhibited offirst disbanding most of his army and permitting an indiscriminateplunder of public property.Owing to the report that many of those lately in arms against thegovernment had taken refuge upon the soil of Mexico, carrying with themarms rightfully belonging to the United States, which had beensurrendered to us by agreement among them some of the leaders who hadsurrendered in person and the disturbed condition of affairs on the RioGrande, the orders for troops to proceed to Texas were not changed.There have been severe combats, raids, expeditions, and movements todefeat the designs and purposes of the enemy, most of them reflectinggreat credit on our arms, and which contributed greatly to our finaltriumph, that I have not mentioned.  Many of these will be found clearlyset forth in the reports herewith submitted; some in the telegrams andbrief dispatches announcing them, and others, I regret to say, have notas yet been officially reported.For information touching our Indian difficulties, I would respectfullyrefer to the reports of the commanders of departments in which they haveoccurred.It has been my fortune to see the armies of both the West and the Eastfight battles, and from what I have seen I know there is no differencein their fighting qualities.  All that it was possible for men to do inbattle they have done.  The Western armies commenced their battles inthe Mississippi Valley, and received the final surrender of the remnantof the principal army opposed to them in North Carolina.  The armies ofthe East commenced their battles on the river from which the Army of thePotomac derived its name, and received the final surrender of their oldantagonists at Appomattox Court House, Virginia.  The splendidachievements of each have nationalized our victories removed allsectional jealousies (of which we have unfortunately experienced toomuch), and the cause of crimination and recrimination that might havefollowed had either section failed in its duty.  All have a proudrecord, and all sections can well congratulate themselves and each otherfor having done their full share in restoring the supremacy of law overevery foot of territory belonging to the United States.  Let them hopefor perpetual peace and harmony with that enemy, whose manhood, howevermistaken the cause, drew forth such herculean deeds of valor.I have the honor to be, Very respectfully, your obedient servant, U. S.GRANT, Lieutenant-General.THE END
ENTP	BENJAMIN FRANKLIN was born in Milk Street, Boston, on January6, 1706.  His father, Josiah , was a tallow chandler whomarried twice, and of his seventeen children Benjamin was the youngestson.  His schooling ended at ten, and at twelve he was bound apprenticeto his brother James, a printer, who published the 'New EnglandCourant.' To this journal he became a contributor, and later was fora time its nominal editor. But the brothers quarreled, and Benjaminran away, going first to New York, and thence to Philadelphia, wherehe arrived in October, 1723.  He soon obtained work as a printer,but after a few months he was induced by Governor Keith to go toLondon, where, finding Keith's promises empty, he again worked as acompositor till he was brought back to Philadelphia by a merchantnamed  Denman, who gave him a position in his business. On Denman'sdeath he returned to his former trade, and shortly set up a printinghouse of his own from which he published 'The Pennsylvania Gazette,'to which he contributed many essays, and which he made a medium foragitating a variety of local reforms. In 1732 he began to issue hisfamous 'Poor Richard's Almanac' for the enrichment of which he borrowedor composed those pithy utterances of worldly wisdom which are thebasis of a large part of his popular reputation.  In 1758, the yearin which he ceases writing for the Almanac, he printed in it 'FatherAbraham's Sermon,' now regarded as the most famous piece of literatureproduced in Colonial America.Meantime was concerning himself more and more withpublic affairs.  He set forth a scheme for an Academy, which wastaken up later and finally developed into the University of Pennsylvania;and he founded an 'American Philosophical Society' for the purposeof enabling scientific  men to communicate their discoveries to oneanother.  He himself had already begun his electrical researches,which, with other scientific inquiries, he called on in the intervalsof money-making and politics to the end of his life.  In 1748 hesold his business in order to get leisure for study, having nowacquired comparative wealth; and in a few years he had made discoveriesthat gave him a reputation with the learned throughout Europe.  Inpolitics he proved very able both as an administrator and as acontroversialist; but his record as an office-holder is stained bythe use he made of his position to advance his relatives.  His mostnotable service in home politics was his reform of the postal system;but his fame as a statesman rests chiefly on his services in connectionwith the relations of the Colonies with Great Britain, and later withFrance.  In 1757 he was sent to England to protest against theinfluence of the Penns in the government of the colony, and for fiveyears he remained there, striving to enlighten the people and theministry of England as to Colonial conditions.  On his return toAmerica he played an honorable part in the Paxton affair, throughwhich he lost his seat in the Assembly; but in 1764 he was againdespatched to England as agent for the colony, this time to petitionthe King to resume the government from the hands of the proprietors.In London he actively opposed the proposed Stamp Act, but lost thecredit for this and much of his popularity through his securing fora friend the office of stamp agent in America.  Even his effectivework in helping to obtain the repeal of the act left him still asuspect; but he continued his efforts to present the case for theColonies as the troubles thickened toward the crisis of the Revolution.In 1767 he crossed to France, where he was received with honor; butbefore his return home in 1775 he lost his position as postmasterthrough his share in divulging to Massachusetts the famous letter ofHutchinson and Oliver.  On his arrival in Philadelphia he was chosena member of the Continental Congress and in 1777 he was despatchedto France as commissioner for the United States.  Here he remainedtill 1785, the favorite of French society; and with such success didhe conduct the affairs of his country that when he finally returnedhe received a place only second to that of Washington as the championof American independence.  He died on April 17, 1790.The first five chapters of the Autobiography were composed inEngland in 1771, continued in 1784-5, and again in 1788, at whichdate he brought it down to 1757.  After a most extraordinary seriesof adventures, the original form of the manuscript was finally printedby Mr. John Bigelow, and is here reproduced in recognition of itsvalue as a picture of one of the most notable personalities of Colonialtimes, and of its acknowledged rank as one of the great autobiographiesof the world.BENJAMIN FRANKLINHIS AUTOBIOGRAPHY1706-1757TWYFORD, at the Bishop of St. Asaph's,<0>  1771.     <0> The country-seat of Bishop Shipley, the good bishop,         as Dr.

Having emerged from the poverty and obscurityin which I was born and bred, to a state of affluence and somedegree of reputation in the world, and having gone so far throughlife with a considerable share of felicity, the conducing meansI made use of, which with the blessing of God so well succeeded,my posterity may like to know, as they may find some of themsuitable to their own situations, and therefore fit to be imitated.     <1> After the words 'agreeable to' the words 'some of' were         interlined and afterward effaced.--B.That felicity, when I reflected on it, has induced me sometimesto say, that were it offered to my choice, I should have no objectionto a repetition of the same life from its beginning, only askingthe advantages authors have in a second edition to correct some faultsof the first.  So I might, besides correcting the faults, change somesinister accidents and events of it for others more favorable.But though this were denied, I should still accept the offer.Since such a repetition is not to be expected, the next thingmost like living one's life over again seems to be a recollectionof that life, and to make that recollection as durable as possibleby putting it down in writing.Hereby, too, I shall indulge the inclination so natural in old men,to be talking of themselves and their own past actions; and I shallindulge it without being tiresome to others, who, through respectto age, might conceive themselves obliged to give me a hearing,since this may be read or not as any one pleases.  And, lastly (I mayas well confess it, since my denial of it will be believed by nobody),perhaps I shall a good deal gratify my own vanity.  Indeed, I scarceever heard or saw the introductory words, 'Without vanity I may say,'&c., but some vain thing immediately followed.  Most people dislikevanity in others, whatever share they have of it themselves;but I give it fair quarter wherever I meet with it, being persuadedthat it is often productive of good to the possessor, and to othersthat are within his sphere of action; and therefore, in many cases,it would not be altogether absurd if a man were to thank God for hisvanity among the other comforts of life.And now I speak of thanking God, I desire with all humilityto acknowledge that I owe the mentioned happiness of my pastlife to His kind providence, which lead me to the means I usedand gave them success.  My belief of this induces me to hope,though I must not presume, that the same goodness will still beexercised toward me, in continuing that happiness, or enablingme to bear a fatal reverse, which I may experience as othershave done:  the complexion of my future fortune being knownto Him only in whose power it is to bless to us even our afflictions.The notes one of my uncles (who had the same kind of curiosityin collecting family anecdotes) once put into my hands,furnished me with several particulars relating to our ancestors.From these notes I learned that the family had lived in thesame village, Ecton, in Northamptonshire, for three hundred years,and how much longer he knew not (perhaps from the time when the nameof 
ENTP	, that before was the name of an order of people,was assumed by them as a surname when others took surnamesall over the kingdom), on a freehold of about thirty acres,aided by the smith's business, which had continued in the familytill his time, the eldest son being always bred to that business;a custom which he and my father followed as to their eldest sons.When I searched the registers at Ecton, I found an accountof their births, marriages and burials from the year 1555 only,there being no registers kept in that parish at any time preceding.By that register I perceived that I was the youngest son of theyoungest son for five generations back.  My grandfather Thomas,who was born in 1598, lived at Ecton till he grew too old tofollow business longer, when he went to live with his son John,a dyer at Banbury, in Oxfordshire, with whom my father servedan apprenticeship.  There my grandfather died and lies buried.We saw his gravestone in 1758.  His eldest son Thomas lived inthe house at Ecton, and left it with the land to his only child,a daughter, who, with her husband, one Fisher, of Wellingborough,sold it to Mr. Isted, now lord of the manor there.  My grandfatherhad four sons that grew up, viz.: Thomas, John, Benjamin and Josiah.I will give you what account I can of them, at this distance frommy papers, and if these are not lost in my absence, you will amongthem find many more particulars.Thomas was bred a smith under his father; but, being ingenious,and encouraged in learning (as all my brothers were) by an EsquirePalmer, then the principal gentleman in that parish, he qualifiedhimself for the business of scrivener; became a considerable manin the county; was a chief mover of all public-spirited undertakingsfor the county or town of Northampton, and his own village,of which many instances were related of him; and much taken noticeof and patronized by the then Lord Halifax.  He died in 1702,January 6, old style, just four years to a day before I was born.The account we received of his life and character from some oldpeople at Ecton, I remember, struck you as something extraordinary,from its similarity to what you knew of mine.'Had he died on the same day,' you said, 'one might have supposeda transmigration.'John was bred a dyer, I believe of woolens.  Benjamin was bred a silkdyer, serving an apprenticeship at London.  He was an ingenious man.I remember him well, for when I was a boy he came over to my fatherin Boston, and lived in the house with us some years.  He livedto a great age.  His grandson, Samuel 
ENTP	, now lives in Boston.He left behind him two quarto volumes, MS., of his own poetry, consistingof little occasional pieces addressed to his friends and relations,of which the following, sent to me, is a specimen.<2> He had formeda short-hand of his own, which he taught me, but, never practising it,I have now forgot it.  I was named after this uncle, there beinga particular affection between him and my father.  He was very pious,a great attender of sermons of the best preachers, which he tookdown in his short-hand, and had with him many volumes of them.He was also much of a politician; too much, perhaps, for his station.There fell lately into my hands, in London, a collection he hadmade of all the principal pamphlets, relating to public affairs,from 1641 to 1717; many of the volumes are wanting as appearsby the numbering, but there still remain eight volumes in folio,and twenty-four in quarto and in octavo.  A dealer in old booksmet with them, and knowing me by my sometimes buying of him,he brought them to me.  It seems my uncle must have left them here,when he went to America, which was about fifty years since.There are many of his notes in the margins.     <2> Here follow in the margin the words, in brackets, 'here         insert it,' but the poetry is not given.  Mr. Sparks         informs us (Life of , p. 6) that these volumes         had been preserved, and were in possession of Mrs. Emmons,         of Boston, great-granddaughter of their author.This obscure family of ours was early in the Reformation,and continued Protestants through the reign of Queen Mary,when they were sometimes in danger of trouble on account of theirzeal against popery.  They had got an English Bible, and to concealand secure it, it was fastened open with tapes under and withinthe cover of a joint-stool. When my great-great-grandfather readit to his family, he turned up the joint-stool upon his knees,turning over the leaves then under the tapes.  One of the childrenstood at the door to give notice if he saw the apparitor coming,who was an officer of the spiritual court.  In that case the stoolwas turned down again upon its feet, when the Bible remained concealedunder it as before.  This anecdote I had from my uncle Benjamin.The family continued all of the Church of England till about the endof Charles the Second's reign, when some of the ministers that had beenouted for nonconformity holding conventicles in Northamptonshire,Benjamin and Josiah adhered to them, and so continued all their lives:the rest of the family remained with the Episcopal Church.Josiah, my father, married young, and carried his wife with threechildren into New England, about 1682.  The conventicles havingbeen forbidden by law, and frequently disturbed, induced someconsiderable men of his acquaintance to remove to that country,and he was prevailed with to accompany them thither, where they expectedto enjoy their mode of religion with freedom.  By the same wife hehad four children more born there, and by a second wife ten more,in all seventeen; of which I remember thirteen sitting at one timeat his table, who all grew up to be men and women, and married;I was the youngest son, and the youngest child but two, and was bornin Boston, New England.  My mother, the second wife, was Abiah Folger,daughter of Peter Folger, one of the first settlers of New England,of whom honorable mention is made by Cotton Mather in his churchhistory of that country, entitled Magnalia Christi Americana,as 'a godly, learned Englishman,' if I remember the words rightly.I have heard that he wrote sundry small occasional pieces,but only one of them was printed, which I saw now many years since.It was written in 1675, in the home-spun verse of that time and people,and addressed to those then concerned in the government there.It was in favor of liberty of conscience, and in behalf of the Baptists,Quakers, and other sectaries that had been under persecution,ascribing the Indian wars, and other distresses that had befallenthe country, to that persecution, as so many judgments of Godto punish so heinous an offense, and exhorting a repeal of thoseuncharitable laws.  The whole appeared to me as written with a gooddeal of decent plainness and manly freedom.  The six concluding linesI remember, though I have forgotten the two first of the stanza;but the purport of them was, that his censures proceeded fromgood-will, and, therefore, he would be known to be the author.          'Because to be a libeller (says he)          I hate it with my heart;          From Sherburne town, where now I dwell          My name I do put here;          Without offense your real friend,          It is Peter Folgier.'My elder brothers were all put apprentices to different trades.I was put to the grammar-school at eight years of age, my fatherintending to devote me, as the tithe of his sons, to the serviceof the Church.  My early readiness in learning to read (which musthave been very early, as I do not remember when I could not read),and the opinion of all his friends, that I should certainly make agood scholar, encouraged him in this purpose of his.  My uncle Benjamin,too, approved of it, and proposed to give me all his short-handvolumes of sermons, I suppose as a stock to set up with, if I wouldlearn his character.  I continued, however, at the grammar-schoolnot quite one year, though in that time I had risen graduallyfrom the middle of the class of that year to be the head of it,and farther was removed into the next class above it, in order to gowith that into the third at the end of the year.  But my father,in the meantime, from a view of the expense of a college education,which having so large a family he could not well afford, and the meanliving many so educated were afterwards able to obtain--reasons thathe gave to his friends in my hearing--altered his first intention,took me from the grammar-school, and sent me to a school for writingand arithmetic, kept by a then famous man, Mr. George Brownell,very successful in his profession generally, and that by mild,encouraging methods.  Under him I acquired fair writing pretty soon,but I failed in the arithmetic, and made no progress in it.At ten years old I was taken home to assist my father in his business,which was that of a tallow-chandler and sope-boiler; a business hewas not bred to, but had assumed on his arrival in New England,and on finding his dying trade would not maintain his family,being in little request.  Accordingly, I was employed in cutting wickfor the candles, filling the dipping mold and the molds for cast candles,attending the shop, going of errands, etc.I disliked the trade, and had a strong inclination for the sea,but my father declared against it; however, living near the water,I was much in and about it, learnt early to swim well, and tomanage boats; and when in a boat or canoe with other boys, I wascommonly allowed to govern, especially in any case of difficulty;and upon other occasions I was generally a leader among the boys,and sometimes led them into scrapes, of which I will mentionone instance, as it shows an early projecting public spirit, tho'not then justly conducted.There was a salt-marsh that bounded part of the mill-pond,on the edge of which, at high water, we used to stand to fishfor minnows.  By much trampling, we had made it a mere quagmire.My proposal was to build a wharff there fit for us to stand upon,and I showed my comrades a large heap of stones, which were intendedfor a new house near the marsh, and which would very well suitour purpose.  Accordingly, in the evening, when the workmenwere gone, I assembled a number of my play-fellows, and workingwith them diligently like so many emmets, sometimes two or threeto a stone, we brought them all away and built our little wharff.The next morning the workmen were surprised at missing the stones,which were found in our wharff.  Inquiry was made after the removers;we were discovered and complained of; several of us were correctedby our fathers; and though I pleaded the usefulness of the work,mine convinced me that nothing was useful which was not honest.I think you may like to know something of his person and character.He had an excellent constitution of body, was of middle stature,but well set, and very strong; he was ingenious, could draw prettily,was skilled a little in music, and had a clear pleasing voice,so that when he played psalm tunes on his violin and sung withal,as he sometimes did in an evening after the business of the day was over,it was extremely agreeable to hear.  He had a mechanical genius too,and, on occasion, was very handy in the use of other tradesmen's tools;but his great excellence lay in a sound understanding and solidjudgment in prudential matters, both in private and publick affairs.In the latter, indeed, he was never employed, the numerousfamily he had to educate and the straitness of his circumstanceskeeping him close to his trade; but I remember well his beingfrequently visited by leading people, who consulted him for hisopinion in affairs of the town or of the church he belonged to,and showed a good deal of respect for his judgment and advice:he was also much consulted by private persons about their affairswhen any difficulty occurred, and frequently chosen an arbitratorbetween contending parties.At his table he liked to have, as often as he could, some sensiblefriend or neighbor to converse with, and always took care to startsome ingenious or useful topic for discourse, which might tendto improve the minds of his children.  By this means he turnedour attention to what was good, just, and prudent in the conductof life; and little or no notice was ever taken of what relatedto the victuals on the table, whether it was well or ill dressed,in or out of season, of good or bad flavor, preferable or inferiorto this or that other thing of the kind, so that I was bro't upin such a perfect inattention to those matters as to be quiteindifferent what kind of food was set before me, and so unobservantof it, that to this day if I am asked I can scarce tell a few hoursafter dinner what I dined upon.  This has been a convenience to mein travelling, where my companions have been sometimes very unhappyfor want of a suitable gratification of their more delicate,because better instructed, tastes and appetites.My mother had likewise an excellent constitution:  she suckledall her ten children.  I never knew either my father or motherto have any sickness but that of which they dy'd, he at 89,and she at 85 years of age.  They lie buried together at Boston,where I some years since placed a marble over their grave,with this inscription:                        JOSIAH FRANKLIN,                               and                         ABIAH his Wife,                       lie here interred.             They lived lovingly together in wedlock                        fifty-five years.          Without an estate, or any gainful employment,                 By constant labor and industry,                      with God's blessing,                 They maintained a large family                          comfortably,                and brought up thirteen children                     and seven grandchildren                           reputably.                   From this instance, reader,           Be encouraged to diligence in thy calling,                  And distrust not Providence.                 He was a pious and prudent man;               She, a discreet and virtuous woman.                       Their youngest son,                In filial regard to their memory,                       Places this stone.              J.F. born 1655, died 1744, AEtat 89.              A.F. born 1667, died 1752, ----- 95.By my rambling digressions I perceive myself to be grown old.I us'd to write more methodically.  But one does not dress for privatecompany as for a publick ball.  'Tis perhaps only negligence.To return:  I continued thus employed in my father's business fortwo years, that is, till I was twelve years old; and my brother John,who was bred to that business, having left my father, married, and setup for himself at Rhode Island, there was all appearance that Iwas destined to supply his place, and become a tallow-chandler.But my dislike to the trade continuing, my father was underapprehensions that if he did not find one for me more agreeable,I should break away and get to sea, as his son Josiah had done,to his great vexation.  He therefore sometimes took me to walk with him,and see joiners, bricklayers, turners, braziers, etc., at their work,that he might observe my inclination, and endeavor to fix it on sometrade or other on land.  It has ever since been a pleasure to meto see good workmen handle their tools; and it has been useful to me,having learnt so much by it as to be able to do little jobs myselfin my house when a workman could not readily be got, and to constructlittle machines for my experiments, while the intention of makingthe experiment was fresh and warm in my mind.  My father at lastfixed upon the cutler's trade, and my uncle Benjamin's son Samuel,who was bred to that business in London, being about that timeestablished in Boston, I was sent to be with him some time on liking.But his expectations of a fee with me displeasing my father,I was taken home again.From a child I was fond of reading, and all the little moneythat came into my hands was ever laid out in books.  Pleased withthe Pilgrim's Progress, my first collection was of John Bunyan'sworks in separate little volumes.  I afterward sold them to enableme to buy R. Burton's Historical Collections; they were smallchapmen's books, and cheap, 40 or 50 in all.  My father's littlelibrary consisted chiefly of books in polemic divinity, most ofwhich I read, and have since often regretted that, at a time when Ihad such a thirst for knowledge, more proper books had not fallenin my way since it was now resolved I should not be a clergyman.Plutarch's Lives there was in which I read abundantly, and I stillthink that time spent to great advantage.  There was also a book of DeFoe's, called an Essay on Projects, and another of Dr. Mather's,called Essays to do Good, which perhaps gave me a turn of thinkingthat had an influence on some of the principal future events of my life.This bookish inclination at length determined my father to make mea printer, though he had already one son (James) of that profession.In 1717 my brother James returned from England with a press andletters to set up his business in Boston.  I liked it much betterthan that of my father, but still had a hankering for the sea.To prevent the apprehended effect of such an inclination, my fatherwas impatient to have me bound to my brother.  I stood out some time,but at last was persuaded, and signed the indentures when I was yetbut twelve years old.  I was to serve as an apprentice till I wastwenty-one years of age, only I was to be allowed journeyman's wagesduring the last year.  In a little time I made great proficiencyin the business, and became a useful hand to my brother.  I nowhad access to better books.  An acquaintance with the apprenticesof booksellers enabled me sometimes to borrow a small one, which Iwas careful to return soon and clean.  Often I sat up in my roomreading the greatest part of the night, when the book was borrowedin the evening and to be returned early in the morning, lest itshould be missed or wanted.And after some time an ingenious tradesman, Mr. Matthew Adams, who hada pretty collection of books, and who frequented our printing-house,took notice of me, invited me to his library, and very kindly lentme such books as I chose to read.  I now took a fancy to poetry,and made some little pieces; my brother, thinking it might turnto account, encouraged me, and put me on composing occasional ballads.One was called The Lighthouse Tragedy, and contained an accountof the drowning of Captain Worthilake, with his two daughters:the other was a sailor's song, on the taking of Teach (or Blackbeard)the pirate.  They were wretched stuff, in the Grub-street-ballad style;and when they were printed he sent me about the town to sell them.The first sold wonderfully, the event being recent, having madea great noise.  This flattered my vanity; but my father discouragedme by ridiculing my performances, and telling me verse-makerswere generally beggars.  So I escaped being a poet, most probablya very bad one; but as prose writing bad been of great use to mein the course of my life, and was a principal means of my advancement,I shall tell you how, in such a situation, I acquired what littleability I have in that way.There was another bookish lad in the town, John Collins by name,with whom I was intimately acquainted.  We sometimes disputed,and very fond we were of argument, and very desirous of confutingone another, which disputatious turn, by the way, is apt to becomea very bad habit, making people often extremely disagreeable in companyby the contradiction that is necessary to bring it into practice;and thence, besides souring and spoiling the conversation,is productive of disgusts and, perhaps enmities where you may haveoccasion for friendship.  I had caught it by reading my father'sbooks of dispute about religion.  Persons of good sense, I havesince observed, seldom fall into it, except lawyers, university men,and men of all sorts that have been bred at Edinborough.A question was once, somehow or other, started between Collinsand me, of the propriety of educating the female sex in learning,and their abilities for study.  He was of opinion that it was improper,and that they were naturally unequal to it.  I took the contrary side,perhaps a little for dispute's sake.  He was naturally more eloquent,had a ready plenty of words; and sometimes, as I thought, bore medown more by his fluency than by the strength of his reasons.As we parted without settling the point, and were not to see oneanother again for some time, I sat down to put my arguments in writing,which I copied fair and sent to him.  He answered, and I replied.Three or four letters of a side had passed, when my father happenedto find my papers and read them.  Without entering into the discussion,he took occasion to talk to me about the manner of my writing;observed that, though I had the advantage of my antagonist in correctspelling and pointing (which I ow'd to the printing-house), I fellfar short in elegance of expression, in method and in perspicuity,of which he convinced me by several instances.  I saw the justiceof his remark, and thence grew more attentive to the manner in writing,and determined to endeavor at improvement.About this time I met with an odd volume of the Spectator.It was the third.  I had never before seen any of them.  I bought it,read it over and over, and was much delighted with it.  I thoughtthe writing excellent, and wished, if possible, to imitate it.With this view I took some of the papers, and, making short hintsof the sentiment in each sentence, laid them by a few days, and then,without looking at the book, try'd to compleat the papers again,by expressing each hinted sentiment at length, and as fully as ithad been expressed before, in any suitable words that shouldcome to hand.  Then I compared my Spectator with the original,discovered some of my faults, and corrected them.  But I found I wanteda stock of words, or a readiness in recollecting and using them,which I thought I should have acquired before that time if Ihad gone on making verses; since the continual occasion for wordsof the same import, but of different length, to suit the measure,or of different sound for the rhyme, would have laid me under a constantnecessity of searching for variety, and also have tended to fixthat variety in my mind, and make me master of it.  Therefore I tooksome of the tales and turned them into verse; and, after a time,when I had pretty well forgotten the prose, turned them back again.I also sometimes jumbled my collections of hints into confusion,and after some weeks endeavored to reduce them into the best order,before I began to form the full sentences and compleat the paper.This was to teach me method in the arrangement of thoughts.By comparing my work afterwards with the original, I discoveredmany faults and amended them; but I sometimes had the pleasureof fancying that, in certain particulars of small import,I had been lucky enough to improve the method or the language,and this encouraged me to think I might possibly in time come to bea tolerable English writer, of which I was extremely ambitious.My time for these exercises and for reading was at night,after work or before it began in the morning, or on Sundays,when I contrived to be in the printing-house alone, evading as muchas I could the common attendance on public worship which my fatherused to exact on me when I was under his care, and which indeedI still thought a duty, though I could not, as it seemed to me,afford time to practise it.When about 16 years of age I happened to meet with a book,written by one Tryon, recommending a vegetable diet.  I determinedto go into it.  My brother, being yet unmarried, did not keep house,but boarded himself and his apprentices in another family.  My refusingto eat flesh occasioned an inconveniency, and I was frequently chidfor my singularity.  I made myself acquainted with Tryon's mannerof preparing some of his dishes, such as boiling potatoes or rice,making hasty pudding, and a few others, and then proposed to my brother,that if he would give me, weekly, half the money he paid for my board,I would board myself.  He instantly agreed to it, and I presentlyfound that I could save half what he paid me.  This was an additionalfund for buying books.  But I had another advantage in it.My brother and the rest going from the printing-house to their meals,I remained there alone, and, despatching presently my light repast,which often was no more than a bisket or a slice of bread, a handfulof raisins or a tart from the pastry-cook's, and a glass of water,had the rest of the time till their return for study, in which Imade the greater progress, from that greater clearness of headand quicker apprehension which usually attend temperance in eatingand drinking.And now it was that, being on some occasion made asham'd of myignorance in figures, which I had twice failed in learning whenat school, I took Cocker's book of Arithmetick, and went throughthe whole by myself with great ease.  I also read Seller's andShermy's books of Navigation, and became acquainted with the littlegeometry they contain; but never proceeded far in that science.And I read about this time Locke On Human Understanding,and the Art of Thinking, by Messrs.  du Port Royal.While I was intent on improving my language, I met with an Englishgrammar (I think it was Greenwood's), at the end of which there weretwo little sketches of the arts of rhetoric and logic, the latterfinishing with a specimen of a dispute in the Socratic method;and soon after I procur'd Xenophon's Memorable Things of Socrates,wherein there are many instances of the same method.  I wascharm'd with it, adopted it, dropt my abrupt contradiction andpositive argumentation, and put on the humble inquirer and doubter.And being then, from reading Shaftesbury and Collins, become a realdoubter in many points of our religious doctrine, I found this methodsafest for myself and very embarrassing to those against whom I used it;therefore I took a delight in it, practis'd it continually, and grewvery artful and expert in drawing people, even of superior knowledge,into concessions, the consequences of which they did not foresee,entangling them in difficulties out of which they could notextricate themselves, and so obtaining victories that neither myselfnor my cause always deserved.  I continu'd this method some few years,but gradually left it, retaining only the habit of expressing myselfin terms of modest diffidence; never using, when I advanced any thingthat may possibly be disputed, the words certainly, undoubtedly, or anyothers that give the air of positiveness to an opinion; but rather say,I conceive or apprehend a thing to be so and so; it appears to me,or I should think it so or so, for such and such reasons;or I imagine it to be so; or it is so, if I am not mistaken.This habit, I believe, has been of great advantage to me when Ihave had occasion to inculcate my opinions, and persuade men intomeasures that I have been from time to time engag'd in promoting;and, as the chief ends of conversation are to inform or to be informed,to please or to persuade, I wish well-meaning, sensible men wouldnot lessen their power of doing good by a positive, assuming manner,that seldom fails to disgust, tends to create opposition, and todefeat every one of those purposes for which speech was given to us,to wit, giving or receiving information or pleasure.  For, if youwould inform, a positive and dogmatical manner in advancing yoursentiments may provoke contradiction and prevent a candid attention.If you wish information and improvement from the knowledge of others,and yet at the same time express yourself as firmly fix'd in yourpresent opinions, modest, sensible men, who do not love disputation,will probably leave you undisturbed in the possession of your error.And by such a manner, you can seldom hope to recommend yourselfin pleasing your hearers, or to persuade those whose concurrenceyou desire.  Pope says, judiciously:          'Men should be taught as if you taught them not,          And things unknown propos'd as things forgot;'farther recommending to us          'To speak, tho' sure, with seeming diffidence.'And he might have coupled with this line that which he has coupledwith another, I think, less properly,          'For want of modesty is want of sense.'If you ask, Why less properly? I must repeat the lines,          'Immodest words admit of no defense,          For want of modesty is want of sense.'Now, is not want of sense (where a man is so unfortunate as to want it)some apology for his want of modesty? and would not the lines standmore justly thus?          'Immodest words admit but this defense,          That want of modesty is want of sense.'This, however, I should submit to better judgments.My brother had, in 1720 or 1721, begun to print a newspaper.It was the second that appeared in America, and was called the NewEngland Courant.  The only one before it was the Boston News-Letter. Iremember his being dissuaded by some of his friends from the undertaking,as not likely to succeed, one newspaper being, in their judgment,enough for America.  At this time (1771) there are not lessthan five-and-twenty. He went on, however, with the undertaking,and after having worked in composing the types and printing offthe sheets, I was employed to carry the papers thro' the streetsto the customers.He had some ingenious men among his friends, who amus'd themselvesby writing little pieces for this paper, which gain'd it creditand made it more in demand, and these gentlemen often visited us.Hearing their conversations, and their accounts of the approbation theirpapers were received with, I was excited to try my hand among them;but, being still a boy, and suspecting that my brother would objectto printing anything of mine in his paper if he knew it to be mine,I contrived to disguise my hand, and, writing an anonymous paper,I put it in at night under the door of the printing-house. It was foundin the morning, and communicated to his writing friends when theycall'd in as usual.  They read it, commented on it in my hearing, and Ihad the exquisite pleasure of finding it met with their approbation,and that, in their different guesses at the author, none were namedbut men of some character among us for learning and ingenuity.I suppose now that I was rather lucky in my judges, and that perhapsthey were not really so very good ones as I then esteem'd them.Encourag'd, however, by this, I wrote and convey'd in the same wayto the press several more papers which were equally approv'd; and Ikept my secret till my small fund of sense for such performances waspretty well exhausted and then I discovered it, when I began to beconsidered a little more by my brother's acquaintance, and in a mannerthat did not quite please him, as he thought, probably with reason,that it tended to make me too vain.  And, perhaps, this might be oneoccasion of the differences that we began to have about this time.Though a brother, he considered himself as my master, and meas his apprentice, and accordingly, expected the same servicesfrom me as he would from another, while I thought he demean'd metoo much in some he requir'd of me, who from a brother expectedmore indulgence.  Our disputes were often brought before our father,and I fancy I was either generally in the right, or else abetter pleader, because the judgment was generally in my favor.But my brother was passionate, and had often beaten me, which Itook extreamly amiss; and, thinking my apprenticeship very tedious,I was continually wishing for some opportunity of shortening it,which at length offered in a manner unexpected.<3>      <3> I fancy his harsh and tyrannical treatment of me          might be a means of impressing me with that aversion          to arbitrary power that has stuck to me through my          whole life.One of the pieces in our newspaper on some political point, which Ihave now forgotten, gave offense to the Assembly.  He was taken up,censur'd, and imprison'd for a month, by the speaker's warrant,I suppose, because he would not discover his author.  I too was takenup and examin'd before the council; but, tho' I did not give themany satisfaction, they content'd themselves with admonishing me,and dismissed me, considering me, perhaps, as an apprentice, who wasbound to keep his master's secrets.During my brother's confinement, which I resented a good deal,notwithstanding our private differences, I had the managementof the paper; and I made bold to give our rulers some rubs in it,which my brother took very kindly, while others began to considerme in an unfavorable light, as a young genius that had a turnfor libelling and satyr.  My brother's discharge was accompany'dwith an order of the House (a very odd one), that 'James 
ENTP	should no longer print the paper called the New England Courant.'There was a consultation held in our printing-house amonghis friends, what he should do in this case.  Some proposed toevade the order by changing the name of the paper; but my brother,seeing inconveniences in that, it was finally concluded on as abetter way, to let it be printed for the future under the nameof BENJAMIN FRANKLIN; and to avoid the censure of the Assembly,that might fall on him as still printing it by his apprentice,the contrivance was that my old indenture should be return'd to me,with a full discharge on the back of it, to be shown on occasion,but to secure to him the benefit of my service, I was to sign newindentures for the remainder of the term, which were to be kept private.A very flimsy scheme it was; however, it was immediately executed,and the paper went on accordingly, under my name for several months.At length, a fresh difference arising between my brother and me,I took upon me to assert my freedom, presuming that he would notventure to produce the new indentures.  It was not fair in me totake this advantage, and this I therefore reckon one of the firsterrata of my life; but the unfairness of it weighed little with me,when under the impressions of resentment for the blows his passiontoo often urged him to bestow upon me, though he was otherwisenot an ill-natur'd man:  perhaps I was too saucy and provoking.When he found I would leave him, he took care to prevent my gettingemployment in any other printing-house of the town, by going roundand speaking to every master, who accordingly refus'd to give me work.I then thought of going to New York, as the nearest place wherethere was a printer; and I was rather inclin'd to leave Bostonwhen I reflected that I had already made myself a little obnoxiousto the governing party, and, from the arbitrary proceedings of theAssembly in my brother's case, it was likely I might, if I stay'd,soon bring myself into scrapes; and farther, that my indiscretedisputations about religion began to make me pointed at with horrorby good people as an infidel or atheist.  I determin'd on the point,but my father now siding with my brother, I was sensible that,if I attempted to go openly, means would be used to prevent me.My friend Collins, therefore, undertook to manage a little for me.He agreed with the captain of a New York sloop for my passage,under the notion of my being a young acquaintance of his, that hadgot a naughty girl with child, whose friends would compel me tomarry her, and therefore I could not appear or come away publicly.So I sold some of my books to raise a little money, was taken onboard privately, and as we had a fair wind, in three days I foundmyself in New York, near 300 miles from home, a boy of but 17,without the least recommendation to, or knowledge of any person inthe place, and with very little money in my pocket.My inclinations for the sea were by this time worne out, or Imight now have gratify'd them.  But, having a trade, and supposingmyself a pretty good workman, I offer'd my service to the printerin the place, old Mr. William Bradford, who had been the firstprinter in Pennsylvania, but removed from thence upon the quarrelof George Keith.  He could give me no employment, having little to do,and help enough already; but says he, 'My son at Philadelphiahas lately lost his principal hand, Aquila Rose, by death;if you go thither, I believe he may employ you.'  Philadelphia wasa hundred miles further; I set out, however, in a boat for Amboy,leaving my chest and things to follow me round by sea.In crossing the bay, we met with a squall that tore our rotten sailsto pieces, prevented our getting into the Kill and drove us uponLong Island.  In our way, a drunken Dutchman, who was a passenger too,fell overboard; when he was sinking, I reached through the waterto his shock pate, and drew him up, so that we got him in again.His ducking sobered him a little, and he went to sleep, taking firstout of his pocket a book, which he desir'd I would dry for him.It proved to be my old favorite author, Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress,in Dutch, finely printed on good paper, with copper cuts, a dress betterthan I had ever seen it wear in its own language.  I have since foundthat it has been translated into most of the languages of Europe,and suppose it has been more generally read than any other book,except perhaps the Bible.  Honest John was the first that I knowof who mix'd narration and dialogue; a method of writing very engagingto the reader, who in the most interesting parts finds himself,as it were, brought into the company and present at the discourse.De Foe in his Cruso, his Moll Flanders, Religious Courtship,Family Instructor, and other pieces, has imitated it with success;and Richardson has done the same, in his Pamela, etc.When we drew near the island, we found it was at a place where therecould be no landing, there being a great surff on the stony beach.So we dropt anchor, and swung round towards the shore.  Some peoplecame down to the water edge and hallow'd to us, as we did to them;but the wind was so high, and the surff so loud, that we couldnot hear so as to understand each other.  There were canoes onthe shore, and we made signs, and hallow'd that they should fetch us;but they either did not understand us, or thought it impracticable,so they went away, and night coming on, we had no remedy but to waittill the wind should abate; and, in the meantime, the boatman and Iconcluded to sleep, if we could; and so crowded into the scuttle,with the Dutchman, who was still wet, and the spray beating overthe head of our boat, leak'd thro' to us, so that we were soonalmost as wet as he.  In this manner we lay all night, with verylittle rest; but, the wind abating the next day, we made a shiftto reach Amboy before night, having been thirty hours on the water,without victuals, or any drink but a bottle of filthy rum,and the water we sail'd on being salt.In the evening I found myself very feverish, and went in to bed;but, having read somewhere that cold water drank plentifully was goodfor a fever, I follow'd the prescription, sweat plentiful most ofthe night, my fever left me, and in the morning, crossing the ferry,I proceeded on my journey on foot, having fifty miles to Burlington,where I was told I should find boats that would carry me the restof the way to Philadelphia.It rained very hard all the day; I was thoroughly soak'd, and by noona good deal tired; so I stopt at a poor inn, where I staid all night,beginning now to wish that I had never left home.  I cut so miserablea figure, too, that I found, by the questions ask'd me, I wassuspected to be some runaway servant, and in danger of being takenup on that suspicion.  However, I proceeded the next day, and gotin the evening to an inn, within eight or ten miles of Burlington,kept by one Dr. Brown.  He entered into conversation with me while Itook some refreshment, and, finding I had read a little, became verysociable and friendly.  Our acquaintance continu'd as long as heliv'd. He had been, I imagine, an itinerant doctor, for there was notown in England, or country in Europe, of which he could not givea very particular account.  He had some letters, and was ingenious,but much of an unbeliever, and wickedly undertook, some years after,to travestie the Bible in doggrel verse, as Cotton had done Virgil.By this means he set many of the facts in a very ridiculous light,and might have hurt weak minds if his work had been published;but it never was.At his house I lay that night, and the next morning reach'd Burlington,but had the mortification to find that the regular boats were gonea little before my coming, and no other expected to go before Tuesday,this being Saturday; wherefore I returned to an old woman in the town,of whom I had bought gingerbread to eat on the water, and ask'dher advice.  She invited me to lodge at her house till a passageby water should offer; and being tired with my foot travelling,I accepted the invitation.  She understanding I was a printer,would have had me stay at that town and follow my business,being ignorant of the stock necessary to begin with.  She wasvery hospitable, gave me a dinner of ox-cheek with great good will,accepting only a pot of ale in return; and I thought myselffixed till Tuesday should come.  However, walking in the eveningby the side of the river, a boat came by, which I found was goingtowards Philadelphia, with several people in her.  They took me in,and, as there was no wind, we row'd all the way; and about midnight,not having yet seen the city, some of the company were confidentwe must have passed it, and would row no farther; the others knewnot where we were; so we put toward the shore, got into a creek,landed near an old fence, with the rails of which we made a fire,the night being cold, in October, and there we remained till daylight.Then one of the company knew the place to be Cooper's Creek, a littleabove Philadelphia, which we saw as soon as we got out of the creek,and arriv'd there about eight or nine o'clock on the Sunday morning,and landed at the Market-street wharf.I have been the more particular in this description of my journey,and shall be so of my first entry into that city, that you mayin your mind compare such unlikely beginnings with the figureI have since made there.  I was in my working dress, my bestcloaths being to come round by sea.  I was dirty from my journey;my pockets were stuff'd out with shirts and stockings, and Iknew no soul nor where to look for lodging.  I was fatiguedwith travelling, rowing, and want of rest, I was very hungry;and my whole stock of cash consisted of a Dutch dollar, and abouta shilling in copper.  The latter I gave the people of the boatfor my passage, who at first refus'd it, on account of my rowing;but I insisted on their taking it.  A man being sometimes moregenerous when he has but a little money than when he has plenty,perhaps thro' fear of being thought to have but little.Then I walked up the street, gazing about till near the market-houseI met a boy with bread.  I had made many a meal on bread, and,inquiring where he got it, I went immediately to the baker'she directed me to, in Secondstreet, and ask'd for bisket,intending such as we had in Boston; but they, it seems, were notmade in Philadelphia.  Then I asked for a three-penny loaf,and was told they had none such.  So not considering or knowingthe difference of money, and the greater cheapness nor the namesof his bread, I made him give me three-penny worth of any sort.He gave me, accordingly, three great puffy rolls.  I was surpriz'dat the quantity, but took it, and, having no room in my pockets,walk'd off with a roll under each arm, and eating the other.  Thus Iwent up Market-street as far as Fourth-street, passing by the doorof Mr. Read, my future wife's father; when she, standing at the door,saw me, and thought I made, as I certainly did, a most awkward,ridiculous appearance.  Then I turned and went down Chestnut-street andpart of Walnut-street, eating my roll all the way, and, corning round,found myself again at Market-street wharf, near the boat I came in,to which I went for a draught of the river water; and, being filledwith one of my rolls, gave the other two to a woman and her child thatcame down the river in the boat with us, and were waiting to go farther.Thus refreshed, I walked again up the street, which by this time hadmany clean-dressed people in it, who were all walking the same way.I joined them, and thereby was led into the great meeting-house ofthe Quakers near the market.  I sat down among them, and, after lookinground awhile and hearing nothing said, being very drowsy thro'labor and want of rest the preceding night, I fell fast asleep,and continued so till the meeting broke up, when one was kindenough to rouse me.  This was, therefore, the first house I was in,or slept in, in Philadelphia.Walking down again toward the river, and, looking in the facesof people, I met a young Quaker man, whose countenance I lik'd, and,accosting him, requested he would tell me where a stranger couldget lodging.  We were then near the sign of the Three Mariners.'Here,' says he, 'is one place that entertains strangers, but itis not a reputable house; if thee wilt walk with me, I'll show theea better.'  He brought me to the Crooked Billet in Water-street. HereI got a dinner; and, while I was eating it, several sly questions wereasked me, as it seemed to be suspected from my youth and appearance,that I might be some runaway.After dinner, my sleepiness return'd, and being shown to a bed,I lay down without undressing, and slept till six in the evening,was call'd to supper, went to bed again very early, and sleptsoundly till next morning.  Then I made myself as tidy as I could,and went to Andrew Bradford the printer's. I found in the shopthe old man his father, whom I had seen at New York, and who,travelling on horseback, had got to Philadelphia before me.He introduc'd me to his son, who receiv'd me civilly, gave mea breakfast, but told me he did not at present want a hand,being lately suppli'd with one; but there was another printerin town, lately set up, one Keimer, who, perhaps, might employ me;if not, I should be welcome to lodge at his house, and he wouldgive me a little work to do now and then till fuller businessshould offer.The old gentleman said he would go with me to the new printer;and when we found him, 'Neighbor,' says Bradford, 'I have broughtto see you a young man of your business; perhaps you may want sucha one.'  He ask'd me a few questions, put a composing stick in myhand to see how I work'd, and then said he would employ me soon,though he had just then nothing for me to do; and, taking old Bradford,whom he had never seen before, to be one of the town's people thathad a good will for him, enter'd into a conversation on his presentundertaking and projects; while Bradford, not discovering that hewas the other printer's father, on Keimer's saying he expectedsoon to get the greatest part of the business into his own hands,drew him on by artful questions, and starting little doubts,to explain all his views, what interests he reli'd on, and in whatmanner he intended to proceed.  I, who stood by and heard all,saw immediately that one of them was a crafty old sophister,and the other a mere novice.  Bradford left me with Keimer, who wasgreatly surpris'd when I told him who the old man was.Keimer's printing-house, I found, consisted of an old shatter'd press,and one small, worn-out font of English which he was then using himself,composing an Elegy on Aquila Rose, before mentioned, an ingeniousyoung man, of excellent character, much respected in the town,clerk of the Assembly, and a pretty poet.  Keimer made verses too,but very indifferently.  He could not be said to write them, for hismanner was to compose them in the types directly out of his head.So there being no copy, but one pair of cases, and the Elegylikely to require all the letter, no one could help him.I endeavor'd to put his press (which he had not yet us'd, and ofwhich he understood nothing) into order fit to be work'd with;and, promising to come and print off his Elegy as soon as heshould have got it ready, I return'd to Bradford's, who gave mea little job to do for the present, and there I lodged and dieted,A few days after, Keimer sent for me to print off the Elegy.And now he had got another pair of cases, and a pamphlet to reprint,on which he set me to work.These two printers I found poorly qualified for their business.Bradford had not been bred to it, and was very illiterate;and Keimer, tho' something of a scholar, was a mere compositor,knowing nothing of presswork.  He had been one of the French prophets,and could act their enthusiastic agitations.  At this time he didnot profess any particular religion, but something of all on occasion;was very ignorant of the world, and had, as I afterward found,a good deal of the knave in his composition.  He did not like mylodging at Bradford's while I work'd with him.  He had a house,indeed, but without furniture, so he could not lodge me; but he gotme a lodging at Mr. Read's, before mentioned, who was the ownerof his house; and, my chest and clothes being come by this time,I made rather a more respectable appearance in the eyes of Miss Readthan I had done when she first happen'd to see me eating my roll inthe street.I began now to have some acquaintance among the young people ofthe town, that were lovers of reading, with whom I spent my eveningsvery pleasantly; and gaining money by my industry and frugality,I lived very agreeably, forgetting Boston as much as I could,and not desiring that any there should know where I resided,except my friend Collins, who was in my secret, and kept it when Iwrote to him.  At length, an incident happened that sent me backagain much sooner than I had intended.  I had a brother-in-law,Robert Holmes, master of a sloop that traded between Bostonand Delaware.  He being at Newcastle, forty miles below Philadelphia,heard there of me, and wrote me a letter mentioning the concernof my friends in Boston at my abrupt departure, assuring me of theirgood will to me, and that every thing would be accommodated to mymind if I would return, to which he exhorted me very earnestly.I wrote an answer to his letter, thank'd him for his advice,but stated my reasons for quitting Boston fully and in such a lightas to convince him I was not so wrong as he had apprehended.Sir William Keith, governor of the province, was then at Newcastle,and Captain Holmes, happening to be in company with him when myletter came to hand, spoke to him of me, and show'd him the letter.The governor read it, and seem'd surpris'd when he was told my age.He said I appear'd a young man of promising parts, and thereforeshould be encouraged; the printers at Philadelphia were wretched ones;and, if I would set up there, he made no doubt I should succeed;for his part, he would procure me the public business, and do meevery other service in his power.  This my brother-in-law afterwardstold me in Boston, but I knew as yet nothing of it; when, one day,Keimer and I being at work together near the window, we saw thegovernor and another gentleman (which proved to be Colonel French,of Newcastle), finely dress'd, come directly across the street toour house, and heard them at the door.Keimer ran down immediately, thinking it a visit to him;but the governor inquir'd for me, came up, and with a condescensionof politeness I had been quite unus'd to, made me many compliments,desired to be acquainted with me, blam'd me kindly for nothaving made myself known to him when I first came to the place,and would have me away with him to the tavern, where he was goingwith Colonel French to taste, as he said, some excellent Madeira.I was not a little surprised, and Keimer star'd like a pig poison'd.I went, however, with the governor and Colonel French to a tavern,at the corner of Third-street, and over the Madeira he propos'd mysetting up my business, laid before me the probabilities of success,and both he and Colonel French assur'd me I should have their interestand influence in procuring the public business of both governments.On my doubting whether my father would assist me in it, Sir Williamsaid he would give me a letter to him, in which he would statethe advantages, and he did not doubt of prevailing with him.So it was concluded I should return to Boston in the first vessel,with the governor's letter recommending me to my father.In the mean time the intention was to be kept a secret, and Iwent on working with Keimer as usual, the governor sending for menow and then to dine with him, a very great honor I thought it,and conversing with me in the most affable, familiar, and friendlymanner imaginable.About the end of April, 1724, a little vessel offer'd for Boston.I took leave of Keimer as going to see my friends.  The governor gaveme an ample letter, saying many flattering things of me to my father,and strongly recommending the project of my setting up at Philadelphiaas a thing that must make my fortune.  We struck on a shoal in goingdown the bay, and sprung a leak; we had a blustering time at sea,and were oblig'd to pump almost continually, at which I took my turn.We arriv'd safe, however, at Boston in about a fortnight.  I hadbeen absent seven months, and my friends had heard nothing of me;for my br.  Holmes was not yet return'd, and had not written about me.My unexpected appearance surpriz'd the family; all were, however,very glad to see me, and made me welcome, except my brother.I went to see him at his printing-house. I was better dress'd than everwhile in his service, having a genteel new suit from head to foot,a watch, and my pockets lin'd with near five pounds sterling in silver.He receiv'd me not very frankly, look'd me all over, and turn'd to hiswork again.The journeymen were inquisitive where I had been, what sort of acountry it was, and how I lik'd it.  I prais'd it much, the happylife I led in it, expressing strongly my intention of returningto it; and, one of them asking what kind of money we had there,I produc'd a handful of silver, and spread it before them,which was a kind of raree-show they had not been us'd to, paper beingthe money of Boston.  Then I took an opportunity of letting them seemy watch; and, lastly (my brother still grum and sullen), I gave thema piece of eight to drink, and took my leave.  This visit of mineoffended him extreamly; for, when my mother some time after spoketo him of a reconciliation, and of her wishes to see us on goodterms together, and that we might live for the future as brothers,he said I had insulted him in such a manner before his people thathe could never forget or forgive it.  In this, however, he was mistaken.My father received the governor's letter with some apparent surprise,but said little of it to me for some days, when Capt. Holmes returninghe showed it to him, ask'd him if he knew Keith, and what kind ofman he was; adding his opinion that he must be of small discretionto think of setting a boy up in business who wanted yet three yearsof being at man's estate.  Holmes said what he could in favorof the project, but my father was clear in the impropriety of it,and at last gave a flat denial to it.  Then he wrote a civil letterto Sir William, thanking him for the patronage he had so kindlyoffered me, but declining to assist me as yet in setting up, I being,in his opinion, too young to be trusted with the management of abusiness so important, and for which the preparation must be so expensive.My friend and companion Collins, who was a clerk in the post-office,pleas'd with the account I gave him of my new country, determined togo thither also; and, while I waited for my father's determination,he set out before me by land to Rhode Island, leaving his books,which were a pretty collection of mathematicks and natural philosophy,to come with mine and me to New York, where he propos'd to waitfor me.My father, tho' he did not approve Sir William's proposition,was yet pleas'd that I had been able to obtain so advantageous acharacter from a person of such note where I had resided, and that Ihad been so industrious and careful as to equip myself so handsomelyin so short a time; therefore, seeing no prospect of an accommodationbetween my brother and me, he gave his consent to my returning againto Philadelphia, advis'd me to behave respectfully to the people there,endeavor to obtain the general esteem, and avoid lampooningand libeling, to which he thought I had too much inclination;telling me, that by steady industry and a prudent parsimony I mightsave enough by the time I was one-and-twenty to set me up; and that,if I came near the matter, he would help me out with the rest.This was all I could obtain, except some small gifts as tokensof his and my mother's love, when I embark'd again for New York,now with their approbation and their blessing.The sloop putting in at Newport, Rhode Island, I visited my brother John,who had been married and settled there some years.  He receivedme very affectionately, for he always lov'd me.  A friend of his,one Vernon, having some money due to him in Pensilvania, about thirty-fivepounds currency, desired I would receive it for him, and keep ittill I had his directions what to remit it in.  Accordingly, he gaveme an order.  This afterwards occasion'd me a good deal of uneasiness.At Newport we took in a number of passengers for New York,among which were two young women, companions, and a grave, sensible,matron-like Quaker woman, with her attendants.  I had shown an obligingreadiness to do her some little services, which impress'd her Isuppose with a degree of good will toward me; therefore, when shesaw a daily growing familiarity between me and the two young women,which they appear'd to encourage, she took me aside, and said:'Young man, I am concern'd for thee, as thou has no friend with thee,and seems not to know much of the world, or of the snares youthis expos'd to; depend upon it, those are very bad women; I cansee it in all their actions; and if thee art not upon thy guard,they will draw thee into some danger; they are strangers to thee,and I advise thee, in a friendly concern for thy welfare, to have noacquaintance with them.'  As I seem'd at first not to think so illof them as she did, she mentioned some things she had observ'd andheard that had escap'd my notice, but now convinc'd me she was right.I thank'd her for her kind advice, and promis'd to follow it.When we arriv'd at New York, they told me where they liv'd, and invitedme to come and see them; but I avoided it, and it was well I did;for the next day the captain miss'd a silver spoon and some other things,that had been taken out of his cabbin, and, knowing that these werea couple of strumpets, he got a warrant to search their lodgings,found the stolen goods, and had the thieves punish'd. So, tho'we had escap'd a sunken rock, which we scrap'd upon in the passage,I thought this escape of rather more importance to me.At New York I found my friend Collins, who had arriv'd there some timebefore me.  We had been intimate from children, and had read the samebooks together; but he had the advantage of more time for readingand studying, and a wonderful genius for mathematical learning,in which he far outstript me.  While I liv'd in Boston most of my hoursof leisure for conversation were spent with him, and he continu'da sober as well as an industrious lad; was much respected for hislearning by several of the clergy and other gentlemen, and seemedto promise making a good figure in life.  But, during my absence,he had acquir'd a habit of sotting with brandy; and I found by hisown account, and what I heard from others, that he had been drunkevery day since his arrival at New York, and behav'd very oddly.He had gam'd, too, and lost his money, so that I was oblig'd todischarge his lodgings, and defray his expenses to and at Philadelphia,which prov'd extremely inconvenient to me.The then governor of New York, Burnet (son of Bishop Burnet),hearing from the captain that a young man, one of his passengers,had a great many books, desir'd he would bring me to see him.I waited upon him accordingly, and should have taken Collinswith me but that he was not sober.  The gov'r. treated me withgreat civility, show'd me his library, which was a very large one,and we had a good deal of conversation about books and authors.This was the second governor who had done me the honor to take noticeof me; which, to a poor boy like me, was very pleasing.We proceeded to Philadelphia.  I received on the way Vernon's money,without which we could hardly have finish'd our journey.  Collins wishedto be employ'd in some counting-house, but, whether they discover'dhis dramming by his breath, or by his behaviour, tho' he hadsome recommendations, he met with no success in any application,and continu'd lodging and boarding at the same house with me,and at my expense.  Knowing I had that money of Vernon's, he wascontinually borrowing of me, still promising repayment as soonas he should be in business.  At length he had got so much of itthat I was distress'd to think what I should do in case of beingcall'd on to remit it.His drinking continu'd, about which we sometimes quarrell'd;, for,when a little intoxicated, he was very fractious.  Once, in a boaton the Delaware with some other young men, he refused to rowin his turn.  'I will be row'd home,' says he.  'We will notrow you,' says I. 'You must, or stay all night on the water,'says he, 'just as you please.'  The others said, 'Let us row;what signifies it?'  But, my mind being soured with his other conduct,I continu'd to refuse.  So he swore he would make me row,or throw me overboard; and coming along, stepping on the thwarts,toward me, when he came up and struck at me, I clapped my hand underhis crutch, and, rising, pitched him head-foremost into the river.I knew he was a good swimmer, and so was under little concernabout him; but before he could get round to lay hold of the boat,we had with a few strokes pull'd her out of his reach; and ever when hedrew near the boat, we ask'd if he would row, striking a few strokesto slide her away from him.  He was ready to die with vexation,and obstinately would not promise to row.  However, seeing him at lastbeginning to tire, we lifted him in and brought him home drippingwet in the evening.  We hardly exchang'd a civil word afterwards,and a West India captain, who had a commission to procure a tutorfor the sons of a gentleman at Barbadoes, happening to meet with him,agreed to carry him thither.  He left me then, promising to remit methe first money he should receive in order to discharge the debt;but I never heard of him after.The breaking into this money of Vernon's was one of the first greaterrata of my life; and this affair show'd that my father was not muchout in his judgment when he suppos'd me too young to manage businessof importance.  But Sir William, on reading his letter, said he wastoo prudent.  There was great difference in persons; and discretiondid not always accompany years, nor was youth always without it.'And since he will not set you up,' says he, 'I will do it myself.Give me an inventory of the things necessary to be had from England,and I will send for them.  You shall repay me when you are able;I am resolv'd to have a good printer here, and I am sure youmust succeed.'  This was spoken with such an appearance of cordiality,that I had not the least doubt of his meaning what he said.I had hitherto kept the proposition of my setting up, a secretin Philadelphia, and I still kept it.  Had it been known that Idepended on the governor, probably some friend, that knew him better,would have advis'd me not to rely on him, as I afterwards heard itas his known character to be liberal of promises which he never meantto keep.  Yet, unsolicited as he was by me, how could I think hisgenerous offers insincere?  I believ'd him one of the best men inthe world.I presented him an inventory of a little print'g-house, amountingby my computation to about one hundred pounds sterling.  He lik'd it,but ask'd me if my being on the spot in England to chuse the types,and see that every thing was good of the kind, might not be ofsome advantage.  'Then,' says he, 'when there, you may make acquaintances,and establish correspondences in the bookselling and stationery way.'I agreed that this might be advantageous.  'Then,' says he,'get yourself ready to go with Annis;' which was the annual ship,and the only one at that time usually passing between Londonand Philadelphia.  But it would be some months before Annis sail'd,so I continu'd working with Keimer, fretting about the money Collinshad got from me, and in daily apprehensions of being call'd uponby Vernon, which, however, did not happen for some years after.I believe I have omitted mentioning that, in my first voyagefrom Boston, being becalm'd off Block Island, our people setabout catching cod, and hauled up a great many.  Hitherto I hadstuck to my resolution of not eating animal food, and on thisoccasion consider'd, with my master Tryon, the taking everyfish as a kind of unprovoked murder, since none of them had,or ever could do us any injury that might justify the slaughter.All this seemed very reasonable.  But I had formerly been a greatlover of fish, and, when this came hot out of the frying-pan, itsmelt admirably well.  I balanc'd some time between principleand inclination, till I recollected that, when the fish were opened,I saw smaller fish taken out of their stomachs; then thought I,'If you eat one another, I don't see why we mayn't eat you.'  So Idin'd upon cod very heartily, and continued to eat with other people,returning only now and then occasionally to a vegetable diet.So convenient a thing it is to be a reasonable creature, since itenables one to find or make a reason for everything one has a mindto do.Keimer and I liv'd on a pretty good familiar footing, and agreedtolerably well, for he suspected nothing of my setting up.He retained a great deal of his old enthusiasms and lov'd argumentation.We therefore had many disputations.  I used to work him so with mySocratic method, and had trepann'd him so often by questions apparentlyso distant from any point we had in hand, and yet by degrees leadto the point, and brought him into difficulties and contradictions,that at last he grew ridiculously cautious, and would hardly answerme the most common question, without asking first, 'What do youintend to infer from that?'  However, it gave him so high an opinionof my abilities in the confuting way, that he seriously proposed mybeing his colleague in a project he had of setting up a new sect.He was to preach the doctrines, and I was to confound all opponents.When he came to explain with me upon the doctrines, I found severalconundrums which I objected to, unless I might have my way a little too,and introduce some of mine.Keimer wore his beard at full length, because somewhere in the Mosaiclaw it is said, 'Thou shalt not mar the corners of thy beard.'He likewise kept the Seventh day, Sabbath; and these two points wereessentials with him.  I dislik'd both; but agreed to admit them uponcondition of his adopting the doctrine of using no animal food.'I doubt,' said he, 'my constitution will not bear that.'  I assur'dhim it would, and that he would be the better for it.  He was usually agreat glutton, and I promised myself some diversion in half starving him.He agreed to try the practice, if I would keep him company.I did so, and we held it for three months.  We had our victualsdress'd, and brought to us regularly by a woman in the neighborhood,who had from me a list of forty dishes to be prepar'd for us atdifferent times, in all which there was neither fish, flesh, nor fowl,and the whim suited me the better at this time from the cheapnessof it, not costing us above eighteenpence sterling each per week.I have since kept several Lents most strictly, leaving the commondiet for that, and that for the common, abruptly, without theleast inconvenience, so that I think there is little in the adviceof making those changes by easy gradations.  I went on pleasantly,but poor Keimer suffered grievously, tired of the project,long'd for the flesh-pots of Egypt, and order'd a roast pig.He invited me and two women friends to dine with him; but, it beingbrought too soon upon table, he could not resist the temptation,and ate the whole before we came.I had made some courtship during this time to Miss Read.  I had agreat respect and affection for her, and had some reason to believeshe had the same for me; but, as I was about to take a long voyage,and we were both very young, only a little above eighteen,it was thought most prudent by her mother to prevent our going toofar at present, as a marriage, if it was to take place, would bemore convenient after my return, when I should be, as I expected,set up in my business.  Perhaps, too, she thought my expectationsnot so well founded as I imagined them to be.My chief acquaintances at this time were Charles Osborne, Joseph Watson,and James Ralph, all lovers of reading.  The two first were clerksto an eminent scrivener or conveyancer in the town, Charles Brogden;the other was clerk to a merchant.  Watson was a pious, sensibleyoung man, of great integrity; the others rather more lax in theirprinciples of religion, particularly Ralph, who, as well as Collins,had been unsettled by me, for which they both made me suffer.Osborne was sensible, candid, frank; sincere and affectionateto his friends; but, in literary matters, too fond of criticising.Ralph was ingenious, genteel in his manners, and extremely eloquent;I think I never knew a prettier talker.  Both of them greatadmirers of poetry, and began to try their hands in little pieces.Many pleasant walks we four had together on Sundays into the woods,near Schuylkill, where we read to one another, and conferr'd on whatwe read.Ralph was inclin'd to pursue the study of poetry, not doubtingbut he might become eminent in it, and make his fortune by it,alleging that the best poets must, when they first began to write,make as many faults as he did.  Osborne dissuaded him, assur'd himhe had no genius for poetry, and advis'd him to think of nothingbeyond the business he was bred to; that, in the mercantile way,tho' he had no stock, he might, by his diligence and punctuality,recommend himself to employment as a factor, and in time acquirewherewith to trade on his own account.  I approv'd the amusing one'sself with poetry now and then, so far as to improve one's language,but no farther.On this it was propos'd that we should each of us, at ournext meeting, produce a piece of our own composing, in order toimprove by our mutual observations, criticisms, and corrections.As language and expression were what we had in view, we excludedall considerations of invention by agreeing that the taskshould be a version of the eighteenth Psalm, which describesthe descent of a Deity.  When the time of our meeting drew nigh,Ralph called on me first, and let me know his piece was ready.I told him I had been busy, and, having little inclination,had done nothing.  He then show'd me his piece for my opinion,and I much approv'd it, as it appear'd to me to have great merit.'Now,' says he, 'Osborne never will allow the least merit in anything of mine, but makes 1000 criticisms out of mere envy.  He isnot so jealous of you; I wish, therefore, you would take this piece,and produce it as yours; I will pretend not to have had time,and so produce nothing.  We shall then see what he will say to it.'It was agreed, and I immediately transcrib'd it, that it might appearin my own hand.We met; Watson's performance was read; there were some beautiesin it, but many defects.  Osborne's was read; it was much better;Ralph did it justice; remarked some faults, but applaudedthe beauties.  He himself had nothing to produce.  I was backward;seemed desirous of being excused; had not had sufficient timeto correct, etc.; but no excuse could be admitted; produce I must.It was read and repeated; Watson and Osborne gave up the contest,and join'd in applauding it.  Ralph only made some criticisms,and propos'd some amendments; but I defended my text.  Osborne wasagainst Ralph, and told him he was no better a critic than poet,so he dropt the argument.  As they two went home together,Osborne expressed himself still more strongly in favor of what hethought my production; having restrain'd himself before, as he said,lest I should think it flattery.  'But who would have imagin'd,'said he, 'that 
ENTP	 had been capable of such a performance;such painting, such force, such fire!  He has even improv'd the original.In his common conversation he seems to have no choice of words;he hesitates and blunders; and yet, good God! how he writes!'When we next met, Ralph discovered the trick we had plaid him,and Osborne was a little laught at.This transaction fixed Ralph in his resolution of becoming a poet.I did all I could to dissuade him from it, but he continuedscribbling verses till Pope cured him.  He became, however, a prettygood prose writer.  More of him hereafter.  But, as I may not haveoccasion again to mention the other two, I shall just remark here,that Watson died in my arms a few years after, much lamented,being the best of our set.  Osborne went to the West Indies,where he became an eminent lawyer and made money, but died young.He and I had made a serious agreement, that the one who happen'dfirst to die should, if possible, make a friendly visit to the other,and acquaint him how he found things in that separate state.  But henever fulfill'd his promise.The governor, seeming to like my company, had me frequently to his house,and his setting me up was always mention'd as a fixed thing.I was to take with me letters recommendatory to a number ofhis friends, besides the letter of credit to furnish me with thenecessary money for purchasing the press and types, paper, etc.For these letters I was appointed to call at different times,when they were to be ready, but a future time was still named.Thus he went on till the ship, whose departure too had been severaltimes postponed, was on the point of sailing.  Then, when I call'dto take my leave and receive the letters, his secretary, Dr. Bard,came out to me and said the governor was extremely busy in writing,but would be down at Newcastle before the ship, and there the letterswould be delivered to me.Ralph, though married, and having one child, had determined toaccompany me in this voyage.  It was thought he intended to establisha correspondence, and obtain goods to sell on commission; but Ifound afterwards, that, thro' some discontent with his wife's relations,he purposed to leave her on their hands, and never return again.Having taken leave of my friends, and interchang'd some promiseswith Miss Read, I left Philadelphia in the ship, which anchor'dat Newcastle.  The governor was there; but when I went to his lodging,the secretary came to me from him with the civillest message inthe world, that he could not then see me, being engaged in businessof the utmost importance, but should send the letters to me on board,wish'd me heartily a good voyage and a speedy return, etc.I returned on board a little puzzled, but still not doubting.Mr. Andrew Hamilton, a famous lawyer of Philadelphia, had takenpassage in the same ship for himself and son, and with Mr. Denham,a Quaker merchant, and Messrs.  Onion and Russel, masters of aniron work in Maryland, had engag'd the great cabin; so that Ralphand I were forced to take up with a berth in the steerage,and none on board knowing us, were considered as ordinary persons.But Mr. Hamilton and his son (it was James, since governor)return'd from Newcastle to Philadelphia, the father being recall'dby a great fee to plead for a seized ship; and, just before wesail'd, Colonel French coming on board, and showing me great respect,I was more taken notice of, and, with my friend Ralph, invited bythe other gentlemen to come into the cabin, there being now room.Accordingly, we remov'd thither.Understanding that Colonel French had brought on board thegovernor's despatches, I ask'd the captain for those lettersthat were to be under my care.  He said all were put into the bagtogether and he could not then come at them; but, before we landedin England, I should have an opportunity of picking them out;so I was satisfied for the present, and we proceeded on our voyage.We had a sociable company in the cabin, and lived uncommonly well,having the addition of all Mr. Hamilton's stores, who had laidin plentifully.  In this passage Mr. Denham contracted a friendshipfor me that continued during his life.  The voyage was otherwisenot a pleasant one, as we had a great deal of bad weather.When we came into the Channel, the captain kept his word with me, and gaveme an opportunity of examining the bag for the governor's letters.I found none upon which my name was put as under my care.  I pickedout six or seven, that, by the handwriting, I thought might be thepromised letters, especially as one of them was directed to Basket,the king's printer, and another to some stationer.  We arriv'din London the 24th of December, 1724.  I waited upon the stationer,who came first in my way, delivering the letter as from Governor Keith.'I don't know such a person,' says he; but, opening the letter, 'O! thisis from Riddlesden.  I have lately found him to be a compleat rascal,and I will have nothing to do with him, nor receive any lettersfrom him.'  So, putting the letter into my hand, he turn'd on hisheel and left me to serve some customer.  I was surprized to findthese were not the governor's letters; and, after recollectingand comparing circumstances, I began to doubt his sincerity.I found my friend Denham, and opened the whole affair to him.He let me into Keith's character; told me there was not the leastprobability that he had written any letters for me; that no one,who knew him, had the smallest dependence on him; and he laught atthe notion of the governor's giving me a letter of credit, having,as he said, no credit to give.  On my expressing some concernabout what I should do, he advised me to endeavor getting someemployment in the way of my business.  'Among the printers here,'said he, 'you will improve yourself, and when you return to America,you will set up to greater advantage.'We both of us happen'd to know, as well as the stationer,that Riddlesden, the attorney, was a very knave.  He had halfruin'd Miss Read's father by persuading him to be bound for him.By this letter it appear'd there was a secret scheme on foot tothe prejudice of Hamilton (suppos'd to be then coming over with us);and that Keith was concerned in it with Riddlesden.  Denham, who wasa friend of Hamilton's thought he ought to be acquainted with it;so, when he arriv'd in England, which was soon after, partly fromresentment and ill-will to Keith and Riddlesden, and partly fromgood-will to him, I waited on him, and gave him the letter.He thank'd me cordially, the information being of importance to him;and from that time he became my friend, greatly to my advantageafterwards on many occasions.But what shall we think of a governor's playing such pitiful tricks,and imposing so grossly on a poor ignorant boy!  It was a habit hehad acquired.  He wish'd to please everybody; and, having littleto give, he gave expectations.  He was otherwise an ingenious,sensible man, a pretty good writer, and a good governor forthe people, tho' not for his constituents, the proprietaries,whose instructions he sometimes disregarded.  Several of our bestlaws were of his planning and passed during his administration.Ralph and I were inseparable companions.  We took lodgingstogether in Little Britain at three shillings and sixpence a week--as much as we could then afford.  He found some relations,but they were poor, and unable to assist him.  He now let me knowhis intentions of remaining in London, and that he never meantto return to Philadelphia.  He had brought no money with him,the whole he could muster having been expended in paying his passage.I had fifteen pistoles; so he borrowed occasionally of me to subsist,while he was looking out for business.  He first endeavored to getinto the playhouse, believing himself qualify'd for an actor;but Wilkes, to whom he apply'd, advis'd him candidly not to thinkof that employment, as it was impossible be should succeed in it.Then he propos'd to Roberts, a publisher in Paternoster Row, to writefor him a weekly paper like the Spectator, on certain conditions,which Roberts did not approve.  Then he endeavored to get employmentas a hackney writer, to copy for the stationers and lawyers aboutthe Temple, but could find no vacancy.I immediately got into work at Palmer's, then a famous printing-housein Bartholomew Close, and here I continu'd near a year.  I waspretty diligent, but spent with Ralph a good deal of my earningsin going to plays and other places of amusement.  We had togetherconsumed all my pistoles, and now just rubbed on from hand to mouth.He seem'd quite to forget his wife and child, and I, by degrees,my engagements with Miss Read, to whom I never wrote more thanone letter, and that was to let her know I was not likely soonto return.  This was another of the great errata of my life,which I should wish to correct if I were to live it over again.In fact, by our expenses, I was constantly kept unable to paymy passage.At Palmer's I was employed in composing for the second editionof Wollaston's 'Religion of Nature.'  Some of his reasoningsnot appearing to me well founded, I wrote a little metaphysicalpiece in which I made remarks on them.  It was entitled 'ADissertation on Liberty and Necessity, Pleasure and Pain.'I inscribed it to my friend Ralph; I printed a small number.It occasion'd my being more consider'd by Mr. Palmer as a youngman of some ingenuity, tho' he seriously expostulated with me uponthe principles of my pamphlet, which to him appear'd abominable.My printing this pamphlet was another erratum.  While I lodg'd inLittle Britain, I made an acquaintance with one Wilcox, a bookseller,whose shop was at the next door.  He had an immense collectionof second-hand books.  Circulating libraries were not then in use;but we agreed that, on certain reasonable terms, which I havenow forgotten, I might take, read, and return any of his books.This I esteem'd a great advantage, and I made as much use of it asI could.My pamphlet by some means falling into the hands of one Lyons, a surgeon,author of a book entitled 'The Infallibility of Human Judgment,'it occasioned an acquaintance between us.  He took great noticeof me, called on me often to converse on those subjects, carried meto the Horns, a pale alehouse in ---- Lane, Cheapside, and introducedme to Dr. Mandeville, author of the 'Fable of the Bees,' who hada club there, of which he was the soul, being a most facetious,entertaining companion.  Lyons, too, introduced me to Dr. Pemberton,at Batson's Coffee-house, who promis'd to give me an opportunity,some time or other, of seeing Sir Isaac Newton, of which I wasextreamely desirous; but this never happened.I had brought over a few curiosities, among which the principalwas a purse made of the asbestos, which purifies by fire.Sir Hans Sloane heard of it, came to see me, and invited me to hishouse in Bloomsbury Square, where he show'd me all his curiosities,and persuaded me to let him add that to the number, for which hepaid me handsomely.In our house there lodg'd a young woman, a milliner, who, I think,had a shop in the Cloisters.  She had been genteelly bred, was sensibleand lively, and of most pleasing conversation.  Ralph read playsto her in the evenings, they grew intimate, she took another lodging,and he followed her.  They liv'd together some time; but, he beingstill out of business, and her income not sufficient to maintainthem with her child, he took a resolution of going from London,to try for a country school, which he thought himself well qualifiedto undertake, as he wrote an excellent hand, and was a masterof arithmetic and accounts.  This, however, he deemed a businessbelow him, and confident of future better fortune, when he shouldbe unwilling to have it known that he once was so meanly employed,he changed his name, and did me the honor to assume mine; for I soonafter had a letter from him, acquainting me that he was settledin a small village (in Berkshire, I think it was, where he taughtreading and writing to ten or a dozen boys, at sixpence each perweek), recommending Mrs. T---- to my care, and desiring me to writeto him, directing for Mr. 
ENTP	, schoolmaster, at such a place.He continued to write frequently, sending me large specimensof an epic poem which he was then composing, and desiring myremarks and corrections.  These I gave him from time to time,but endeavor'd rather to discourage his proceeding.  One of Young'sSatires was then just published.  I copy'd and sent him a greatpart of it, which set in a strong light the folly of pursuingthe Muses with any hope of advancement by them.  All was in vain;sheets of the poem continued to come by every post.  In the mean time,Mrs. T----, having on his account lost her friends and business,was often in distresses, and us'd to send for me, and borrowwhat I could spare to help her out of them.  I grew fond ofher company, and, being at that time under no religious restraint,and presuming upon my importance to her, I attempted familiarities(another erratum) which she repuls'd with a proper resentment,and acquainted him with my behaviour.  This made a breach between us;and, when he returned again to London, he let me know he thoughtI had cancell'd all the obligations he had been under to me.So I found I was never to expect his repaying me what I lent to him,or advanc'd for him.  This, however, was not then of much consequence,as he was totally unable; and in the loss of his friendship I foundmyself relieved from a burthen.  I now began to think of gettinga little money beforehand, and, expecting better work, I left Palmer'sto work at Watts's, near Lincoln's Inn Fields, a still greaterprinting-house. Here I continued all the rest of my stay in London.At my first admission into this printing-house I took to workingat press, imagining I felt a want of the bodily exercise I had beenus'd to in America, where presswork is mix'd with composing.I drank only water; the other workmen, near fifty in number,were great guzzlers of beer.  On occasion, I carried up and downstairs a large form of types in each hand, when others carriedbut one in both hands.  They wondered to see, from this andseveral instances, that the Water-American, as they called me,was stronger than themselves, who drank strong beer!  We had analehouse boy who attended always in the house to supply the workmen.My companion at the press drank every day a pint before breakfast,a pint at breakfast with his bread and cheese, a pint betweenbreakfast and dinner, a pint at dinner, a pint in the afternoonabout six o'clock, and another when he had done his day's work.I thought it a detestable custom; but it was necessary, he suppos'd,to drink strong beer, that he might be strong to labor.  I endeavoredto convince him that the bodily strength afforded by beer couldonly be in proportion to the grain or flour of the barley dissolvedin the water of which it was made; that there was more flour in apennyworth of bread; and therefore, if he would eat that with a pintof water, it would give him more strength than a quart of beer.He drank on, however, and had four or five shillings to payout of his wages every Saturday night for that muddling liquor;an expense I was free from.  And thus these poor devils keepthemselves always under.Watts, after some weeks, desiring to have me in the composing-room, I leftthe pressmen; a new bien venu or sum for drink, being five shillings,was demanded of me by the compositors.  I thought it an imposition,as I had paid below; the master thought so too, and forbad my paying it.I stood out two or three weeks, was accordingly considered asan excommunicate, and bad so many little pieces of private mischiefdone me, by mixing my sorts, transposing my pages, breaking my matter,etc., etc., if I were ever so little out of the room, and allascribed to the chappel ghost, which they said ever haunted those notregularly admitted, that, notwithstanding the master's protection,I found myself oblig'd to comply and pay the money, convinc'd of thefolly of being on ill terms with those one is to live with continually.I was now on a fair footing with them, and soon acquir'dconsiderable influence.  I propos'd some reasonable alterationsin their chappel<4> laws, and carried them against all opposition.From my example, a great part of them left their muddling breakfastof beer, and bread, and cheese, finding they could with me besuppli'd from a neighboring house with a large porringer of hotwater-gruel, sprinkled with pepper, crumbl'd with bread, and a bitof butter in it, for the price of a pint of beer, viz., threehalf-pence. This was a more comfortable as well as cheaper breakfast,and kept their heads clearer.  Those who continued sotting with beerall day, were often, by not paying, out of credit at the alehouse,and us'd to make interest with me to get beer; their light, as theyphrased it, being out.  I watch'd the pay-table on Saturday night,and collected what I stood engag'd for them, having to pay sometimesnear thirty shillings a week on their account.  This, and my beingesteem'd a pretty good riggite, that is, a jocular verbal satirist,supported my consequence in the society.  My constant attendance(I never making a St. Monday) recommended me to the master;and my uncommon quickness at composing occasioned my being putupon all work of dispatch, which was generally better paid.So I went on now very agreeably.     <4> 'A printing-house is always called a chapel by the         workmen, the origin of which appears to have been that         printing was first carried on in England in an ancient         chapel converted into a printing-house, and the title         has been preserved by tradition.  The bien venu among         the printers answers to the terms entrance and footing         among mechanics; thus a journeyman, on entering a         printing-house, was accustomed to pay one or more gallons         of beer for the good of the chapel;  this custom was         falling into disuse thirty years ago; it is very properly         rejected entirely in the United States.'--W. T. F.My lodging in Little Britain being too remote, I found anotherin Duke-street, opposite to the Romish Chapel.  It was two pairof stairs backwards, at an Italian warehouse.  A widow lady keptthe house; she had a daughter, and a maid servant, and a journeymanwho attended the warehouse, but lodg'd abroad.  After sending to inquiremy character at the house where I last lodg'd she agreed to takeme in at the same rate, 3s.  6d.  per week; cheaper, as she said,from the protection she expected in having a man lodge in the house.She was a widow, an elderly woman; had been bred a Protestant,being a clergyman's daughter, but was converted to the Catholicreligion by her husband, whose memory she much revered; had lived muchamong people of distinction, and knew a thousand anecdotes of themas far back as the times of Charles the Second.  She was lame in herknees with the gout, and, therefore, seldom stirred out of her room,so sometimes wanted company; and hers was so highly amusing to me,that I was sure to spend an evening with her whenever she desired it.Our supper was only half an anchovy each, on a very little stripof bread and butter, and half a pint of ale between us; but theentertainment was in her conversation.  My always keeping good hours,and giving little trouble in the family, made her unwilling to partwith me; so that, when I talk'd of a lodging I had heard of, nearermy business, for two shillings a week, which, intent as I now wason saving money, made some difference, she bid me not think of it,for she would abate me two shillings a week for the future; so Iremained with her at one shilling and sixpence as long as I staidin London.In a garret of her house there lived a maiden lady of seventy,in the most retired manner, of whom my landlady gave me this account:that she was a Roman Catholic, had been sent abroad when young,and lodg'd in a nunnery with an intent of becoming a nun; but,the country not agreeing with her, she returned to England, where,there being no nunnery, she had vow'd to lead the life of a nun,as near as might be done in those circumstances.  Accordingly, she hadgiven all her estate to charitable uses, reserving only twelvepounds a year to live on, and out of this sum she still gave a greatdeal in charity, living herself on water-gruel only, and usingno fire but to boil it.  She had lived many years in that garret,being permitted to remain there gratis by successive Catholic tenantsof the house below, as they deemed it a blessing to have her there.A priest visited her to confess her every day.  'I have ask'd her,'says my landlady, 'how she, as she liv'd, could possibly find so muchemployment for a confessor?'  'Oh,' said she, 'it is impossibleto avoid vain thoughts.'  I was permitted once to visit her, She waschearful and polite, and convers'd pleasantly.  The room was clean,but had no other furniture than a matras, a table with a crucifixand book, a stool which she gave me to sit on, and a pictureover the chimney of Saint Veronica displaying her handkerchief,with the miraculous figure of Christ's bleeding face on it,which she explained to me with great seriousness.  She look'd pale,but was never sick; and I give it as another instance on how smallan income life and health may be supported.At Watts's printing-house I contracted an acquaintance with an ingeniousyoung man, one Wygate, who, having wealthy relations, had been bettereducated than most printers; was a tolerable Latinist, spoke French,and lov'd reading.  I taught him and a friend of his to swim attwice going into the river, and they soon became good swimmers.They introduc'd me to some gentlemen from the country, who went toChelsea by water to see the College and Don Saltero's curiosities.In our return, at the request of the company, whose curiosityWygate had excited, I stripped and leaped into the river, and swamfrom near Chelsea to Blackfryar's, performing on the way many featsof activity, both upon and under water, that surpris'd and pleas'dthose to whom they were novelties.I had from a child been ever delighted with this exercise, had studiedand practis'd all Thevenot's motions and positions, added someof my own, aiming at the graceful and easy as well as the useful.All these I took this occasion of exhibiting to the company,and was much flatter'd by their admiration; and Wygate, who wasdesirous of becoming a master, grew more and more attach'd to meon that account, as well as from the similarity of our studies.He at length proposed to me travelling all over Europe together,supporting ourselves everywhere by working at our business.  I wasonce inclined to it; but, mentioning it to my good friend Mr. Denham,with whom I often spent an hour when I had leisure, he dissuaded mefrom it, advising me to think only of returning to Pennsilvania,which he was now about to do.I must record one trait of this good man's character.  He had formerlybeen in business at Bristol, but failed in debt to a number of people,compounded and went to America.  There, by a close application tobusiness as a merchant, he acquir'd a plentiful fortune in a few years.Returning to England in the ship with me, he invited his old creditorsto an entertainment, at which he thank'd them for the easy compositionthey had favored him with, and, when they expected nothing but the treat,every man at the first remove found under his plate an orderon a banker for the full amount of the unpaid remainder with interest.He now told me he was about to return to Philadelphia, and shouldcarry over a great quantity of goods in order to open a store there.He propos'd to take me over as his clerk, to keep his books,in which he would instruct me, copy his letters, and attendthe store.  He added that, as soon as I should be acquaintedwith mercantile business, he would promote me by sending me witha cargo of flour and bread, etc., to the West Indies, and procureme commissions from others which would be profitable; and, if Imanag'd well, would establish me handsomely.  The thing pleas'd me;for I was grown tired of London, remembered with pleasure the happymonths I had spent in Pennsylvania, and wish'd again to see it;therefore I immediately agreed on the terms of fifty pounds a year,Pennsylvania money; less, indeed, than my present gettings asa compositor, but affording a better prospect.I now took leave of printing, as I thought, for ever, and was dailyemployed in my new business, going about with Mr. Denham amongthe tradesmen to purchase various articles, and seeing them pack'd up,doing errands, calling upon workmen to dispatch, etc.; and, when allwas on board, I had a few days' leisure.  On one of these days,I was, to my surprise, sent for by a great man I knew only by name,a Sir William Wyndham, and I waited upon him.  He had heard by somemeans or other of my swimming from Chelsea to Blackfriar's, and ofmy teaching Wygate and another young man to swim in a few hours.He had two sons, about to set out on their travels; he wish'd to havethem first taught swimming, and proposed to gratify me handsomelyif I would teach them.  They were not yet come to town, and my staywas uncertain, so I could not undertake it; but, from this incident,I thought it likely that, if I were to remain in England and opena swimming-school, I might get a good deal of money; and it struck meso strongly, that, had the overture been sooner made me, probably Ishould not so soon have returned to America.  After many years,you and I had something of more importance to do with one of thesesons of Sir William Wyndham, become Earl of Egremont, which I shallmention in its place.Thus I spent about eighteen months in London; most part of the timeI work'd hard at my business, and spent but little upon myselfexcept in seeing plays and in books.  My friend Ralph had keptme poor; he owed me about twenty-seven pounds, which I was nownever likely to receive; a great sum out of my small earnings!I lov'd him, notwithstanding, for he had many amiable qualities.I had by no means improv'd my fortune; but I had picked up some veryingenious acquaintance, whose conversation was of great advantage to me;and I had read considerably.We sail'd from Gravesend on the 23d of July, 1726.  For the incidentsof the voyage, I refer you to my journal, where you will find themall minutely related.  Perhaps the most important part of thatjournal is the plan<5> to be found in it, which I formed at sea,for regulating my future conduct in life.  It is the more remarkable,as being formed when I was so young, and yet being pretty faithfullyadhered to quite thro' to old age.     <5> The 'Journal' was printed by Sparks, from a copy made         at Reading in 1787.  But it does not contain the Plan.         --Ed.We landed in Philadelphia on the 11th of October, where I foundsundry alterations.  Keith was no longer governor, being supersededby Major Gordon.  I met him walking the streets as a common citizen.He seem'd a little asham'd at seeing me, but pass'd withoutsaying anything.  I should have been as much asham'd at seeingMiss Read, had not her friends, despairing with reason of my returnafter the receipt of my letter, persuaded her to marry another,one Rogers, a potter, which was done in my absence.  With him,however, she was never happy, and soon parted from him, refusing tocohabit with him or bear his name, it being now said that he badanother wife.  He was a worthless fellow, tho' an excellent workman,which was the temptation to her friends.  He got into debt,ran away in 1727 or 1728, went to the West Indies, and died there.Keimer had got a better house, a shop well supply'd with stationery,plenty of new types, a number of hands, tho' none good, and seem'dto have a great deal of business.Mr. Denham took a store in Water-street, where we open'd our goods;I attended the business diligently, studied accounts, and grew,in a little time, expert at selling.  We lodg'd and, boarded together;he counsell'd me as a father, having a sincere regard for me.I respected and lov'd him, and we might have gone on togethervery happy; but, in the beginning of February, 1726-7, when Ihad just pass'd my twenty-first year, we both were taken ill.My distemper was a pleurisy, which very nearly carried me off.I suffered a good deal, gave up the point in my own mind, and wasrather disappointed when I found myself recovering, regretting,in some degree, that I must now, some time or other, have all thatdisagreeable work to do over again.  I forget what his distemper was;it held him a long time, and at length carried him off.  He left mea small legacy in a nuncupative will, as a token of his kindnessfor me, and he left me once more to the wide world; for the storewas taken into the care of his executors, and my employment underhim ended.My brother-in-law, Holmes, being now at Philadelphia, advised my returnto my business; and Keimer tempted me, with an offer of large wagesby the year, to come and take the management of his printing-house,that he might better attend his stationer's shop.  I had heard a badcharacter of him in London from his wife and her friends, and wasnot fond of having any more to do with him.  I tri'd for fartheremployment as a merchant's clerk; but, not readily meeting with any,I clos'd again with Keimer.  I found in his house these hands:Hugh Meredith, a Welsh Pensilvanian, thirty years of age, bred tocountry work; honest, sensible, had a great deal of solid observation,was something of a reader, but given to drink.  Stephen Potts, a youngcountryman of full age, bred to the same, of uncommon natural parts,and great wit and humor, but a little idle.  These he had agreedwith at extream low wages per week, to be rais'd a shilling everythree months, as they would deserve by improving in their business;and the expectation of these high wages, to come on hereafter,was what he had drawn them in with.  Meredith was to work at press,Potts at book-binding, which he, by agreement, was to teach them,though he knew neither one nor t'other. John ----, a wild Irishman,brought up to no business, whose service, for four years, Keimer hadpurchased from the captain of a ship; he, too, was to be madea pressman.  George Webb, an Oxford scholar, whose time for fouryears he had likewise bought, intending him for a compositor,of whom more presently; and David Harry, a country boy, whom he hadtaken apprentice.I soon perceiv'd that the intention of engaging me at wages so muchhigher than he had been us'd to give, was, to have these raw,cheap hands form'd thro' me; and, as soon as I had instructed them,then they being all articled to him, he should be able to do without me.I went on, however, very cheerfully, put his printing-house in order,which had been in great confusion, and brought his hands by degreesto mind their business and to do it better.It was an odd thing to find an Oxford scholar in the situationof a bought servant.  He was not more than eighteen years of age,and gave me this account of himself; that he was born in Gloucester,educated at a grammar-school there, had been distinguish'd amongthe scholars for some apparent superiority in performing his part,when they exhibited plays; belong'd to the Witty Club there,and had written some pieces in prose and verse, which were printedin the Gloucester newspapers; thence he was sent to Oxford; where hecontinued about a year, but not well satisfi'd, wishing of allthings to see London, and become a player.  At length, receiving hisquarterly allowance of fifteen guineas, instead of discharginghis debts he walk'd out of town, hid his gown in a furze bush,and footed it to London, where, having no friend to advise him, he fellinto bad company, soon spent his guineas, found no means of beingintroduc'd among the players, grew necessitous, pawn'd his cloaths,and wanted bread.  Walking the street very hungry, and not knowingwhat to do with himself, a crimp's bill was put into his hand,offering immediate entertainment and encouragement to such as wouldbind themselves to serve in America.He went directly, sign'd the indentures, was put into the ship,and came over, never writing a line to acquaint his friends what wasbecome of him.  He was lively, witty, good-natur'd, and a pleasantcompanion, but idle, thoughtless, and imprudent to the last degree.John, the Irishman, soon ran away; with the rest I began to livevery agreeably, for they all respected me the more, as theyfound Keimer incapable of instructing them, and that from methey learned something daily.  We never worked on Saturday,that being Keimer's Sabbath, so I had two days for reading.My acquaintance with ingenious people in the town increased.Keimer himself treated me with great civility and apparent regard,and nothing now made me uneasy but my debt to Vernon, which Iwas yet unable to pay, being hitherto but a poor oeconomist.He, however, kindly made no demand of it.Our printing-house often wanted sorts, and there was no letter-founderin America; I had seen types cast at James's in London, but withoutmuch attention to the manner; however, I now contrived a mould,made use of the letters we had as puncheons, struck the matricesin lead, And thus supply'd in a pretty tolerable way all deficiencies.I also engrav'd several things on occasion; I made the ink;I was warehouseman, and everything, and, in short, quite a factotum.But, however serviceable I might be, I found that my servicesbecame every day of less importance, as the other hands improv'din the business; and, when Keimer paid my second quarter's wages,he let me know that he felt them too heavy, and thought I shouldmake an abatement.  He grew by degrees less civil, put on more ofthe master, frequently found fault, was captious, and seem'd ready foran outbreaking.  I went on, nevertheless, with a good deal of patience,thinking that his encumber'd circumstances were partly the cause.At length a trifle snapt our connections; for, a great noise happeningnear the court-house, I put my head out of the window to see whatwas the matter.  Keimer, being in the street, look'd up and saw me,call'd out to me in a loud voice and angry tone to mind my business,adding some reproachful words, that nettled me the more fortheir publicity, all the neighbors who were looking out on the sameoccasion being witnesses how I was treated.  He came up immediatelyinto the printing-house, continu'd the quarrel, high words pass'don both sides, he gave me the quarter's warning we had stipulated,expressing a wish that he had not been oblig'd to so long a warning.I told him his wish was unnecessary, for I would leave him that instant;and so, taking my hat, walk'd out of doors, desiring Meredith,whom I saw below, to take care of some things I left, and bringthem to my lodgings.Meredith came accordingly in the evening, when we talked my affair over.He had conceiv'd a great regard for me, and was very unwillingthat I should leave the house while he remain'd in it.  He dissuadedme from returning to my native country, which I began to think of;he reminded me that Keimer was in debt for all he possess'd;that his creditors began to be uneasy; that he kept his shop miserably,sold often without profit for ready money, and often trusted withoutkeeping accounts; that he must therefore fall, which would makea vacancy I might profit of.  I objected my want of money.  He thenlet me know that his father had a high opinion of me, and, from somediscourse that had pass'd between them, he was sure would advancemoney to set us up, if I would enter into partnership with him.'My time,' says he, 'will be out with Keimer in the spring;by that time we may have our press and types in from London.I am sensible I am no workman; if you like it, your skill in thebusiness shall be set against the stock I furnish, and we will sharethe profits equally.'The proposal was agreeable, and I consented; his father was in townand approv'd of it; the more as he saw I had great influence withhis son, had prevail'd on him to abstain long from dram-drinking,and he hop'd might break him off that wretched habit entirely,when we came to be so closely connected.  I gave an inventory tothe father, who carry'd it to a merchant; the things were sent for,the secret was to be kept till they should arrive, and in the meantime I was to get work, if I could, at the other printing-house. But Ifound no vacancy there, and so remain'd idle a few days, when Keimer,on a prospect of being employ'd to print some paper money in New Jersey,which would require cuts and various types that I only could supply,and apprehending Bradford might engage me and get the jobb from him,sent me a very civil message, that old friends should not part for afew words, the effect of sudden passion, and wishing me to return.Meredith persuaded me to comply, as it would give more opportunityfor his improvement under my daily instructions; so I return'd,and we went on more smoothly than for some time before.  The Newjersey jobb was obtain'd, I contriv'd a copperplate press for it,the first that had been seen in the country; I cut several ornamentsand checks for the bills.  We went together to Burlington, where Iexecuted the whole to satisfaction; and he received so large a sumfor the work as to be enabled thereby to keep his head much longerabove water.At Burlington I made an acquaintance with many principal peopleof the province.  Several of them had been appointed by the Assemblya committee to attend the press, and take care that no more billswere printed than the law directed.  They were therefore, by turns,constantly with us, and generally he who attended, brought with hima friend or two for company.  My mind having been much more improv'dby reading than Keimer's, I suppose it was for that reason myconversation seem'd to be more valu'd. They had me to their houses,introduced me to their friends, and show'd me much civility;while he, tho' the master, was a little neglected.  In truth,he was an odd fish; ignorant of common life, fond of rudely opposingreceiv'd opinions, slovenly to extream dirtiness, enthusiastic insome points of religion, and a little knavish withal.We continu'd there near three months; and by that time I couldreckon among my acquired friends, Judge Allen, Samuel Bustill,the secretary of the Province, Isaac Pearson, Joseph Cooper,and several of the Smiths, members of Assembly, and Isaac Decow,the surveyor-general. The latter was a shrewd, sagacious old man,who told me that he began for himself, when young, by wheelingclay for the brick-makers, learned to write after he was of age,carri'd the chain for surveyors, who taught him surveying, and hehad now by his industry, acquir'd a good estate; and says he,'I foresee that you will soon work this man out of business,and make a fortune in it at Philadelphia.'  He had not thenthe least intimation of my intention to set up there or anywhere.These friends were afterwards of great use to me, as I occasionallywas to some of them.  They all continued their regard for me as long asthey lived.Before I enter upon my public appearance in business, it may be wellto let you know the then state of my mind with regard to my principlesand morals, that you may see how far those influenc'd the future eventsof my life.  My parents had early given me religious impressions,and brought me through my childhood piously in the Dissenting way.But I was scarce fifteen, when, after doubting by turns of severalpoints, as I found them disputed in the different books I read,I began to doubt of Revelation itself.  Some books against Deismfell into my hands; they were said to be the substance of sermonspreached at Boyle's Lectures.  It happened that they wroughtan effect on me quite contrary to what was intended by them;for the arguments of the Deists, which were quoted to be refuted,appeared to me much stronger than the refutations; in short,I soon became a thorough Deist.  My arguments perverted some others,particularly Collins and Ralph; but, each of them having afterwardswrong'd me greatly without the least compunction, and recollectingKeith's conduct towards me (who was another freethinker), and my owntowards Vernon and Miss Read, which at times gave me great trouble,I began to suspect that this doctrine, tho' it might be true,was not very useful.  My London pamphlet, which had for its mottothese lines of Dryden:          'Whatever is, is right.  Though purblind man          Sees but a part o' the chain, the nearest link:          His eyes not carrying to the equal beam,          That poises all above;'and from the attributes of God, his infinite wisdom, goodness and power,concluded that nothing could possibly be wrong in the world, and thatvice and virtue were empty distinctions, no such things existing,appear'd now not so clever a performance as I once thought it;and I doubted whether some error had not insinuated itself unperceiv'dinto my argument, so as to infect all that follow'd, as is commonin metaphysical reasonings.I grew convinc'd that truth, sincerity and integrity in dealingsbetween man and man were of the utmost importance to the felicityof life; and I form'd written resolutions, which still remainin my journal book, to practice them ever while I lived.Revelation had indeed no weight with me, as such; but I entertain'dan opinion that, though certain actions might not be bad because theywere forbidden by it, or good because it commanded them, yet probablythese actions might be forbidden because they were bad for us,or commanded because they were beneficial to us, in their own natures,all the circumstances of things considered.  And this persuasion,with the kind hand of Providence, or some guardian angel, or accidentalfavorable circumstances and situations, or all together, preserved me,thro' this dangerous time of youth, and the hazardous situations Iwas sometimes in among strangers, remote from the eye and adviceof my father, without any willful gross immorality or injustice,that might have been expected from my want of religion.  I say willful,because the instances I have mentioned had something of necessityin them, from my youth, inexperience, and the knavery of others.I had therefore a tolerable character to begin the world with;I valued it properly, and determin'd to preserve it.We had not been long return'd to Philadelphia before the new typesarriv'd from London.  We settled with Keimer, and left him by his consentbefore he heard of it.  We found a house to hire near the market,and took it.  To lessen the rent, which was then but twenty-fourpounds a year, tho' I have since known it to let for seventy,we took in Thomas Godfrey, a glazier, and his family, who were topay a considerable part of it to us, and we to board with them.We had scarce opened our letters and put our press in order,before George House, an acquaintance of mine, brought a countrymanto us, whom he had met in the street inquiring for a printer.All our cash was now expended in the variety of particulars wehad been obliged to procure, and this countryman's five shillings,being our first-fruits, and coming so seasonably, gave me more pleasurethan any crown I have since earned; and the gratitude I felt towardHouse has made me often more ready than perhaps I should otherwisehave been to assist young beginners.There are croakers in every country, always boding its ruin.Such a one then lived in Philadelphia; a person of note, an elderly man,with a wise look and a very grave manner of speaking; his namewas Samuel Mickle.  This gentleman, a stranger to me, stopt one dayat my door, and asked me if I was the young man who had latelyopened a new printing-house. Being answered in the affirmative,he said he was sorry for me, because it was an expensive undertaking,and the expense would be lost; for Philadelphia was a sinking place,the people already half-bankrupts, or near being so; all appearancesto the contrary, such as new buildings and the rise of rents,being to his certain knowledge fallacious; for they were, in fact,among the things that would soon ruin us.  And he gave me sucha detail of misfortunes now existing, or that were soon to exist,that he left me half melancholy.  Had I known him before Iengaged in this business, probably I never should have done it.This man continued to live in this decaying place, and to declaimin the same strain, refusing for many years to buy a house there,because all was going to destruction; and at last I had the pleasureof seeing him give five times as much for one as he might have boughtit for when he first began his croaking.I should have mentioned before, that, in the autumn of the preceding year,I had form'd most of my ingenious acquaintance into a club of mutualimprovement, which we called the JUNTO; we met on Friday evenings.The rules that I drew up required that every member, in his turn,should produce one or more queries on any point of Morals, Politics,or Natural Philosophy, to be discuss'd by the company; and oncein three months produce and read an essay of his own writing,on any subject he pleased.  Our debates were to be under the directionof a president, and to be conducted in the sincere spirit of inquiryafter truth, without fondness for dispute, or desire of victory;and, to prevent warmth, all expressions of positiveness in opinions,or direct contradiction, were after some time made contraband,and prohibited under small pecuniary penalties.The first members were Joseph Breintnal, a copyer of deeds forthe scriveners, a good-natur'd, friendly, middle-ag'd man, a greatlover of poetry, reading all he could meet with, and writing somethat was tolerable; very ingenious in many little Nicknackeries,and of sensible conversation.Thomas Godfrey, a self-taught mathematician, great in his way,and afterward inventor of what is now called Hadley's Quadrant.But he knew little out of his way, and was not a pleasing companion;as, like most great mathematicians I have met with, he expecteduniversal precision in everything said, or was for ever denying ordistinguishing upon trifles, to the disturbance of all conversation.He soon left us.Nicholas Scull, a surveyor, afterwards surveyor-general,who lov'd books, and sometimes made a few verses.William Parsons, bred a shoemaker, but loving reading, had acquir'da considerable share of mathematics, which he first studiedwith a view to astrology, that he afterwards laught at it.He also became surveyor-general.William Maugridge, a joiner, a most exquisite mechanic, and a solid,sensible man.Hugh Meredith, Stephen Potts, and George Webb I have characteriz'd before.Robert Grace, a young gentleman of some fortune, generous, lively,and witty; a lover of punning and of his friends.And William Coleman, then a merchant's clerk, about my age, who hadthe coolest, dearest head, the best heart, and the exactest moralsof almost any man I ever met with.  He became afterwards a merchantof great note, and one of our provincial judges.  Our friendshipcontinued without interruption to his death, upward of forty years;and the club continued almost as long, and was the best schoolof philosophy, morality, and politics that then existed in the province;for our queries, which were read the week preceding their discussion,put us upon reading with attention upon the several subjects,that we might speak more to the purpose; and here, too, we acquiredbetter habits of conversation, every thing being studied in ourrules which might prevent our disgusting each other.  From hencethe long continuance of the club, which I shall have frequentoccasion to speak further of hereafter.But my giving this account of it here is to show something of the interestI had, every one of these exerting themselves in recommending businessto us.  Breintnal particularly procur'd us from the Quakers the printingforty sheets of their history, the rest being to be done by Keimer;and upon this we work'd exceedingly hard, for the price was low.It was a folio, pro patria size, in pica, with long primer notes.I compos'd of it a sheet a day, and Meredith worked it off at press;it was often eleven at night, and sometimes later, before I hadfinished my distribution for the next day's work, for the littlejobbs sent in by our other friends now and then put us back.But so determin'd I was to continue doing a sheet a day of the folio,that one night, when, having impos'd my forms, I thought my day'swork over, one of them by accident was broken, and two pagesreduced to pi, I immediately distributed and compos'd it over againbefore I went to bed; and this industry, visible to our neighbors,began to give us character and credit; particularly, I was told,that mention being made of the new printing-office at the merchants'Every-night club, the general opinion was that it must fail,there being already two printers in the place, Keimer and Bradford;but Dr. Baird (whom you and I saw many years after at his native place,St. Andrew's in Scotland) gave a contrary opinion:  'For the industryof that 
ENTP	,' says he, 'is superior to any thing I ever sawof the kind; I see him still at work when I go home from club,and he is at work again before his neighbors are out of bed.'This struck the rest, and we soon after had offers from one of themto supply us with stationery; but as yet we did not chuse to engage inshop business.I mention this industry the more particularly and the more freely,tho' it seems to be talking in my own praise, that those ofmy posterity, who shall read it, may know the use of that virtue,when they see its effects in my favour throughout this relation.George Webb, who had found a female friend that lent him wherewithto purchase his time of Keimer, now came to offer himself as ajourneyman to us.  We could not then employ him; but I foolishlylet him know as a secret that I soon intended to begin a newspaper,and might then have work for him.  My hopes of success, as I told him,were founded on this, that the then only newspaper, printed by Bradford,was a paltry thing, wretchedly manag'd, no way entertaining, and yetwas profitable to him; I therefore thought a good paper would scarcelyfail of good encouragement.  I requested Webb not to mention it;but he told it to Keimer, who immediately, to be beforehand with me,published proposals for printing one himself, on which Webbwas to be employ'd. I resented this; and, to counteract them,as I could not yet begin our paper, I wrote several pieces ofentertainment for Bradford's paper, under the title of the BUSY BODY,which Breintnal continu'd some months.  By this means the attentionof the publick was fixed on that paper, and Keimer's proposals,which we burlesqu'd and ridicul'd, were disregarded.  He beganhis paper, however, and, after carrying it on three quarters ofa year, with at most only ninety subscribers, he offered it to mefor a trifle; and I, having been ready some time to go on with it,took it in hand directly; and it prov'd in a few years extremelyprofitable to me.I perceive that I am apt to speak in the singular number,though our partnership still continu'd; the reason may be that,in fact, the whole management of the business lay upon me.Meredith was no compositor, a poor pressman, and seldom sober.My friends lamented my connection with him, but I was to make the bestof it.Our first papers made a quite different appearance from any beforein the province; a better type, and better printed; but some spiritedremarks of my writing, on the dispute then going on between GovernorBurnet and the Massachusetts Assembly, struck the principal people,occasioned the paper and the manager of it to be much talk'd of,and in a few weeks brought them all to be our subscribers.Their example was follow'd by many, and our number went ongrowing continually.  This was one of the first good effects of myhaving learnt a little to scribble; another was, that the leading men,seeing a newspaper now in the hands of one who could also handlea pen, thought it convenient to oblige and encourage me.Bradford still printed the votes, and laws, and other publick business.He had printed an address of the House to the governor, in a coarse,blundering manner, we reprinted it elegantly and correctly,and sent one to every member.  They were sensible of the difference:it strengthened the hands of our friends in the House, and theyvoted us their printers for the year ensuing.Among my friends in the House I must not forget Mr. Hamilton,before mentioned, who was then returned from England, and had a seatin it.  He interested himself for me strongly in that instance,as he did in many others afterward, continuing his patronage tillhis death.<6>     <6> I got his son once L500.--[Marg. note.]Mr. Vernon, about this time, put me in mind of the debt I ow'd him,but did not press me.  I wrote him an ingenuous letter of acknowledgment,crav'd his forbearance a little longer, which he allow'd me,and as soon as I was able, I paid the principal with interest,and many thanks; so that erratum was in some degree corrected.But now another difficulty came upon me which I had never the leastreason to expect.  Mr. Meredith's father, who was to have paid forour printing-house, according to the expectations given me, was ableto advance only one hundred pounds currency, which had been paid;and a hundred more was due to the merchant, who grew impatient,and su'd us all.  We gave bail, but saw that, if the money couldnot be rais'd in time, the suit must soon come to a judgmentand execution, and our hopeful prospects must, with us, be ruined,as the press and letters must be sold for payment, perhaps athalf price.In this distress two true friends, whose kindness I have never forgotten,nor ever shall forget while I can remember any thing, came tome separately, unknown to each other, and, without any applicationfrom me, offering each of them to advance me all the money that shouldbe necessary to enable me to take the whole business upon myself,if that should be practicable; but they did not like my continuingthe partnership with Meredith, who, as they said, was often seendrunk in the streets, and playing at low games in alehouses, much toour discredit.  These two friends were William Coleman and Robert Grace.I told them I could not propose a separation while any prospectremain'd of the Merediths' fulfilling their part of our agreement,because I thought myself under great obligations to them for what theyhad done, and would do if they could; but, if they finally fail'din their performance, and our partnership must be dissolv'd, I shouldthen think myself at liberty to accept the assistance of my friends.Thus the matter rested for some time, when I said to my partner,'Perhaps your father is dissatisfied at the part you have undertakenin this affair of ours, and is unwilling to advance for you andme what he would for you alone.  If that is the case, tell me,and I will resign the whole to you, and go about my business.''No,' said he, 'my father has really been disappointed, and isreally unable; and I am unwilling to distress him farther.I see this is a business I am not fit for.  I was bred a farmer,and it was a folly in me to come to town, and put myself, at thirtyyears of age, an apprentice to learn a new trade.  Many of our Welshpeople are going to settle in North Carolina, where land is cheap.I am inclin'd to go with them, and follow my old employment.You may find friends to assist you.  If you will take the debtsof the company upon you; return to my father the hundred pound hehas advanced; pay my little personal debts, and give me thirtypounds and a new saddle, I will relinquish the partnership,and leave the whole in your hands.'  I agreed to this proposal:it was drawn up in writing, sign'd, and seal'd immediately.I gave him what he demanded, and he went soon after to Carolina,from whence he sent me next year two long letters, containing thebest account that had been given of that country, the climate,the soil, husbandry, etc., for in those matters he was very judicious.I printed them in the papers, and they gave great satisfaction tothe publick.As soon as he was gone, I recurr'd to my two friends; and because Iwould not give an unkind preference to either, I took half ofwhat each had offered and I wanted of one, and half of the other;paid off the company's debts, and went on with the businessin my own name, advertising that the partnership was dissolved.I think this was in or about the year 1729.About this time there was a cry among the people for more paper money,only fifteen thousand pounds being extant in the province, and that soonto be sunk.  The wealthy inhabitants oppos'd any addition, being againstall paper currency, from an apprehension that it would depreciate,as it had done in New England, to the prejudice of all creditors.We had discuss'd this point in our Junto, where I was on the sideof an addition, being persuaded that the first small sum struck in 1723had done much good by increasing the trade, employment, and numberof inhabitants in the province, since I now saw all the old housesinhabited, and many new ones building; whereas I remembered well,that when I first walk'd about the streets of Philadelphia,eating my roll, I saw most of the houses in Walnut-street, betweenSecond and Front streets, with bills on their doors, 'To be let';and many likewise in Chestnut-street and other streets, which made me thenthink the inhabitants of the city were deserting it one after another.Our debates possess'd me so fully of the subject, that I wroteand printed an anonymous pamphlet on it, entitled 'The Nature andNecessity of a Paper Currency.'  It was well receiv'd by the commonpeople in general; but the rich men dislik'd it, for it increas'dand strengthen'd the clamor for more money, and they happening to haveno writers among them that were able to answer it, their oppositionslacken'd, and the point was carried by a majority in the House.My friends there, who conceiv'd I had been of some service,thought fit to reward me by employing me in printing the money;a very profitable jobb and a great help to me.  This was anotheradvantage gain'd by my being able to write.The utility of this currency became by time and experience so evident asnever afterwards to be much disputed; so that it grew soon to fifty-fivethousand pounds, and in 1739 to eighty thousand pounds, since which itarose during war to upwards of three hundred and fifty thousand pounds,trade, building, and inhabitants all the while increasing, tillI now think there are limits beyond which the quantity may be hurtful.I soon after obtain'd, thro' my friend Hamilton, the printing of theNewcastle paper money, another profitable jobb as I then thought it;small things appearing great to those in small circumstances;and these, to me, were really great advantages, as they weregreat encouragements.  He procured for me, also, the printingof the laws and votes of that government, which continu'din my hands as long as I follow'd the business.I now open'd a little stationer's shop.  I had in it blanks ofall sorts, the correctest that ever appear'd among us, being assistedin that by my friend Breintnal.  I had also paper, parchment,chapmen's books, etc.  One Whitemash, a compositor I had known in London,an excellent workman, now came to me, and work'd with me constantlyand diligently; and I took an apprentice, the son of Aquila Rose.I began now gradually to pay off the debt I was under for theprinting-house. In order to secure my credit and character as a tradesman,I took care not only to be in reality industrious and frugal,but to avoid all appearances to the contrary.  I drest plainly;I was seen at no places of idle diversion.  I never went out a fishingor shooting; a book, indeed, sometimes debauch'd me from my work,but that was seldom, snug, and gave no scandal; and, to show that Iwas not above my business, I sometimes brought home the paperI purchas'd at the stores thro' the streets on a wheelbarrow.Thus being esteem'd an industrious, thriving young man, and payingduly for what I bought, the merchants who imported stationerysolicited my custom; others proposed supplying me with books,and I went on swimmingly.  In the mean time, Keimer's creditand business declining daily, he was at last forc'd to sell hisprinting house to satisfy his creditors.  He went to Barbadoes,and there lived some years in very poor circumstances.His apprentice, David Harry, whom I had instructed while I work'dwith him, set up in his place at Philadelphia, having boughthis materials.  I was at first apprehensive of a powerful rivalin Harry, as his friends were very able, and had a good dealof interest.  I therefore propos'd a partner-ship to him which he,fortunately for me, rejected with scorn.  He was very proud,dress'd like a gentleman, liv'd expensively, took much diversionand pleasure abroad, ran in debt, and neglected his business;upon which, all business left him; and, finding nothing to do,he followed Keimer to Barbadoes, taking the printing-house with him.There this apprentice employ'd his former master as a journeyman;they quarrel'd often; Harry went continually behindhand, and atlength was forc'd to sell his types and return to his country workin Pensilvania.  The person that bought them employ'd Keimer to use them,but in a few years he died.There remained now no competitor with me at Philadelphia but theold one, Bradford; who was rich and easy, did a little printingnow and then by straggling hands, but was not very anxiousabout the business.  However, as he kept the post-office, it wasimagined he had better opportunities of obtaining news; his paperwas thought a better distributer of advertisements than mine,and therefore had many, more, which was a profitable thing to him,and a disadvantage to me; for, tho' I did indeed receive and sendpapers by the post, yet the publick opinion was otherwise, for whatI did send was by bribing the riders, who took them privately,Bradford being unkind enough to forbid it, which occasion'd someresentment on my part; and I thought so meanly of him for it, that,when I afterward came into his situation, I took care never to imitate it.I had hitherto continu'd to board with Godfrey, who lived in partof my house with his wife and children, and had one side of the shopfor his glazier's business, tho' he worked little, being alwaysabsorbed in his mathematics.  Mrs. Godfrey projected a match for mewith a relation's daughter, took opportunities of bringing us oftentogether, till a serious courtship on my part ensu'd, the girl beingin herself very deserving.  The old folks encourag'd me by continualinvitations to supper, and by leaving us together, till at lengthit was time to explain.  Mrs. Godfrey manag'd our little treaty.I let her know that I expected as much money with their daughteras would pay off my remaining debt for the printing-house, which Ibelieve was not then above a hundred pounds.  She brought me wordthey had no such sum to spare; I said they might mortgage theirhouse in the loan-office. The answer to this, after some days, was,that they did not approve the match; that, on inquiry of Bradford,they had been inform'd the printing business was not a profitable one;the types would soon be worn out, and more wanted; that S. Keimerand D. Harry had failed one after the other, and I should probablysoon follow them; and, therefore, I was forbidden the house,and the daughter shut up.Whether this was a real change of sentiment or only artifice,on a supposition of our being too far engaged in affection to retract,and therefore that we should steal a marriage, which would leavethem at liberty to give or withhold what they pleas'd, I know not;but I suspected the latter, resented it, and went no more.Mrs. Godfrey brought me afterward some more favorable accounts oftheir disposition, and would have drawn me on again; but I declaredabsolutely my resolution to have nothing more to do with that family.This was resented by the Godfreys; we differ'd, and they removed,leaving me the whole house, and I resolved to take no more inmates.But this affair having turned my thoughts to marriage, I look'dround me and made overtures of acquaintance in other places;but soon found that, the business of a printer being generallythought a poor one, I was not to expect money with a wife,unless with such a one as I should not otherwise think agreeable.In the mean time, that hard-to-be-governed passion of youth hurriedme frequently into intrigues with low women that fell in my way,which were attended with some expense and great inconvenience,besides a continual risque to my health by a distemper which ofall things I dreaded, though by great good luck I escaped it.A friendly correspondence as neighbors and old acquaintanceshad continued between me and Mrs. Read's family, who all had aregard for me from the time of my first lodging in their house.I was often invited there and consulted in their affairs,wherein I sometimes was of service.  I piti'd poor Miss Read'sunfortunate situation, who was generally dejected, seldom cheerful,and avoided company.  I considered my giddiness and inconstancywhen in London as in a great degree the cause of her unhappiness,tho' the mother was good enough to think the fault more her ownthan mine, as she had prevented our marrying before I went thither,and persuaded the other match in my absence.  Our mutual affectionwas revived, but there were now great objections to our union.The match was indeed looked upon as invalid, a preceding wife beingsaid to be living in England; but this could not easily be prov'd,because of the distance; and, tho' there was a report of his death,it was not certain.  Then, tho' it should be true, he had leftmany debts, which his successor might be call'd upon to pay.We ventured, however, over all these difficulties, and I took herto wife, September 1st, 1730.  None of the inconveniences happenedthat we had apprehended, she proved a good and faithful helpmate,assisted me much by attending the shop; we throve together, and haveever mutually endeavored to make each other happy.  Thus I correctedthat great erratum as well as I could.About this time, our club meeting, not at a tavern, but in a littleroom of Mr. Grace's, set apart for that purpose, a propositionwas made by me, that, since our books were often referr'd to in ourdisquisitions upon the queries, it might be convenient to us to have themaltogether where we met, that upon occasion they might be consulted;and by thus clubbing our books to a common library, we should,while we lik'd to keep them together, have each of us the advantageof using the books of all the other members, which would be nearlyas beneficial as if each owned the whole.  It was lik'd and agreed to,and we fill'd one end of the room with such books as we couldbest spare.  The number was not so great as we expected; and tho'they had been of great use, yet some inconveniences occurringfor want of due care of them, the collection, after about a year,was separated, and each took his books home againAnd now I set on foot my first project of a public nature, that fora subscription library.  I drew up the proposals, got them put intoform by our great scrivener, Brockden, and, by the help of my friendsin the Junto, procured fifty subscribers of forty shillings eachto begin with, and ten shillings a year for fifty years, the termour company was to continue.  We afterwards obtain'd a charter,the company being increased to one hundred:  this was the motherof all the North American subscription libraries, now so numerous.It is become a great thing itself, and continually increasing.These libraries have improved the general conversation of the Americans,made the common tradesmen and farmers as intelligent as most gentlemenfrom other countries, and perhaps have contributed in some degreeto the stand so generally made throughout the colonies in defenseof their privileges.Memo.  Thus far was written with the intention express'd in the beginningand therefore contains several little family anecdotes of no importanceto others.  What follows was written many years after in compliancewith the advice contain'd in these letters, and accordingly intended forthe public.  The affairs of the Revolution occasion'd the interruption.     Letter from Mr. Abel James, with Notes of my Life                    (received in Paris).'MY DEAR AND HONORED FRIEND:  I have often been desirous ofwriting to thee, but could not be reconciled to the thought thatthe letter might fall into the hands of the British, lest someprinter or busy-body should publish some part of the contents,and give our friend pain, and myself censure.'Some time since there fell into my hands, to my great joy,about twenty-three sheets in thy own handwriting, containing anaccount of the parentage and life of thyself, directed to thy son,ending in the year 1730, with which there were notes, likewise inthy writing; a copy of which I inclose, in hopes it may be a means,if thou continued it up to a later period, that the first and latterpart may be put together; and if it is not yet continued, I hope theewill not delay it.

ENTP	 should leave his friends and the world deprived of so pleasingand profitable a work; a work which would be useful and entertainingnot only to a few, but to millions?  The influence writings underthat class have on the minds of youth is very great, and has nowhereappeared to me so plain, as in our public friend's journals.It almost insensibly leads the youth into the resolution of endeavoringto become as good and eminent as the journalist.  Should thine,for instance, when published (and I think it could not fail ofit), lead the youth to equal the industry and temperance of thyearly youth, what a blessing with that class would such a work be!I know of no character living, nor many of them put together,who has so much in his power as thyself to promote a greater spiritof industry and early attention to business, frugality, and temperancewith the American youth.  Not that I think the work would have noother merit and use in the world, far from it; but the first isof such vast importance that I know nothing that can equal it.'The foregoing letter and the minutes accompanying it being shownto a friend, I received from him the following:     Letter from Mr. Benjamin Vaughan.                                 'PARIS, January 31, 1783.'My DEAREST SIR:  When I had read over your sheets of minutesof the principal incidents of your life, recovered for you by yourQuaker acquaintance, I told you I would send you a letter expressingmy reasons why I thought it would be useful to complete and publishit as he desired.  Various concerns have for some time past preventedthis letter being written, and I do not know whether it was worthany expectation; happening to be at leisure, however, at present,I shall by writing, at least interest and instruct myself; but as theterms I am inclined to use may tend to offend a person of your manners,I shall only tell you how I would address any other person,who was as good and as great as yourself, but less diffident.I would say to him, Sir, I solicit the history of your lifefrom the following motives:  Your history is so remarkable,that if you do not give it, somebody else will certainly give it;and perhaps so as nearly to do as much harm, as your own managementof the thing might do good.  It will moreover present a tableof the internal circumstances of your country, which will verymuch tend to invite to it settlers of virtuous and manly minds.And considering the eagerness with which such information is soughtby them, and the extent of your reputation, I do not know of amore efficacious advertisement than your biography would give.All that has happened to you is also connected with the detailof the manners and situation of a rising people; and in thisrespect I do not think that the writings of Caesar and Tacitus canbe more interesting to a true judge of human nature and society.But these, sir, are small reasons, in my opinion, compared withthe chance which your life will give for the forming of futuregreat men; and in conjunction with your Art of Virtue (which youdesign to publish) of improving the features of private character,and consequently of aiding all happiness, both public and domestic.The two works I allude to, sir, will in particular give a noblerule and example of self-education. School and other educationconstantly proceed upon false principles, and show a clumsyapparatus pointed at a false mark; but your apparatus is simple,and the mark a true one; and while parents and young personsare left destitute of other just means of estimating and becomingprepared for a reasonable course in life, your discovery thatthe thing is in many a man's private power, will be invaluable!Influence upon the private character, late in life, is not onlyan influence late in life, but a weak influence.  It is in youththat we plant our chief habits and prejudices; it is in youththat we take our party as to profession, pursuits and matrimony.In youth, therefore, the turn is given; in youth the education evenof the next generation is given; in youth the private and publiccharacter is determined; and the term of life extending but from youthto age, life ought to begin well from youth, and more especiallybefore we take our party as to our principal objects.  But yourbiography will not merely teach self-education, but the educationof a wise man; and the wisest man will receive lights and improvehis progress, by seeing detailed the conduct of another wise man.And why are weaker men to be deprived of such helps, when we seeour race has been blundering on in the dark, almost without a guidein this particular, from the farthest trace of time?  Show then,sir, how much is to be done, both to sons and fathers; and inviteall wise men to become like yourself, and other men to become wise.When we see how cruel statesmen and warriors can be to the human race,and how absurd distinguished men can be to their acquaintance,it will be instructive to observe the instances multiply of pacific,acquiescing manners; and to find how compatible it is to be greatand domestic, enviable and yet good-humored.'The little private incidents which you will also have to relate,will have considerable use, as we want, above all things, rules ofprudence in ordinary affairs; and it will be curious to see how youhave acted in these.  It will be so far a sort of key to life,and explain many things that all men ought to have once explainedto them, to give, them a chance of becoming wise by foresight.The nearest thing to having experience of one's own, is to have otherpeople's affairs brought before us in a shape that is interesting;this is sure to happen from your pen; our affairs and management willhave an air of simplicity or importance that will not fail to strike;and I am convinced you have conducted them with as much originalityas if you had been conducting discussions in politics or philosophy;and what more worthy of experiments and system (its importance and itserrors considered) than human life?'Some men have been virtuous blindly, others have speculatedfantastically, and others have been shrewd to bad purposes;but you, sir, I am sure, will give under your hand, nothing butwhat is at the same moment, wise, practical and good, your accountof yourself (for I suppose the parallel I am drawing for Dr. 
ENTP	,will hold not only in point of character, but of private history)will show that you are ashamed of no origin; a thing the more important,as you prove how little necessary all origin is to happiness, virtue,or greatness.  As no end likewise happens without a means, so weshall find, sir, that even you yourself framed a plan by which youbecame considerable; but at the same time we may see that thoughthe event is flattering, the means are as simple as wisdom couldmake them; that is, depending upon nature, virtue, thought andhabit. Another thing demonstrated will be the propriety of everyman'swaiting for his time for appearing upon the stage of the world.Our sensations being very much fixed to the moment, we are apt toforget that more moments are to follow the first, and consequentlythat man should arrange his conduct so as to suit the whole of a life.Your attribution appears to have been applied to your life, and thepassing moments of it have been enlivened with content and enjoymentinstead of being tormented with foolish impatience or regrets.Such a conduct is easy for those who make virtue and themselvesin countenance by examples of other truly great men, of whompatience is so often the characteristic.  Your Quaker correspondent,sir (for here again I will suppose the subject of my letter resemblingDr. ), praised your frugality, diligence and temperance,which he considered as a pattern for all youth; but it is singularthat he should have forgotten your modesty and your disinterestedness,without which you never could have waited for your advancement,or found your situation in the mean time comfortable; which isa strong lesson to show the poverty of glory and the importanceof regulating our minds.  If this correspondent had known the natureof your reputation as well as I do, he would have said, Your formerwritings and measures would secure attention to your Biography,and Art of Virtue; and your Biography and Art of Virtue, in return,would secure attention to them.  This is an advantage attendant upona various character, and which brings all that belongs to it intogreater play; and it is the more useful, as perhaps more personsare at a loss for the means of improving their minds and characters,than they are for the time or the inclination to do it.  But thereis one concluding reflection, sir, that will shew the use of your lifeas a mere piece of biography.  This style of writing seems a littlegone out of vogue, and yet it is a very useful one; and your specimenof it may be particularly serviceable, as it will make a subject ofcomparison with the lives of various public cutthroats and intriguers,and with absurd monastic self-tormentors or vain literary triflers.If it encourages more writings of the same kind with your own,and induces more men to spend lives fit to be written, it will beworth all Plutarch's Lives put together.  But being tired of figuringto myself a character of which every feature suits only one man inthe world, without giving him the praise of it, I shall end my letter,my dear Dr. , with a personal application to your proper self.I am earnestly desirous, then, my dear sir, that you should let theworld into the traits of your genuine character, as civil broils nayotherwise tend to disguise or traduce it.  Considering your great age,the caution of your character, and your peculiar style of thinking,it is not likely that any one besides yourself can be sufficientlymaster of the facts of your life, or the intentions of your mind.Besides all this, the immense revolution of the present period,will necessarily turn our attention towards the author of it,and when virtuous principles have been pretended in it, it will behighly important to shew that such have really influenced; and, as yourown character will be the principal one to receive a scrutiny,it is proper (even for its effects upon your vast and rising country,as well as upon England and upon Europe) that it should standrespectable and eternal.  For the furtherance of human happiness,I have always maintained that it is necessary to prove thatman is not even at present a vicious and detestable animal;and still more to prove that good management may greatly amend him;and it is for much the same reason, that I am anxious to seethe opinion established, that there are fair characters existingamong the individuals of the race; for the moment that all men,without exception, shall be conceived abandoned, good people willcease efforts deemed to be hopeless, and perhaps think of takingtheir share in the scramble of life, or at least of making itcomfortable principally for themselves.  Take then, my dear sir,this work most speedily into hand:  shew yourself good as you are good;temperate as you are temperate; and above all things, prove yourselfas one, who from your infancy have loved justice, liberty and concord,in a way that has made it natural and consistent for you to have acted,as we have seen you act in the last seventeen years of your life.Let Englishmen be made not only to respect, but even to love you.When they think well of individuals in your native country,they will go nearer to thinking well of your country; and when yourcountrymen see themselves well thought of by Englishmen, they will gonearer to thinking well of England.  Extend your views even further;do not stop at those who speak the English tongue, but after havingsettled so many points in nature and politics, think of betteringthe whole race of men.  As I have not read any part of the lifein question, but know only the character that lived it, I writesomewhat at hazard.  I am sure, however, that the life and the treatiseI allude to (on the Art of Virtue) will necessarily fulfil the chiefof my expectations; and still more so if you take up the measureof suiting these performances to the several views above stated.Should they even prove unsuccessful in all that a sanguine admirerof yours hopes from them, you will at least have framed piecesto interest the human mind; and whoever gives a feeling of pleasurethat is innocent to man, has added so much to the fair side of a lifeotherwise too much darkened by anxiety and too much injured by pain.In the hope, therefore, that you will listen to the prayer addressedto you in this letter, I beg to subscribe myself, my dearest sir,etc., etc.,     'Signed, BENJ.  VAUGHAN.'Continuation of the Account of my Life, begun at Passy, near Paris, 1784.It is some time since I receiv'd the above letters, but I have beentoo busy till now to think of complying with the request they contain.It might, too, be much better done if I were at home among my papers,which would aid my memory, and help to ascertain dates; but myreturn being uncertain and having just now a little leisure, I willendeavor to recollect and write what I can; if I live to get home,it may there be corrected and improv'd.Not having any copy here of what is already written, I knownot whether an account is given of the means I used to establishthe Philadelphia public library, which, from a small beginning,is now become so considerable, though I remember to have comedown to near the time of that transaction (1730). I will thereforebegin here with an account of it, which may be struck out if foundto have been already given.At the time I establish'd myself in Pennsylvania, there was not a goodbookseller's shop in any of the colonies to the southward of Boston.In New York and Philad'a the printers were indeed stationers; they soldonly paper, etc., almanacs, ballads, and a few common school-books. Thosewho lov'd reading were oblig'd to send for their books from England;the members of the Junto had each a few.  We had left the alehouse,where we first met, and hired a room to hold our club in.I propos'd that we should all of us bring our books to that room,where they would not only be ready to consult in our conferences,but become a common benefit, each of us being at liberty to borrowsuch as he wish'd to read at home.  This was accordingly done,and for some time contented us.Finding the advantage of this little collection, I propos'd torender the benefit from books more common, by commencing a publicsubscription library.  I drew a sketch of the plan and rules that wouldbe necessary, and got a skilful conveyancer, Mr. Charles Brockden,to put the whole in form of articles of agreement to be subscribed,by which each subscriber engag'd to pay a certain sum down for the firstpurchase of books, and an annual contribution for increasing them.So few were the readers at that time in Philadelphia, and the majorityof us so poor, that I was not able, with great industry, to findmore than fifty persons, mostly young tradesmen, willing to pay downfor this purpose forty shillings each, and ten shillings per annum.On this little fund we began.  The books were imported; the librarywag opened one day in the week for lending to the subscribers,on their promissory notes to pay double the value if not duly returned.The institution soon manifested its utility, was imitated byother towns, and in other provinces.  The libraries were augmentedby donations; reading became fashionable; and our people,having no publick amusements to divert their attention from study,became better acquainted with books, and in a few years wereobserv'd by strangers to be better instructed and more intelligentthan people of the same rank generally are in other countries.When we were about to sign the above-mentioned articles, which wereto be binding upon us, our heirs, etc., for fifty years, Mr. Brockden,the scrivener, said to us, 'You are young men, but it is scarcelyprobable that any of you will live to see the expiration of the termfix'd in the instrument.'  A number of us, however, are yet living;but the instrument was after a few years rendered null by a charterthat incorporated and gave perpetuity to the company.The objections and reluctances I met with in soliciting the subscriptions,made me soon feel the impropriety of presenting one's self as theproposer of any useful project, that might be suppos'd to raise one'sreputation in the smallest degree above that of one's neighbors,when one has need of their assistance to accomplish that project.I therefore put myself as much as I could out of sight, and statedit as a scheme of a number of friends, who had requested me to goabout and propose it to such as they thought lovers of reading.In this way my affair went on more smoothly, and I ever afterpractis'd it on such occasions; and, from my frequent successes,can heartily recommend it.  The present little sacrifice of yourvanity will afterwards be amply repaid.  If it remains a whileuncertain to whom the merit belongs, some one more vain thanyourself will be encouraged to claim it, and then even envy willbe disposed to do you justice by plucking those assumed feathers,and restoring them to their right owner.This library afforded me the means of improvement by constant study,for which I set apart an hour or two each day, and thus repair'din some degree the loss of the learned education my father onceintended for me.  Reading was the only amusement I allow'd myself.I spent no time in taverns, games, or frolicks of any kind;and my industry in my business continu'd as indefatigableas it was necessary.  I was indebted for my printing-house;I had a young family coming on to be educated, and I had to contendwith for business two printers, who were established in the placebefore me.  My circumstances, however, grew daily easier.My original habits of frugality continuing, and my father having,among his instructions to me when a boy, frequently repeated a proverbof Solomon, 'Seest thou a man diligent in his calling, he shall standbefore kings, he shall not stand before mean men,' I from thenceconsidered industry as a means of obtaining wealth and distinction,which encourag'd me, tho' I did not think that I should everliterally stand before kings, which, however, has since happened;for I have stood before five, and even had the honor of sittingdown with one, the King of Denmark, to dinner.We have an English proverb that says, 'He that would thrive, must askhis wife.'  It was lucky for me that I had one as much dispos'dto industry and frugality as myself.  She assisted me cheerfullyin my business, folding and stitching pamphlets, tending shop,purchasing old linen rags for the papermakers, etc., etc.  We keptno idle servants, our table was plain and simple, our furnitureof the cheapest.  For instance, my breakfast was a long time breadand milk (no tea), and I ate it out of a twopenny earthen porringer,with a pewter spoon.  But mark how luxury will enter families,and make a progress, in spite of principle:  being call'd one morningto breakfast, I found it in a China bowl, with a spoon of silver!They had been bought for me without my knowledge by my wife,and had cost her the enormous sum of three-and-twenty shillings,for which she had no other excuse or apology to make, but that shethought her husband deserv'd a silver spoon and China bowl as wellas any of his neighbors.  This was the first appearance of plateand China in our house, which afterward, in a course of years,as our wealth increas'd, augmented gradually to several hundred poundsin value.I had been religiously educated as a Presbyterian; and tho'some of the dogmas of that persuasion, such as the eternal decreesof God, election, reprobation, etc., appeared to me unintelligible,others doubtful, and I early absented myself from the publicassemblies of the sect, Sunday being my studying day, I never waswithout some religious principles.  I never doubted, for instance,the existence of the Deity; that he made the world, and govern'dit by his Providence; that the most acceptable service of God wasthe doing good to man; that our souls are immortal; and that all crimewill be punished, and virtue rewarded, either here or hereafter.These I esteem'd the essentials of every religion; and, being tobe found in all the religions we had in our country, I respectedthem all, tho' with different degrees of respect, as I found themmore or less mix'd with other articles, which, without any tendencyto inspire, promote, or confirm morality, serv'd principallyto divide us, and make us unfriendly to one another.  This respectto all, with an opinion that the worst had some good effects,induc'd me to avoid all discourse that might tend to lessenthe good opinion another might have of his own religion; and asour province increas'd in people, and new places of worship werecontinually wanted, and generally erected by voluntary contributions,my mite for such purpose, whatever might be the sect, was never refused.Tho' I seldom attended any public worship, I had still an opinionof its propriety, and of its utility when rightly conducted,and I regularly paid my annual subscription for the support ofthe only Presbyterian minister or meeting we had in Philadelphia.He us'd to visit me sometimes as a friend, and admonish meto attend his administrations, and I was now and then prevail'don to do so, once for five Sundays successively.  Had he beenin my opinion a good preacher, perhaps I might have continued,notwithstanding the occasion I had for the Sunday's leisure in mycourse of study; but his discourses were chiefly either polemicarguments, or explications of the peculiar doctrines of our sect,and were all to me very dry, uninteresting, and unedifying,since not a single moral principle was inculcated or enforc'd, theiraim seeming to be rather to make us Presbyterians than good citizens.At length he took for his text that verse of the fourth chapterof Philippians, 'Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true,honest, just, pure, lovely, or of good report, if there be any virtue,or any praise, think on these things.'  And I imagin'd, in a sermonon such a text, we could not miss of having some morality.But he confin'd himself to five points only, as meant by the apostle,viz.: 1.  Keeping holy the Sabbath day.  2.  Being diligent in readingthe holy Scriptures.  3.  Attending duly the publick worship.4.  Partaking of the Sacrament.  5.  Paying a due respect toGod's ministers.  These might be all good things; but, as theywere not the kind of good things that I expected from that text,I despaired of ever meeting with them from any other, was disgusted,and attended his preaching no more.  I had some years before compos'da little Liturgy, or form of prayer, for my own private use (viz.,in 1728), entitled, Articles of Belief and Acts of Religion.I return'd to the use of this, and went no more to the public assemblies.My conduct might be blameable, but I leave it, without attemptingfurther to excuse it; my present purpose being to relate facts,and not to make apologies for them.It was about this time I conceiv'd the bold and arduous projectof arriving at moral perfection.  I wish'd to live withoutcommitting any fault at any time; I would conquer all that eithernatural inclination, custom, or company might lead me into.  As I knew,or thought I knew, what was right and wrong, I did not see why Imight not always do the one and avoid the other.  But I soon foundI had undertaken a task of more difficulty than I bad imagined.While my care was employ'd in guarding against one fault, I wasoften surprised by another; habit took the advantage of inattention;inclination was sometimes too strong for reason.  I concluded, at length,that the mere speculative conviction that it was our interest to becompletely virtuous, was not sufficient to prevent our slipping;and that the contrary habits must be broken, and good ones acquiredand established, before we can have any dependence on a steady,uniform rectitude of conduct.  For this purpose I therefore contrivedthe following method.In the various enumerations of the moral virtues I had metwith in my reading, I found the catalogue more or less numerous,as different writers included more or fewer ideas under the same name.Temperance, for example, was by some confined to eating and drinking,while by others it was extended to mean the moderating everyother pleasure, appetite, inclination, or passion, bodily or mental,even to our avarice and ambition.  I propos'd to myself, for the sakeof clearness, to use rather more names, with fewer ideas annex'dto each, than a few names with more ideas; and I included underthirteen names of virtues all that at that time occurr'd to meas necessary or desirable, and annexed to each a short precept,which fully express'd the extent I gave to its meaning.These names of virtues, with their precepts, were:1.  TEMPERANCE.  Eat not to dullness; drink not to elevation.2.  SILENCE.  Speak not but what may benefit others or yourself;avoid trifling conversation.3.  ORDER.  Let all your things have their places; let each partof your business have its time.4.  RESOLUTION.  Resolve to perform what you ought; perform withoutfail what you resolve.5.  FRUGALITY.  Make no expense but to do good to others or yourself;i.e., waste nothing.6.  INDUSTRY.  Lose no time; be always employ'd in something useful;cut off all unnecessary actions.7.  SINCERITY.  Use no hurtful deceit; think innocently and justly,and, if you speak, speak accordingly.8.  JUSTICE.  Wrong none by doing injuries, or omitting the benefitsthat are your duty.9.  MODERATION.  Avoid extreams; forbear resenting injuries so muchas you think they deserve.10.  CLEANLINESS.  Tolerate no uncleanliness in body, cloaths,or habitation.11.  TRANQUILLITY.  Be not disturbed at trifles, or at accidentscommon or unavoidable.12.  CHASTITY.  Rarely use venery but for health or offspring,never to dulness, weakness, or the injury of your own or another'speace or reputation.13.  HUMILITY.  Imitate Jesus and Socrates.My intention being to acquire the habitude of all these virtues,I judg'd it would be well not to distract my attention by attemptingthe whole at once, but to fix it on one of them at a time; and, when Ishould be master of that, then to proceed to another, and so on,till I should have gone thro' the thirteen; and, as the previousacquisition of some might facilitate the acquisition of certain others,I arrang'd them with that view, as they stand above.  Temperance first,as it tends to procure that coolness and clearness of head, which isso necessary where constant vigilance was to be kept up, and guardmaintained against the unremitting attraction of ancient habits,and the force of perpetual temptations.  This being acquir'dand establish'd, Silence would be more easy; and my desire beingto gain knowledge at the same time that I improv'd in virtue,and considering that in conversation it was obtain'd rather by the useof the ears than of the tongue, and therefore wishing to breaka habit I was getting into of prattling, punning, and joking,which only made me acceptable to trifling company, I gave Silencethe second place.  This and the next, Order, I expected wouldallow me more time for attending to my project and my studies.Resolution, once become habitual, would keep me firm in my endeavorsto obtain all the subsequent virtues; Frugality and Industry freeingme from my remaining debt, and producing affluence and independence,would make more easy the practice of Sincerity and Justice, etc., etc.Conceiving then, that, agreeably to the advice of Pythagorasin his Golden Verses, daily examination would be necessary,I contrived the following method for conducting that examination.I made a little book, in which I allotted a page for each of the virtues.I rul'd each page with red ink, so as to have seven columns,one for each day of the week, marking each column with a letterfor the day.  I cross'd these columns with thirteen red lines,marking the beginning of each line with the first letter of one ofthe virtues, on which line, and in its proper column, I might mark,by a little black spot, every fault I found upon examinationto have been committed respecting that virtue upon that day.Form of the pages.           +-------------------------------+           |              TEMPERANCE.      |           +-------------------------------+           |       EAT NOT TO DULNESS;     |           |     DRINK NOT TO ELEVATION.   |           +-------------------------------+           |   | S.| M.| T.| W.| T.| F.| S.|           +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+           | T.|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |           +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+           | S.| * | * |   | * |   | * |   |           +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+           | O.| **| * | * |   | * | * | * |           +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+           | R.|   |   | * |   |   | * |   |           +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+           | F.|   | * |   |   | * |   |   |           +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+           | I.|   |   | * |   |   |   |   |           +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+           | S.|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |           +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+           | J.|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |           +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+           | M.|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |           +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+           | C.|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |           +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+           | T.|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |           +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+           | C.|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |           +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+           | H.|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |           +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+I determined to give a week's strict attention to each ofthe virtues successively.  Thus, in the first week, my greatguard was to avoid every the least offence against Temperance,leaving the other virtues to their ordinary chance, only markingevery evening the faults of the day.  Thus, if in the first weekI could keep my first line, marked T, clear of spots, I suppos'dthe habit of that virtue so much strengthen'd and its oppositeweaken'd, that I might venture extending my attention to includethe next, and for the following week keep both lines clear of spots.Proceeding thus to the last, I could go thro' a course compleatin thirteen weeks, and four courses in a year.  And like him who,having a garden to weed, does not attempt to eradicate all the badherbs at once, which would exceed his reach and his strength, but workson one of the beds at a time, and, having accomplish'd the first,proceeds to a second, so I should have, I hoped, the encouragingpleasure of seeing on my pages the progress I made in virtue,by clearing successively my lines of their spots, till in the end,by a number of courses, I should he happy in viewing a clean book,after a thirteen weeks' daily examination.This my little book had for its motto these lines from Addison's Cato:          'Here will I hold.  If there's a power above us          (And that there is all nature cries aloud          Thro' all her works), He must delight in virtue;          And that which he delights in must be happy.'Another from Cicero,          'O vitae Philosophia dux! O virtutum indagatrix          expultrixque vitiorum! Unus dies, bene et ex praeceptis          tuis actus, peccanti immortalitati est anteponendus.'Another from the Proverbs of Solomon, speaking of wisdom or virtue:          'Length of days is in her right hand, and in her left hand          riches and honour.  Her ways are ways of pleasantness,          and all her paths are peace.' iii. 16, 17.And conceiving God to be the fountain of wisdom, I thought itright and necessary to solicit his assistance for obtaining it;to this end I formed the following little prayer, which was prefix'dto my tables of examination, for daily use.'O powerful Goodness! bountiful Father! merciful Guide!increase in me that wisdom which discovers my truest interest.strengthen my resolutions to perform what that wisdom dictates.Accept my kind offices to thy other children as the only returnin my power for thy continual favors to me.'I used also sometimes a little prayer which I took from Thomson's Poems,viz.:          'Father of light and life, thou Good Supreme!          O teach me what is good; teach me Thyself!          Save me from folly, vanity, and vice,          From every low pursuit; and fill my soul          With knowledge, conscious peace, and virtue pure;          Sacred, substantial, never-fading bliss!'The precept of Order requiring that every part of my business shouldhave its allotted time, one page in my little book contain'd thefollowing scheme of employment for the twenty-four hours of a natural day:     THE MORNING.            {  5 } Rise, wash, and address                             {    } Powerful Goodness!

After awhile I went thro' one course only in a year, and afterward onlyone in several years, till at length I omitted them entirely,being employ'd in voyages and business abroad, with a multiplicityof affairs that interfered; but I always carried my little bookwith me.My scheme of ORDER gave me the most trouble; and I found that, tho'it might be practicable where a man's business was such as to leavehim the disposition of his time, that of a journeyman printer,for instance, it was not possible to be exactly observed by a master,who must mix with the world, and often receive people of businessat their own hours.  Order, too, with regard to places for things,papers, etc., I found extreamly difficult to acquire.  I had notbeen early accustomed to it, and, having an exceeding good memory,I was not so sensible of the inconvenience attending want of method.This article, therefore, cost me so much painful attention, and my faultsin it vexed me so much, and I made so little progress in amendment,and had such frequent relapses, that I was almost ready to give upthe attempt, and content myself with a faulty character in that respect,like the man who, in buying an ax of a smith, my neighbour,desired to have the whole of its surface as bright as the edge.The smith consented to grind it bright for him if he would turnthe wheel; he turn'd, while the smith press'd the broad face ofthe ax hard and heavily on the stone, which made the turning of itvery fatiguing.  The man came every now and then from the wheel to seehow the work went on, and at length would take his ax as it was,without farther grinding.  'No,' said the smith, 'turn on, turn on;we shall have it bright by-and-by; as yet, it is only speckled.''Yes,' said the man, 'but I think I like a speckled ax best.'And I believe this may have been the case with many, who, having,for want of some such means as I employ'd, found the difficultyof obtaining good and breaking bad habits in other points of viceand virtue, have given up the struggle, and concluded that 'aspeckled ax was best'; for something, that pretended to be reason,was every now and then suggesting to me that such extream nicety as Iexacted of myself might be a kind of foppery in morals, which, if itwere known, would make me ridiculous; that a perfect charactermight be attended with the inconvenience of being envied and hated;and that a benevolent man should allow a few faults in himself,to keep his friends in countenance.In truth, I found myself incorrigible with respect to Order;and now I am grown old, and my memory bad, I feel very sensiblythe want of it.  But, on the whole, tho' I never arrived atthe perfection I had been so ambitious of obtaining, but fell farshort of it, yet I was, by the endeavour, a better and a happierman than I otherwise should have been if I had not attempted it;as those who aim at perfect writing by imitating the engraved copies,tho' they never reach the wish'd-for excellence of those copies,their hand is mended by the endeavor, and is tolerable while itcontinues fair and legible.It may be well my posterity should be informed that to thislittle artifice, with the blessing of God, their ancestor ow'd theconstant felicity of his life, down to his 79th year, in which thisis written.  What reverses may attend the remainder is in the handof Providence; but, if they arrive, the reflection on past happinessenjoy'd ought to help his bearing them with more resignation.To Temperance he ascribes his long-continued health, and what isstill left to him of a good constitution; to Industry and Frugality,the early easiness of his circumstances and acquisition of his fortune,with all that knowledge that enabled him to be a useful citizen,and obtained for him some degree of reputation among the learned;to Sincerity and Justice, the confidence of his country,and the honorable employs it conferred upon him; and to the jointinfluence of the whole mass of the virtues, even in the imperfectstate he was able to acquire them, all that evenness of temper,and that cheerfulness in conversation, which makes his companystill sought for, and agreeable even to his younger acquaintance.I hope, therefore, that some of my descendants may follow the exampleand reap the benefit.It will be remark'd that, tho' my scheme was not wholly without religion,there was in it no mark of any of the distinguishing tenets of anyparticular sect.  I had purposely avoided them; for, being fullypersuaded of the utility and excellency of my method, and that itmight be serviceable to people in all religions, and intendingsome time or other to publish it, I would not have any thingin it that should prejudice any one, of any sect, against it.I purposed writing a little comment on each virtue, in which Iwould have shown the advantages of possessing it, and the mischiefsattending its opposite vice; and I should have called my book THEART OF VIRTUE,<7> because it would have shown the means and mannerof obtaining virtue, which would have distinguished it from the mereexhortation to be good, that does not instruct and indicate the means,but is like the apostle's man of verbal charity, who only withoutshowing to the naked and hungry how or where they might get clothesor victuals, exhorted them to be fed and clothed.--James ii.  15, 16.     <7> Nothing so likely to make a man's fortune as virtue.         --[Marg. note.]But it so happened that my intention of writing and publishing thiscomment was never fulfilled.  I did, indeed, from time to time,put down short hints of the sentiments, reasonings, etc., to be madeuse of in it, some of which I have still by me; but the necessaryclose attention to private business in the earlier part of thy life,and public business since, have occasioned my postponing it; for,it being connected in my mind with a great and extensive project,that required the whole man to execute, and which an unforeseensuccession of employs prevented my attending to, it has hithertoremain'd unfinish'd.In this piece it was my design to explain and enforce this doctrine,that vicious actions are not hurtful because they are forbidden,but forbidden because they are hurtful, the nature of manalone considered; that it was, therefore, every one's interest to bevirtuous who wish'd to be happy even in this world; and I should,from this circumstance (there being always in the world a numberof rich merchants, nobility, states, and princes, who have needof honest instruments for the management of their affairs,and such being so rare), have endeavored to convince young personsthat no qualities were so likely to make a poor man's fortuneas those of probity and integrity.My list of virtues contain'd at first but twelve; but a Quakerfriend having kindly informed me that I was generally thought proud;that my pride show'd itself frequently in conversation; that Iwas not content with being in the right when discussing any point,but was overbearing, and rather insolent, of which he convinc'dme by mentioning several instances; I determined endeavouringto cure myself, if I could, of this vice or folly among the rest,and I added Humility to my list, giving an extensive meaning tothe word.I cannot boast of much success in acquiring the reality of this virtue,but I had a good deal with regard to the appearance of it.I made it a rule to forbear all direct contradiction to thesentiments of others, and all positive assertion of my own.I even forbid myself, agreeably to the old laws of our Junto,the use of every word or expression in the language that importeda fix'd opinion, such as certainly, undoubtedly, etc., and I adopted,instead of them, I conceive, I apprehend, or I imagine a thing to beso or so; or it so appears to me at present.  When another assertedsomething that I thought an error, I deny'd myself the pleasureof contradicting him abruptly, and of showing immediately someabsurdity in his proposition; and in answering I began by observingthat in certain cases or circumstances his opinion would be right,but in the present case there appear'd or seem'd to me some difference,etc.  I soon found the advantage of this change in my manner;the conversations I engag'd in went on more pleasantly.  The modestway in which I propos'd my opinions procur'd them a readier receptionand less contradiction; I had less mortification when I was foundto be in the wrong, and I more easily prevail'd with others to giveup their mistakes and join with me when I happened to be in the right.And this mode, which I at first put on with some violence tonatural inclination, became at length so easy, and so habitualto me, that perhaps for these fifty years past no one has everheard a dogmatical expression escape me.  And to this habit (aftermy character of integrity) I think it principally owing that Ihad early so much weight with my fellow-citizens when I proposednew institutions, or alterations in the old, and so much influencein public councils when I became a member; for I was but a bad speaker,never eloquent, subject to much hesitation in my choice of words,hardly correct in language, and yet I generally carried my points.In reality, there is, perhaps, no one of our natural passionsso hard to subdue as pride.  Disguise it, struggle with it,beat it down, stifle it, mortify it as much as one pleases, it isstill alive, and will every now and then peep out and show itself;you will see it, perhaps, often in this history; for, even if Icould conceive that I had compleatly overcome it, I should probablybe proud of my humility.[Thus far written at Passy, 1784.]['I am now about to write at home, August, 1788, but can not havethe help expected from my papers, many of them being lost in the war.I have, however, found the following.']<8>     <8>This is a marginal memorandum.--B.HAVING mentioned a great and extensive project which I hadconceiv'd, it seems proper that some account should be heregiven of that project and its object.  Its first rise in mymind appears in the following little paper, accidentally preserv'd, viz.:Observations on my reading history, in Library, May 19th, 1731.'That the great affairs of the world, the wars, revolutions,etc., are carried on and affected by parties.'That the view of these parties is their present general interest,or what they take to be such.'That the different views of these different parties occasionall confusion.'That while a party is carrying on a general design, each man hashis particular private interest in view.'That as soon as a party has gain'd its general point, each memberbecomes intent upon his particular interest; which, thwarting others,breaks that party into divisions, and occasions more confusion.'That few in public affairs act from a meer view of the good oftheir country, whatever they may pretend; and, tho' their actingsbring real good to their country, yet men primarily consideredthat their own and their country's interest was united, and didnot act from a principle of benevolence.'That fewer still, in public affairs, act with a view to the goodof mankind.'There seems to me at present to be great occasion for raisinga United Party for Virtue, by forming the virtuous and good menof all nations into a regular body, to be govern'd by suitablegood and wise rules, which good and wise men may probably be moreunanimous in their obedience to, than common people are to common laws.'I at present think that whoever attempts this aright, and iswell qualified, can not fail of pleasing God, and of meetingwith success.  B. F.'Revolving this project in my mind, as to be undertaken hereafter,when my circumstances should afford me the necessary leisure,I put down from time to time, on pieces of paper, such thoughtsas occurr'd to me respecting it.  Most of these are lost; but I findone purporting to be the substance of an intended creed, containing,as I thought, the essentials of every known religion, and being freeof every thing that might shock the professors of any religion.It is express'd in these words, viz.:'That there is one God, who made all things.'That he governs the world by his providence.'That he ought to be worshiped by adoration, prayer, and thanksgiving.'But that the most acceptable service of God is doing good to man.'That the soul is immortal.'And that God will certainly reward virtue and punish vice eitherhere or hereafter.'<9>     <9> In the Middle Ages, 
ENTP	, if such a phenomenon as were possible in the Middle Ages, would         probably have been the founder of a monastic order.--B.My ideas at that time were, that the sect should be begun andspread at first among young and single men only; that each personto be initiated should not only declare his assent to such creed,but should have exercised himself with the thirteen weeks'examination and practice of the virtues, as in the before-mention'd model;that the existence of such a society should he kept a secret,till it was become considerable, to prevent solicitationsfor the admission of improper persons, but that the membersshould each of them search among his acquaintance for ingenuous,well-disposed youths, to whom, with prudent caution, the schemeshould be gradually communicated; that the members should engageto afford their advice, assistance, and support to each otherin promoting one another's interests, business, and advancementin life; that, for distinction, we should be call'd The Society ofthe Free and Easy:  free, as being, by the general practice and habitof the virtues, free from the dominion of vice; and particularlyby the practice of industry and frugality, free from debt, whichexposes a man to confinement, and a species of slavery to his creditors.This is as much as I can now recollect of the project,except that I communicated it in part to two young men, who adoptedit with some enthusiasm; but my then narrow circumstances,and the necessity I was under of sticking close to my business,occasion'd my postponing the further prosecution of it at that time;and my multifarious occupations, public and private, induc'd meto continue postponing, so that it has been omitted till I have nolonger strength or activity left sufficient for such an enterprise;tho' I am still of opinion that it was a practicable scheme,and might have been very useful, by forming a great number ofgood citizens; and I was not discourag'd by the seeming magnitudeof the undertaking, as I have always thought that one man of tolerableabilities may work great changes, and accomplish great affairsamong mankind, if he first forms a good plan, and, cutting off allamusements or other employments that would divert his attention,makes the execution of that same plan his sole study and business.In 1732 I first publish'd my Almanack, under the name of Richard Saunders;it was continu'd by me about twenty-five years, commonly call'dPoor Richard's Almanac.  I endeavor'd to make it both entertainingand useful, and it accordingly came to be in such demand, that I reap'dconsiderable profit from it, vending annually near ten thousand.And observing that it was generally read, scarce any neighborhoodin the province being without it, I consider'd it as a proper vehiclefor conveying instruction among the common people, who bought scarcelyany other books; I therefore filled all the little spaces that occurr'dbetween the remarkable days in the calendar with proverbial sentences,chiefly such as inculcated industry and frugality, as the meansof procuring wealth, and thereby securing virtue; it being moredifficult for a man in want, to act always honestly, as, to usehere one of those proverbs, it is hard for an empty sack to stand up-right.These proverbs, which contained the wisdom of many ages and nations,I assembled and form'd into a connected discourse prefix'd to theAlmanack of 1757, as the harangue of a wise old man to the peopleattending an auction.  The bringing all these scatter'd counselsthus into a focus enabled them to make greater impression.The piece, being universally approved, was copied in all thenewspapers of the Continent; reprinted in Britain on a broad side,to be stuck up in houses; two translations were made of it in French,and great numbers bought by the clergy and gentry, to distributegratis among their poor parishioners and tenants.  In Pennsylvania,as it discouraged useless expense in foreign superfluities, some thoughtit had its share of influence in producing that growing plentyof money which was observable for several years after its publication.I considered my newspaper, also, as another means of communicatinginstruction, and in that view frequently reprinted in it extractsfrom the Spectator, and other moral writers; and sometimes publish'dlittle pieces of my own, which had been first compos'd for readingin our Junto.  Of these are a Socratic dialogue, tending to prove that,whatever might be his parts and abilities, a vicious man could notproperly be called a man of sense; and a discourse on self-denial,showing that virtue was not secure till its practice became a habitude,and was free from the opposition of contrary inclinations.These may be found in the papers about the beginning Of 1735.In the conduct of my newspaper, I carefully excluded all libellingand personal abuse, which is of late years become so disgracefulto our country.  Whenever I was solicited to insert anythingof that kind, and the writers pleaded, as they generally did,the liberty of the press, and that a newspaper was like a stagecoach,in which any one who would pay had a right to a place, my answer was,that I would print the piece separately if desired, and the authormight have as many copies as he pleased to distribute himself,but that I would not take upon me to spread his detraction;and that, having contracted with my subscribers to furnish themwith what might be either useful or entertaining, I could not filltheir papers with private altercation, in which they had no concern,without doing them manifest injustice.  Now, many of our printers makeno scruple of gratifying the malice of individuals by false accusationsof the fairest characters among ourselves, augmenting animosityeven to the producing of duels; and are, moreover, so indiscreetas to print scurrilous reflections on the government of neighboringstates, and even on the conduct of our best national allies,which may be attended with the most pernicious consequences.These things I mention as a caution to young printers, and thatthey may be encouraged not to pollute their presses and disgracetheir profession by such infamous practices, but refuse steadily,as they may see by my example that such a course of conduct will not,on the whole, be injurious to their interests.In 1733 I sent one of my journeymen to Charleston, South Carolina,where a printer was wanting.  I furnish'd him with a press and letters,on an agreement of partnership, by which I was to receive one-thirdof the profits of the business, paying one-third of the expense.He was a man of learning, and honest but ignorant in mattersof account; and, tho' he sometimes made me remittances, I could getno account from him, nor any satisfactory state of our partnershipwhile he lived.  On his decease, the business was continued byhis widow, who, being born and bred in Holland, where, as I have beeninform'd, the knowledge of accounts makes a part of female education,she not only sent me as clear a state as she could find of thetransactions past, but continued to account with the greatestregularity and exactness every quarter afterwards, and managedthe business with such success, that she not only brought up reputablya family of children, but, at the expiration of the term, was ableto purchase of me the printing-house, and establish her son in it.I mention this affair chiefly for the sake of recommending that branchof education for our young females, as likely to be of more useto them and their children, in case of widowhood, than either musicor dancing, by preserving them from losses by imposition of crafty men,and enabling them to continue, perhaps, a profitable mercantile house,with establish'd correspondence, till a son is grown up fit to undertakeand go on with it, to the lasting advantage and enriching of the family.About the year 1734 there arrived among us from Ireland a youngPresbyterian preacher, named Hemphill, who delivered with agood voice, and apparently extempore, most excellent discourses,which drew together considerable numbers of different persuasion,who join'd in admiring them.  Among the rest, I became one of hisconstant hearers, his sermons pleasing me, as they had littleof the dogmatical kind, but inculcated strongly the practiceof virtue, or what in the religious stile are called good works.Those, however, of our congregation, who considered themselvesas orthodox Presbyterians, disapprov'd his doctrine, and were join'dby most of the old clergy, who arraign'd him of heterodoxy beforethe synod, in order to have him silenc'd. I became his zealous partisan,and contributed all I could to raise a party in his favour, and wecombated for him a while with some hopes of success.  There was muchscribbling pro and con upon the occasion; and finding that, tho'an elegant preacher, he was but a poor writer, I lent him my penand wrote for him two or three pamphlets, and one piece in the Gazetteof April, 1735.  Those pamphlets, as is generally the case withcontroversial writings, tho' eagerly read at the time, were soonout of vogue, and I question whether a single copy of them now exists.During the contest an unlucky occurrence hurt his cause exceedingly.One of our adversaries having heard him preach a sermon that wasmuch admired, thought he had somewhere read the sermon before,or at least a part of it.  On search he found that part quotedat length, in one of the British Reviews, from a discourseof Dr. Foster's. This detection gave many of our party disgust,who accordingly abandoned his cause, and occasion'd our more speedydiscomfiture in the synod.  I stuck by him, however, as I ratherapprov'd his giving us good sermons compos'd by others, than badones of his own manufacture, tho' the latter was the practiceof our common teachers.  He afterward acknowledg'd to me that noneof those he preach'd were his own; adding, that his memory was suchas enabled him to retain and repeat any sermon after one reading only.On our defeat, he left us in search elsewhere of better fortune,and I quitted the congregation, never joining it after, tho' I continu'dmany years my subscription for the support of its ministers.I had begun in 1733 to study languages; I soon made myself so mucha master of the French as to be able to read the books with ease.I then undertook the Italian.  An acquaintance, who was alsolearning it, us'd often to tempt me to play chess with him.Finding this took up too much of the time I had to spare for study,I at length refus'd to play any more, unless on this condition,that the victor in every game should have a right to impose a task,either in parts of the grammar to be got by heart, or in translations,etc., which tasks the vanquish'd was to perform upon honour,before our next meeting.  As we play'd pretty equally, we thus beatone another into that language.  I afterwards with a little painstaking,acquir'd as much of the Spanish as to read their books also.I have already mention'd that I had only one year's instructionin a Latin school, and that when very young, after which I neglectedthat language entirely.  But, when I had attained an acquaintancewith the French, Italian, and Spanish, I was surpriz'd to find,on looking over a Latin Testament, that I understood so much moreof that language than I had imagined, which encouraged me to applymyself again to the study of it, and I met with more success,as those preceding languages had greatly smooth'd my way.From these circumstances, I have thought that there is some inconsistencyin our common mode of teaching languages.  We are told that it isproper to begin first with the Latin, and, having acquir'd that,it will be more easy to attain those modern languages which arederiv'd from it; and yet we do not begin with the Greek, in ordermore easily to acquire the Latin.  It is true that, if you canclamber and get to the top of a staircase without using the steps,you will more easily gain them in descending; but certainly, if youbegin with the lowest you will with more ease ascend to the top;and I would therefore offer it to the consideration of those whosuperintend the education of our youth, whether, since many ofthose who begin with the Latin quit the same after spending someyears without having made any great proficiency, and what they havelearnt becomes almost useless, so that their time has been lost,it would not have been better to have begun with the French,proceeding to the Italian, etc.; for, tho', after spending the same time,they should quit the study of languages and never arrive atthe Latin, they would, however, have acquired another tongue or two,that, being in modern use, might be serviceable to them in common life.After ten years' absence from Boston, and having become easy inmy circumstances, I made a journey thither to visit my relations,which I could not sooner well afford.  In returning, I call'd at Newportto see my brother, then settled there with his printing-house. Ourformer differences were forgotten, and our meeting was very cordialand affectionate.  He was fast declining in his health, and requestedof me that, in case of his death, which he apprehended not far distant,I would take home his son, then but ten years of age, and bring himup to the printing business.  This I accordingly perform'd, sendinghim a few years to school before I took him into the office.His mother carried on the business till he was grown up, when Iassisted him with an assortment of new types, those of his fatherbeing in a manner worn out.  Thus it was that I made my brother ampleamends for the service I had depriv'd him of by leaving him so early.In 1736 I lost one of my sons, a fine boy of four years old,by the small-pox, taken in the common way.  I long regretted bitterly,and still regret that I had not given it to him by inoculation.This I mention for the sake of parents who omit that operation,on the supposition that they should never forgive themselvesif a child died under it; my example showing that the regretmay be the same either way, and that, therefore, the safer shouldbe chosen.Our club, the Junto, was found so useful, and afforded such satisfactionto the members, that several were desirous of introducing their friends,which could not well be done without exceeding what we had settledas a convenient number, viz., twelve.  We had from the beginningmade it a rule to keep our institution a secret, which was prettywell observ'd; the intention was to avoid applications of improperpersons for admittance, some of whom, perhaps, we might findit difficult to refuse.  I was one of those who were againstany addition to our number, but, instead of it, made in writinga proposal, that every member separately should endeavor to forma subordinate club, with the same rules respecting queries,etc., and without informing them of the connection with the Junto.The advantages proposed were, the improvement of so many more youngcitizens by the use of our institutions; our better acquaintancewith the general sentiments of the inhabitants on any occasion,as the Junto member might propose what queries we should desire,and was to report to the Junto what pass'd in his separate club;the promotion of our particular interests in business by moreextensive recommendation, and the increase of our influencein public affairs, and our power of doing good by spreading thro'the several clubs the sentiments of the Junto.The project was approv'd, and every member undertook to form his club,but they did not all succeed.  Five or six only were compleated,which were called by different names, as the Vine, the Union,the Band, etc.  They were useful to themselves, and afforded us a gooddeal of amusement, information, and instruction, besides answering,in some considerable degree, our views of influencing the publicopinion on particular occasions, of which I shall give some instancesin course of time as they happened.My first promotion was my being chosen, in 1736, clerk of theGeneral Assembly.  The choice was made that year without opposition;but the year following, when I was again propos'd (the choice,like that of the members, being annual), a new member made a longspeech against me, in order to favour some other candidate.I was, however, chosen, which was the more agreeable to me, as,besides the pay for the immediate service as clerk, the place gaveme a better opportunity of keeping up an interest among the members,which secur'd to me the business of printing the votes, laws, paper money,and other occasional jobbs for the public, that, on the whole,were very profitable.I therefore did not like the opposition of this new member, who wasa gentleman of fortune and education, with talents that were likelyto give him, in time, great influence in the House, which, indeed,afterwards happened.  I did not, however, aim at gaining hisfavour by paying any servile respect to him, but, after some time,took this other method.  Having heard that he had in his librarya certain very scarce and curious book, I wrote a note to him,expressing my desire of perusing that book, and requesting hewould do me the favour of lending it to me for a few days.He sent it immediately, and I return'd it in about a weekwith another note, expressing strongly my sense of the favour.When we next met in the House, he spoke to me (which he hadnever done before), and with great civility; and he ever aftermanifested a readiness to serve me on all occasions, so that webecame great friends, and our friendship continued to his death.This is another instance of the truth of an old maxim I had learned,which says, 'He that has once done you a kindness will be moreready to do you another, than he whom you yourself have obliged.'And it shows how much more profitable it is prudently to remove,than to resent, return, and continue inimical proceedings.In 1737, Colonel Spotswood, late governor of Virginia, and thenpostmaster-general, being dissatisfied with the conduct of hisdeputy at Philadelphia, respecting some negligence in rendering,and inexactitude of his accounts, took from him the commission and offeredit to me.  I accepted it readily, and found it of great advantage;for, tho' the salary was small, it facilitated the correspondencethat improv'd my newspaper, increas'd the number demanded, as wellas the advertisements to be inserted, so that it came to affordme a considerable income.  My old competitor's newspaper declin'dproportionably, and I was satisfy'd without retaliating his refusal,while postmaster, to permit my papers being carried by the riders.Thus he suffer'd greatly from his neglect in due accounting; and Imention it as a lesson to those young men who may be employ'd inmanaging affairs for others, that they should always render accounts,and make remittances, with great clearness and punctuality.The character of observing such a conduct is the most powerfulof all recommendations to new employments and increase of business.I began now to turn my thoughts a little to public affairs,beginning, however, with small matters.  The city watch wasone of the first things that I conceiv'd to want regulation.It was managed by the constables of the respective wards in turn;the constable warned a number of housekeepers to attend him forthe night.  Those who chose never to attend paid him six shillingsa year to be excus'd, which was suppos'd to be for hiring substitutes,but was, in reality, much more than was necessary for that purpose,and made the constableship a place of profit; and the constable,for a little drink, often got such ragamuffins about him as a watch,that respectable housekeepers did not choose to mix with.Walking the rounds, too, was often neglected, and most of the nightsspent in tippling.  I thereupon wrote a paper, to be read in Junto,representing these irregularities, but insisting more particularlyon the inequality of this six-shilling tax of the constables,respecting the circumstances of those who paid it, since a poorwidow housekeeper, all whose property to be guarded by the watchdid not perhaps exceed the value of fifty pounds, paid as much asthe wealthiest merchant, who had thousands of pounds worth of goodsin his stores.On the whole, I proposed as a more effectual watch, the hiringof proper men to serve constantly in that business; and as a moreequitable way of supporting the charge the levying a tax thatshould be proportion'd to the property.  This idea, being approv'dby the Junto, was communicated to the other clubs, but as arisingin each of them; and though the plan was not immediately carriedinto execution, yet, by preparing the minds of people for the change,it paved the way for the law obtained a few years after,when the members of our clubs were grown into more influence.About this time I wrote a paper (first to be read in Junto, but itwas afterward publish'd) on the different accidents and carelessnessesby which houses were set on fire, with cautions against them,and means proposed of avoiding them.  This was much spoken of as auseful piece, and gave rise to a project, which soon followed it,of forming a company for the more ready extinguishing of fires,and mutual assistance in removing and securing the goods when in danger.Associates in this scheme were presently found, amounting to thirty.Our articles of agreement oblig'd every member to keep always ingood order, and fit for use, a certain number of leather buckets,with strong bags and baskets (for packing and transporting of goods),which were to be brought to every fire; and we agreed to meet oncea month and spend a social evening together, in discoursing andcommunicating such ideas as occurred to us upon the subject of fires,as might be useful in our conduct on such occasions.The utility of this institution soon appeared, and many more desiringto be admitted than we thought convenient for one company, they wereadvised to form another, which was accordingly done; and this went on,one new company being formed after another, till they became so numerousas to include most of the inhabitants who were men of property;and now, at the time of my writing this, tho' upward of fifty yearssince its establishment, that which I first formed, called the UnionFire Company, still subsists and flourishes, tho' the first membersare all deceas'd but myself and one, who is older by a year than I am.The small fines that have been paid by members for absence at the monthlymeetings have been apply'd to the purchase of fire-engines, ladders,fire-hooks, and other useful implements for each company, so that Iquestion whether there is a city in the world better provided withthe means of putting a stop to beginning conflagrations; and, in fact,since these institutions, the city has never lost by fire morethan one or two houses at a time, and the flames have often beenextinguished before the house in which they began has been half consumed.In 1739 arrived among us from Ireland the Reverend Mr. Whitefield,who had made himself remarkable there as an itinerant preacher.He was at first permitted to preach in some of our churches;but the clergy, taking a dislike to him, soon refus'd him their pulpits,and he was oblig'd to preach in the fields.  The multitudes of allsects and denominations that attended his sermons were enormous,and it was matter of speculation to me, who was one of the number,to observe the extraordinary influence of his oratory on his hearers,and how much they admir'd and respected him, notwithstanding hiscommon abuse of them, by assuring them that they were naturally halfbeasts and half devils.  It was wonderful to see the change soonmade in the manners of our inhabitants.  From being thoughtlessor indifferent about religion, it seem'd as if all the worldwere growing religious, so that one could not walk thro' the townin an evening without hearing psalms sung in different families ofevery street.And it being found inconvenient to assemble in the open air,subject to its inclemencies, the building of a house to meet in wasno sooner propos'd, and persons appointed to receive contributions,but sufficient sums were soon receiv'd to procure the ground and erectthe building, which was one hundred feet long and seventy broad,about the size of Westminster Hall; and the work was carried onwith such spirit as to be finished in a much shorter time than couldhave been expected.  Both house and ground were vested in trustees,expressly for the use of any preacher of any religious persuasionwho might desire to say something to the people at Philadelphia;the design in building not being to accommodate any particular sect,but the inhabitants in general; so that even if the Mufti ofConstantinople were to send a missionary to preach Mohammedanism to us,he would find a pulpit at his service.Mr. Whitefield, in leaving us, went preaching all the way thro'the colonies to Georgia.  The settlement of that provincehad lately been begun, but, instead of being made with hardy,industrious husbandmen, accustomed to labor, the only people fitfor such an enterprise, it was with families of broken shop-keepersand other insolvent debtors, many of indolent and idle habits,taken out of the jails, who, being set down in the woods, unqualified forclearing land, and unable to endure the hardships of a new settlement,perished in numbers, leaving many helpless children unprovided for.The sight of their miserable situation inspir'd the benevolent heartof Mr. Whitefield with the idea of building an Orphan House there,in which they might be supported and educated.  Returning northward,he preach'd up this charity, and made large collections,for his eloquence had a wonderful power over the hearts and pursesof his hearers, of which I myself was an instance.I did not disapprove of the design, but, as Georgia was thendestitute of materials and workmen, and it was proposed to sendthem from Philadelphia at a great expense, I thought it would havebeen better to have built the house here, and brought the childrento it.  This I advis'd; but he was resolute in his first project,rejected my counsel, and I therefore refus'd to contribute.I happened soon after to attend one of his sermons, in the courseof which I perceived he intended to finish with a collection,and I silently resolved he should get nothing from me, I had in mypocket a handful of copper money, three or four silver dollars,and five pistoles in gold.  As he proceeded I began to soften,and concluded to give the coppers.  Another stroke of his oratorymade me asham'd of that, and determin'd me to give the silver;and he finish'd so admirably, that I empty'd my pocket wholly intothe collector's dish, gold and all.  At this sermon there was alsoone of our club, who, being of my sentiments respecting the buildingin Georgia, and suspecting a collection might be intended, had,by precaution, emptied his pockets before he came from home.Towards the conclusion of the discourse, however, he felt a strongdesire to give, and apply'd to a neighbour, who stood near him,to borrow some money for the purpose.  The application wasunfortunately [made] to perhaps the only man in the company who hadthe firmness not to be affected by the preacher.  His answer was,'At any other time, Friend Hopkinson, I would lend to thee freely;but not now, for thee seems to be out of thy right senses.'Some of Mr. Whitefield's enemies affected to suppose that he wouldapply these collections to his own private emolument; but I who wasintimately acquainted with him (being employed in printing his Sermonsand Journals, etc.), never had the least suspicion of his integrity,but am to this day decidedly of opinion that he was in all his conducta perfectly honest man, and methinks my testimony in his favourought to have the more weight, as we had no religious connection.He us'd, indeed, sometimes to pray for my conversion, but neverhad the satisfaction of believing that his prayers were heard.Ours was a mere civil friendship, sincere on both sides, and lastedto his death.The following instance will show something of the terms on whichwe stood.  Upon one of his arrivals from England at Boston,he wrote to me that he should come soon to Philadelphia,but knew not where he could lodge when there, as he understoodhis old friend and host, Mr. Benezet, was removed to Germantown.My answer was, 'You know my house; if you can make shift withits scanty accommodations, you will be most heartily welcome.'He reply'd, that if I made that kind offer for Christ's sake,I should not miss of a reward.  And I returned, 'Don't let mebe mistaken; it was not for Christ's sake, but for your sake.'One of our common acquaintance jocosely remark'd, that, knowing itto be the custom of the saints, when they received any favour,to shift the burden of the obligation from off their own shoulders,and place it in heaven, I had contriv'd to fix it on earth.The last time I saw Mr. Whitefield was in London, when he consultedme about his Orphan House concern, and his purpose of appropriatingit to the establishment of a college.He had a loud and clear voice, and articulated his words andsentences so perfectly, that he might be heard and understood ata great distance, especially as his auditories, however numerous,observ'd the most exact silence.  He preach'd one evening from the topof the Court-house steps, which are in the middle of Market-street,and on the west side of Second-street, which crosses it at right angles.Both streets were fill'd with his hearers to a considerable distance.Being among the hindmost in Market-street, I had the curiosityto learn how far he could be heard, by retiring backwards downthe street towards the river; and I found his voice distinct till Icame near Front-street, when some noise in that street obscur'd it.Imagining then a semi-circle, of which my distance should be the radius,and that it were fill'd with auditors, to each of whom I allow'dtwo square feet, I computed that he might well be heard by morethan thirty thousand.  This reconcil'd me to the newspaper accountsof his having preach'd to twenty-five thousand people in the fields,and to the antient histories of generals haranguing whole armies,of which I had sometimes doubted.By hearing him often, I came to distinguish easily between sermonsnewly compos'd, and those which he had often preach'd in the courseof his travels.  His delivery of the latter was so improv'd by frequentrepetitions that every accent, every emphasis, every modulationof voice, was so perfectly well turn'd and well plac'd, that,without being interested in the subject, one could not help beingpleas'd with the discourse; a pleasure of much the same kind with thatreceiv'd from an excellent piece of musick.  This is an advantageitinerant preachers have over those who are stationary, as the lattercan not well improve their delivery of a sermon by so many rehearsals.His writing and printing from time to time gave great advantageto his enemies; unguarded expressions, and even erroneous opinions,delivered in preaching, might have been afterwards explain'dor qualifi'd by supposing others that might have accompani'd them,or they might have been deny'd; but litera scripta monet.Critics attack'd his writings violently, and with so much appearanceof reason as to diminish the number of his votaries and preventtheir encrease; so that I am of opinion if he had never writtenany thing, he would have left behind him a much more numerousand important sect, and his reputation might in that case have beenstill growing, even after his death, as there being nothing of hiswriting on which to found a censure and give him a lower character,his proselytes would be left at liberty to feign for him as greata variety of excellence as their enthusiastic admiration might wishhim to have possessed.My business was now continually augmenting, and my circumstances growingdaily easier, my newspaper having become very profitable, as beingfor a time almost the only one in this and the neighbouring provinces.I experienced, too, the truth of the observation, 'that aftergetting the first hundred pound, it is more easy to get the second,'money itself being of a prolific nature.The partnership at Carolina having succeeded, I was encourag'dto engage in others, and to promote several of my workmen,who had behaved well, by establishing them with printing-housesin different colonies, on the same terms with that in Carolina.Most of them did well, being enabled at the end of our term, six years,to purchase the types of me and go on working for themselves,by which means several families were raised.  Partnerships oftenfinish in quarrels; but I was happy in this, that mine were allcarried on and ended amicably, owing, I think, a good deal tothe precaution of having very explicitly settled, in our articles,every thing to be done by or expected from each partner, so thatthere was nothing to dispute, which precaution I would thereforerecommend to all who enter into partnerships; for, whatever esteempartners may have for, and confidence in each other at the timeof the contract, little jealousies and disgusts may arise, with ideasof inequality in the care and burden of the business, etc., whichare attended often with breach of friendship and of the connection,perhaps with lawsuits and other disagreeable consequences.I had, on the whole, abundant reason to be satisfied with my beingestablished in Pennsylvania.  There were, however, two thingsthat I regretted, there being no provision for defense, nor fora compleat education of youth; no militia, nor any college.I therefore, in 1743, drew up a proposal for establishing an academy;and at that time, thinking the Reverend Mr. Peters, who was outof employ, a fit person to superintend such an institution,I communicated the project to him; but he, having more profitableviews in the service of the proprietaries, which succeeded,declin'd the undertaking; and, not knowing another at that timesuitable for such a trust, I let the scheme lie a while dormant.I succeeded better the next year, 1744, in proposing and establishinga Philosophical Society.  The paper I wrote for that purpose willbe found among my writings, when collected.With respect to defense, Spain having been several years at waragainst Great Britain, and being at length join'd by France,which brought us into great danger; and the laboured and long-continuedendeavour of our governor, Thomas, to prevail with our Quaker Assemblyto pass a militia law, and make other provisions for the securityof the province, having proved abortive, I determined to try what mightbe done by a voluntary association of the people.  To promote this,I first wrote and published a pamphlet, entitled PLAIN TRUTH, in which Istated our defenceless situation in strong lights, with the necessityof union and discipline for our defense, and promis'd to propose ina few days an association, to be generally signed for that purpose.The pamphlet had a sudden and surprising effect.  I was call'd uponfor the instrument of association, and having settled the draftof it with a few friends, I appointed a meeting of the citizensin the large building before mentioned.  The house was pretty full;I had prepared a number of printed copies, and provided pens and inkdispers'd all over the room.  I harangued them a little on the subject,read the paper, and explained it, and then distributed the copies,which were eagerly signed, not the least objection being made.When the company separated, and the papers were collected, we foundabove twelve hundred hands; and, other copies being dispersedin the country, the subscribers amounted at length to upwardof ten thousand.  These all furnished themselves as soon as theycould with arms, formed themselves into companies and regiments,chose their own officers, and met every week to be instructedin the manual exercise, and other parts of military discipline.The women, by subscriptions among themselves, provided silk colors,which they presented to the companies, painted with different devicesand mottos, which I supplied.The officers of the companies composing the Philadelphia regiment,being met, chose me for their colonel; but, conceiving myself unfit,I declin'd that station, and recommended Mr. Lawrence, a fineperson, and man of influence, who was accordingly appointed.I then propos'd a lottery to defray the expense of buildinga battery below the town, and furnishing it with cannon.It filled expeditiously, and the battery was soon erected, the merlonsbeing fram'd of logs and fill'd with earth.  We bought some oldcannon from Boston, but, these not being sufficient, we wrote toEngland for more, soliciting, at the same time, our proprietariesfor some assistance, tho' without much expectation of obtaining it.Meanwhile, Colonel Lawrence, William Allen, Abram Taylor,Esqr., and myself were sent to New York by the associators,commission'd to borrow some cannon of Governor Clinton.  He at firstrefus'd us peremptorily; but at dinner with his council, where therewas great drinking of Madeira wine, as the custom of that placethen was, he softened by degrees, and said he would lend us six.After a few more bumpers he advanc'd to ten; and at length hevery good-naturedly conceded eighteen.  They were fine cannon,eighteen-pounders, with their carriages, which we soon transportedand mounted on our battery, where the associators kept a nightlyguard while the war lasted, and among the rest I regularly tookmy turn of duty there as a common soldier.My activity in these operations was agreeable to the governor and council;they took me into confidence, and I was consulted by them in everymeasure wherein their concurrence was thought useful to the association.Calling in the aid of religion, I propos'd to them the proclaiminga fast, to promote reformation, and implore the blessing of Heaven onour undertaking.  They embrac'd the motion; but, as it was the firstfast ever thought of in the province, the secretary had no precedentfrom which to draw the proclamation.  My education in New England,where a fast is proclaimed every year, was here of some advantage:I drew it in the accustomed stile, it was translated into German,printed in both languages, and divulg'd thro' the province.  This gavethe clergy of the different sects an opportunity of influencing theircongregations to join in the association, and it would probably havebeen general among all but Quakers if the peace had not soon interven'd.It was thought by some of my friends that, by my activity inthese affairs, I should offend that sect, and thereby lose my interestin the Assembly of the province, where they formed a great majority.A young gentleman who had likewise some friends in the House,and wished to succeed me as their clerk, acquainted me that itwas decided to displace me at the next election; and he, therefore,in good will, advis'd me to resign, as more consistent with my honourthan being turn'd out.  My answer to him was, that I had read or heardof some public man who made it a rule never to ask for an office,and never to refuse one when offer'd to him.  'I approve,'says I, 'of his rule, and will practice it with a small addition;I shall never ask, never refuse, nor ever resign an office.If they will have my office of clerk to dispose of to another,they shall take it from me.  I will not, by giving it up, lose myright of some time or other making reprisals on my adversaries.'I heard, however, no more of this; I was chosen again unanimouslyas usual at the next election.  Possibly, as they dislik'd my lateintimacy with the members of council, who had join'd the governorsin all the disputes about military preparations, with which the Househad long been harass'd, they might have been pleas'd if I wouldvoluntarily have left them; but they did not care to displace meon account merely of my zeal for the association, and they couldnot well give another reason.Indeed I had some cause to believe that the defense of the countrywas not disagreeable to any of them, provided they were not requir'dto assist in it.  And I found that a much greater number of themthan I could have imagined, tho' against offensive war, were clearlyfor the defensive.  Many pamphlets pro and con were publish'don the subject, and some by good Quakers, in favour of defense,which I believe convinc'd most of their younger people.A transaction in our fire company gave me some insight into theirprevailing sentiments.  It had been propos'd that we should encouragethe scheme for building a battery by laying out the present stock,then about sixty pounds, in tickets of the lottery.  By our rules,no money could be dispos'd of till the next meeting after the proposal.The company consisted of thirty members, of which twenty-twowere Quakers, and eight only of other persuasions.  We eightpunctually attended the meeting; but, tho' we thought that some ofthe Quakers would join us, we were by no means sure of a majority.Only one Quaker, Mr. James Morris, appear'd to oppose the measure.He expressed much sorrow that it had ever been propos'd, as he saidFriends were all against it, and it would create such discord as mightbreak up the company.  We told him that we saw no reason for that;we were the minority, and if Friends were against the measure,and outvoted us, we must and should, agreeably to the usageof all societies, submit.  When the hour for business arriv'dit was mov'd to put the vote; he allow'd we might then do itby the rules, but, as he could assure us that a number of membersintended to be present for the purpose of opposing it, it wouldbe but candid to allow a little time for their appearing.While we were disputing this, a waiter came to tell me two gentlemenbelow desir'd to speak with me.  I went down, and found they were twoof our Quaker members.  They told me there were eight of them assembledat a tavern just by; that they were determin'd to come and vote with usif there should be occasion, which they hop'd would not be the case,and desir'd we would not call for their assistance if we could dowithout it, as their voting for such a measure might embroil themwith their elders and friends.  Being thus secure of a majority,I went up, and after a little seeming hesitation, agreed to a delayof another hour.  This Mr. Morris allow'd to be extreamly fair.Not one of his opposing friends appear'd, at which he express'dgreat surprize; and, at the expiration of the hour, we carry'dthe resolution eight to one; and as, of the twenty-two Quakers,eight were ready to vote with us, and thirteen, by their absence,manifested that they were not inclin'd to oppose the measure,I afterward estimated the proportion of Quakers sincerely againstdefense as one to twenty-one only; for these were all regular membersof that society, and in good reputation among them, and had duenotice of what was propos'd at that meeting.The honorable and learned Mr. Logan, who had always been of that sect,was one who wrote an address to them, declaring his approbation ofdefensive war, and supporting his opinion by many strong arguments.He put into my hands sixty pounds to be laid out in lottery ticketsfor the battery, with directions to apply what prizes might be drawnwholly to that service.  He told me the following anecdote of hisold master, William Penn, respecting defense.  He came over from England,when a young man, with that proprietary, and as his secretary.It was war-time, and their ship was chas'd by an armed vessel,suppos'd to be an enemy.  Their captain prepar'd for defense;but told William Penn and his company of Quakers, that he didnot expect their assistance, and they might retire into the cabin,which they did, except James Logan, who chose to stay upon deck,and was quarter'd to a gun.  The suppos'd enemy prov'd a friend,so there was no fighting; but when the secretary went down tocommunicate the intelligence, William Penn rebuk'd him severely forstaying upon deck, and undertaking to assist in defending the vessel,contrary to the principles of Friends, especially as it had not beenrequired by the captain.  This reproof, being before all the company,piqu'd the secretary, who answer'd, 'I being thy servant, why didthee not order me to come down?  But thee was willing enough that Ishould stay and help to fight the ship when thee thought therewas danger.'My being many years in the Assembly, the majority of which wereconstantly Quakers, gave me frequent opportunities of seeingthe embarrassment given them by their principle against war,whenever application was made to them, by order of the crown,to grant aids for military purposes.  They were unwilling to offendgovernment, on the one hand, by a direct refusal; and their friends,the body of the Quakers, on the other, by a compliance contraryto their principles; hence a variety of evasions to avoid complying,and modes of disguising the compliance when it became unavoidable.The common mode at last was, to grant money under the phrase of itsbeing 'for the king's use,' and never to inquire how it was applied.But, if the demand was not directly from the crown, that phrase wasfound not so proper, and some other was to be invented.  As, when powderwas wanting (I think it was for the garrison at Louisburg), and thegovernment of New England solicited a grant of some from Pennsilvania,which was much urg'd on the House by Governor Thomas, they couldnot grant money to buy powder, because that was an ingredient of war;but they voted an aid to New England of three thousand pounds,to he put into the hands of the governor, and appropriated itfor the purchasing of bread, flour, wheat, or other grain.  Some ofthe council, desirous of giving the House still further embarrassment,advis'd the governor not to accept provision, as not being the thinghe had demanded; but be reply'd, 'I shall take the money, for Iunderstand very well their meaning; other grain is gunpowder,'which he accordingly bought, and they never objected to it.<10>     <10> See the votes.--[Marg. note.]It was in allusion to this fact that, when in our fire company wefeared the success of our proposal in favour of the lottery, and Ihad said to my friend Mr. Syng, one of our members, 'If we fail,let us move the purchase of a fire-engine with the money; the Quakerscan have no objection to that; and then, if you nominate me and Iyou as a committee for that purpose, we will buy a great gun,which is certainly a fire-engine.' 'I see,' says he, 'you haveimprov'd by being so long in the Assembly; your equivocal projectwould be just a match for their wheat or other grain.'These embarrassments that the Quakers suffer'd from havingestablish'd and published it as one of their principles thatno kind of war was lawful, and which, being once published,they could not afterwards, however they might change their minds,easily get rid of, reminds me of what I think a more prudentconduct in another sect among us, that of the Dunkers.  I wasacquainted with one of its founders, Michael Welfare, soon after itappear'd. He complain'd to me that they were grievously calumniatedby the zealots of other persuasions, and charg'd with abominableprinciples and practices, to which they were utter strangers.I told him this had always been the case with new sects, and that,to put a stop to such abuse, I imagin'd it might be well to publishthe articles of their belief, and the rules of their discipline.He said that it had been propos'd among them, but not agreed to,for this reason:  'When we were first drawn together as a society,'says he, 'it had pleased God to enlighten our minds so far as to seethat some doctrines, which we once esteemed truths, were errors;and that others, which we had esteemed errors, were real truths.From time to time He has been pleased to afford us farther light,and our principles have been improving, and our errors diminishing.Now we are not sure that we are arrived at the end of this progression,and at the perfection of spiritual or theological knowledge;and we fear that, if we should once print our confession of faith,we should feel ourselves as if bound and confin'd by it, and perhapsbe unwilling to receive farther improvement, and our successors stillmore so, as conceiving what we their elders and founders had done, to besomething sacred, never to be departed from.'This modesty in a sect is perhaps a singular instance in the historyof mankind, every other sect supposing itself in possessionof all truth, and that those who differ are so far in the wrong;like a man traveling in foggy weather, those at some distancebefore him on the road he sees wrapped up in the fog, as well asthose behind him, and also the people in the fields on each side,but near him all appears clear, tho' in truth he is as muchin the fog as any of them.  To avoid this kind of embarrassment,the Quakers have of late years been gradually declining the publicservice in the Assembly and in the magistracy, choosing ratherto quit their power than their principle.In order of time, I should have mentioned before, that having, in 1742,invented an open stove for the better warming of rooms, and at the sametime saving fuel, as the fresh air admitted was warmed in entering,I made a present of the model to Mr. Robert Grace, one of my earlyfriends, who, having an iron-furnace, found the casting of the platesfor these stoves a profitable thing, as they were growing in demand.To promote that demand, I wrote and published a pamphlet, entitled 'AnAccount of the new-invented Pennsylvania Fireplaces; wherein theirConstruction and Manner of Operation is particularly explained;their Advantages above every other Method of warming Rooms demonstrated;and all Objections that have been raised against the Use of themanswered and obviated,' etc.  This pamphlet had a good effect.Gov'r. Thomas was so pleas'd with the construction of this stove,as described in it, that he offered to give me a patent for the solevending of them for a term of years; but I declin'd it from a principlewhich has ever weighed with me on such occasions, viz., That, as weenjoy great advantages from the inventions of others, we should beglad of an opportunity to serve others by any invention of ours;and this we should do freely and generously.An ironmonger in London however, assuming a good deal of my pamphlet,and working it up into his own, and making some small changesin the machine, which rather hurt its operation, got a patentfor it there, and made, as I was told, a little fortune by it.And this is not the only instance of patents taken out for myinventions by others, tho' not always with the same success, which Inever contested, as having no desire of profiting by patents myself,and hating disputes.  The use of these fireplaces in very many houses,both of this and the neighbouring colonies, has been, and is,a great saving of wood to the inhabitants.Peace being concluded, and the association business therefore atan end, I turn'd my thoughts again to the affair of establishingan academy.  The first step I took was to associate in the designa number of active friends, of whom the Junto furnished a good part;the next was to write and publish a pamphlet, entitled ProposalsRelating to the Education of Youth in Pennsylvania.  This Idistributed among the principal inhabitants gratis; and as soonas I could suppose their minds a little prepared by the perusalof it, I set on foot a subscription for opening and supportingan academy; it was to be paid in quotas yearly for five years;by so dividing it, I judg'd the subscription might be larger,and I believe it was so, amounting to no less, if I remember right,than five thousand pounds.In the introduction to these proposals, I stated their publication,not as an act of mine, but of some publick-spirited gentlemen,avoiding as much as I could, according to my usual rule, the presentingmyself to the publick as the author of any scheme for their benefit.The subscribers, to carry the project into immediate execution,chose out of their number twenty-four trustees, and appointedMr. Francis, then attorney-general, and myself to draw up constitutionsfor the government of the academy; which being done and signed,a house was hired, masters engag'd, and the schools opened, I think,in the same year, 1749.The scholars increasing fast, the house was soon found too small,and we were looking out for a piece of ground, properly situated,with intention to build, when Providence threw into our way a largehouse ready built, which, with a few alterations, might wellserve our purpose.  This was the building before mentioned,erected by the hearers of Mr. Whitefield, and was obtained for usin the following manner.It is to be noted that the contributions to this building beingmade by people of different sects, care was taken in the nominationof trustees, in whom the building and ground was to be vested,that a predominancy should not be given to any sect, lest in time thatpredominancy might be a means of appropriating the whole to the useof such sect, contrary to the original intention.  It was thereforethat one of each sect was appointed, viz., one Church-of-England man,one Presbyterian, one Baptist, one Moravian, etc., those, in caseof vacancy by death, were to fill it by election from amongthe contributors.  The Moravian happen'd not to please his colleagues,and on his death they resolved to have no other of that sect.The difficulty then was, how to avoid having two of some other sect,by means of the new choice.Several persons were named, and for that reason not agreed to.At length one mention'd me, with the observation that I was merelyan honest man, and of no sect at all, which prevail'd with themto chuse me.  The enthusiasm which existed when the house was builthad long since abated, and its trustees had not been able to procurefresh contributions for paying the ground-rent, and dischargingsome other debts the building had occasion'd, which embarrass'dthem greatly.  Being now a member of both sets of trustees,that for the building and that for the Academy, I had a goodopportunity of negotiating with both, and brought them finallyto an agreement, by which the trustees for the building were to cedeit to those of the academy, the latter undertaking to dischargethe debt, to keep for ever open in the building a large hallfor occasional preachers, according to the original intention,and maintain a free school for the instruction of poor children.Writings were accordingly drawn, and on paying the debts thetrustees of the academy were put in possession of the premises;and by dividing the great and lofty hall into stories, and differentrooms above and below for the several schools, and purchasing someadditional ground, the whole was soon made fit for our purpose,and the scholars remov'd into the building.  The care and troubleof agreeing with the workmen, purchasing materials, and superintendingthe work, fell upon me; and I went thro' it the more cheerfully,as it did not then interfere with my private business, having theyear before taken a very able, industrious, and honest partner,Mr. David Hall, with whose character I was well acquainted, as hehad work'd for me four years.  He took off my hands all care ofthe printing-office, paying me punctually my share of the profits.This partnership continued eighteen years, successfully for us both.The trustees of the academy, after a while, were incorporatedby a charter from the governor; their funds were increas'd bycontributions in Britain and grants of land from the proprietaries,to which the Assembly has since made considerable addition;and thus was established the present University of Philadelphia.I have been continued one of its trustees from the beginning,now near forty years, and have had the very great pleasure of seeinga number of the youth who have receiv'd their education in it,distinguish'd by their improv'd abilities, serviceable in publicstations and ornaments to their country.When I disengaged myself, as above mentioned, from private business,I flatter'd myself that, by the sufficient tho' moderate fortuneI had acquir'd, I had secured leisure during the rest of my lifefor philosophical studies and amusements.  I purchased allDr. Spence's apparatus, who had come from England to lecture here,and I proceeded in my electrical experiments with great alacrity;but the publick, now considering me as a man of leisure, laid holdof me for their purposes, every part of our civil government,and almost at the same time, imposing some duty upon me.The governor put me into the commission of the peace; the corporationof the city chose me of the common council, and soon after an alderman;and the citizens at large chose me a burgess to represent themin Assembly.  This latter station was the more agreeable to me,as I was at length tired with sitting there to hear debates,in which, as clerk, I could take no part, and which were oftenso unentertaining that I was induc'd to amuse myself with makingmagic squares or circles, or any thing to avoid weariness; and Iconceiv'd my becoming a member would enlarge my power of doing good.I would not, however, insinuate that my ambition was not flatter'd by allthese promotions; it certainly was; for, considering my low beginning,they were great things to me; and they were still more pleasing,as being so many spontaneous testimonies of the public good opinion,and by me entirely unsolicited.The office of justice of the peace I try'd a little, by attendinga few courts, and sitting on the bench to hear causes; but findingthat more knowledge of the common law than I possess'd was necessaryto act in that station with credit, I gradually withdrew from it,excusing myself by my being oblig'd to attend the higher dutiesof a legislator in the Assembly.  My election to this trust wasrepeated every year for ten years, without my ever asking anyelector for his vote, or signifying, either directly or indirectly,any desire of being chosen.  On taking my seat in the House,my son was appointed their clerk.The year following, a treaty being to be held with the Indiansat Carlisle, the governor sent a message to the House, proposing thatthey should nominate some of their members, to be join'd with somemembers of council, as commissioners for that purpose.<11> The Housenamed the speaker (Mr. Norris) and myself; and, being commission'd,we went to Carlisle, and met the Indians accordingly.     <11> See the votes to have this more correctly.          --[Marg. note.]As those people are extreamly apt to get drunk, and, when so,are very quarrelsome and disorderly, we strictly forbad the sellingany liquor to them; and when they complain'd of this restriction,we told them that if they would continue sober during the treaty,we would give them plenty of rum when business was over.They promis'd this, and they kept their promise, because they could getno liquor, and the treaty was conducted very orderly, and concludedto mutual satisfaction.  They then claim'd and receiv'd the rum; this wasin the afternoon; they were near one hundred men, women, and children,and were lodg'd in temporary cabins, built in the form of a square,just without the town.  In the evening, hearing a great noiseamong them, the commissioners walk'd out to see what was the matter.We found they had made a great bonfire in the middle of the square;they were all drunk, men and women, quarreling and fighting.Their dark-colour'd bodies, half naked, seen only by the gloomy lightof the bonfire, running after and beating one another with firebrands,accompanied by their horrid yellings, form'd a scene the mostresembling our ideas of hell that could well be imagin'd; there wasno appeasing the tumult, and we retired to our lodging.  At midnighta number of them came thundering at our door, demanding more rum,of which we took no notice.The next day, sensible they had misbehav'd in giving us that disturbance,they sent three of their old counselors to make their apology.The orator acknowledg'd the fault, but laid it upon the rum;and then endeavored to excuse the rum by saying, 'The Great Spirit,who made all things, made every thing for some use, and whatever usehe design'd any thing for, that use it should always be put to.Now, when he made rum, he said 'Let this be for the Indians to getdrunk with,' and it must be so.'  And, indeed, if it be the designof Providence to extirpate these savages in order to make roomfor cultivators of the earth, it seems not improbable that rum maybe the appointed means.  It has already annihilated all the tribeswho formerly inhabited the sea-coast.In 1751, Dr. Thomas Bond, a particular friend of mine, conceived the ideaof establishing a hospital in Philadelphia (a very beneficent design,which has been ascrib'd to me, but was originally his), for the receptionand cure of poor sick persons, whether inhabitants of the provinceor strangers.  He was zealous and active in endeavouring to procuresubscriptions for it, but the proposal being a novelty in America,and at first not well understood, he met with but small success.At length he came to me with the compliment that he found therewas no such thing as carrying a public-spirited project throughwithout my being concern'd in it.  'For,' says he, 'I am oftenask'd by those to whom I propose subscribing, Have you consulted
ENTP	 upon this business?  And what does he think of it?And when I tell them that I have not (supposing it rather out of yourline), they do not subscribe, but say they will consider of it.'I enquired into the nature and probable utility of his scheme,and receiving from him a very satisfactory explanation, I not onlysubscrib'd to it myself, but engag'd heartily in the design of procuringsubscriptions from others.  Previously, however, to the solicitation,I endeavoured to prepare the minds of the people by writing on thesubject in the newspapers, which was my usual custom in such cases,but which he had omitted.The subscriptions afterwards were more free and generous;but, beginning to flag, I saw they would be insufficient withoutsome assistance from the Assembly, and therefore propos'd topetition for it, which was done.  The country members did not atfirst relish the project; they objected that it could only beserviceable to the city, and therefore the citizens alone shouldbe at the expense of it; and they doubted whether the citizensthemselves generally approv'd of it.  My allegation on the contrary,that it met with such approbation as to leave no doubt of ourbeing able to raise two thousand pounds by voluntary donations,they considered as a most extravagant supposition, and utterly impossible.On this I form'd my plan; and asking leave to bring in a bill forincorporating the contributors according to the prayer of their petition,and granting them a blank sum of money, which leave was obtainedchiefly on the consideration that the House could throw the bill outif they did not like it, I drew it so as to make the important clausea conditional one, viz., 'And be it enacted, by the authority aforesaid,that when the said contributors shall have met and chosen theirmanagers and treasurer, and shall have raised by their contributionsa capital stock of ----- value (the yearly interest of which is to beapplied to the accommodating of the sick poor in the said hospital,free of charge for diet, attendance, advice, and medicines), andshall make the same appear to the satisfaction of the speaker ofthe Assembly for the time being, that then it shall and may be lawfulfor the said speaker, and he is hereby required, to sign an orderon the provincial treasurer for the payment of two thousand pounds,in two yearly payments, to the treasurer of the said hospital,to be applied to the founding, building, and finishing of the same.'This condition carried the bill through; for the members, who hadoppos'd the grant, and now conceiv'd they might have the creditof being charitable without the expence, agreed to its passage;and then, in soliciting subscriptions among the people, we urg'dthe conditional promise of the law as an additional motive to give,since every man's donation would be doubled; thus the clausework'd both ways.  The subscriptions accordingly soon exceededthe requisite sum, and we claim'd and receiv'd the public gift,which enabled us to carry the design into execution.  A convenientand handsome building was soon erected; the institution hasby constant experience been found useful, and flourishes tothis day; and I do not remember any of my political manoeuvres,the success of which gave me at the time more pleasure, or wherein,after thinking of it, I more easily excus'd myself for having madesome use of cunning.It was about this time that another projector, the Rev. Gilbert Tennent,came to me with a request that I would assist him in procuringa subscription for erecting a new meeting-house. It was to be forthe use of a congregation he had gathered among the Presbyterians,who were originally disciples of Mr. Whitefield.  Unwilling tomake myself disagreeable to my fellow-citizens by too frequentlysoliciting their contributions, I absolutely refus'd. He thendesired I would furnish him with a list of the names of persons Iknew by experience to be generous and public-spirited. I thoughtit would be unbecoming in me, after their kind compliance withmy solicitations, to mark them out to be worried by other beggars,and therefore refus'd also to give such a list.  He then desir'd Iwould at least give him my advice.  'That I will readily do,' said I;'and, in the first place, I advise you to apply to all those whomyou know will give something; next, to those whom you are uncertainwhether they will give any thing or not, and show them the listof those who have given; and, lastly, do not neglect those who youare sure will give nothing, for in some of them you may be mistaken.'He laugh'd and thank'd me, and said he would take my advice.He did so, for he ask'd of everybody, and he obtained a muchlarger sum than he expected, with which he erected the capaciousand very elegant meeting-house that stands in Arch-street.Our city, tho' laid out with a beautiful regularity, the streets large,strait, and crossing each other at right angles, had the disgraceof suffering those streets to remain long unpav'd, and in wetweather the wheels of heavy carriages plough'd them into a quagmire,so that it was difficult to cross them; and in dry weather the dustwas offensive.  I had liv'd near what was call'd the Jersey Market,and saw with pain the inhabitants wading in mud while purchasingtheir provisions.  A strip of ground down the middle of thatmarket was at length pav'd with brick, so that, being oncein the market, they had firm footing, but were often over shoesin dirt to get there.  By talking and writing on the subject,I was at length instrumental in getting the street pav'd with stonebetween the market and the brick'd foot-pavement, that was on eachside next the houses.  This, for some time, gave an easy accessto the market dry-shod; but, the rest of the street not beingpav'd, whenever a carriage came out of the mud upon this pavement,it shook off and left its dirt upon it, and it was soon cover'dwith mire, which was not remov'd, the city as yet having no scavengers.After some inquiry I found a poor industrious man, who was willingto undertake keeping the pavement clean, by sweeping it twicea week, carrying off the dirt from before all the neighbours'doors, for the sum of sixpence per month, to be paid by each house.I then wrote and printed a paper setting forth the advantagesto the neighbourhood that might be obtain'd by this small expense;the greater ease in keeping our houses clean, so much dirt not beingbrought in by people's feet; the benefit to the shops by more custom,etc., etc., as buyers could more easily get at them; and by not having,in windy weather, the dust blown in upon their goods, etc., etc.I sent one of these papers to each house, and in a day or two wentround to see who would subscribe an agreement to pay these sixpences;it was unanimously sign'd, and for a time well executed.All the inhabitants of the city were delighted with the cleanlinessof the pavement that surrounded the market, it being a convenienceto all, and this rais'd a general desire to have all the streets paved,and made the people more willing to submit to a tax for that purpose.After some time I drew a bill for paving the city, and brought itinto the Assembly.  It was just before I went to England, in 1757,and did not pass till I was gone.<12> and then with an alterationin the mode of assessment, which I thought not for the better,but with an additional provision for lighting as well as pavingthe streets, which was a great improvement.  It was by a private person,the late Mr. John Clifton, his giving a sample of the utility of lamps,by placing one at his door, that the people were first impress'dwith the idea of enlighting all the city.  The honour of thispublic benefit has also been ascrib'd to me but it belongs trulyto that gentleman.  I did but follow his example, and have onlysome merit to claim respecting the form of our lamps, as differingfrom the globe lamps we were at first supply'd with from London.Those we found inconvenient in these respects:  they admittedno air below; the smoke, therefore, did not readily go out above,but circulated in the globe, lodg'd on its inside, and soonobstructed the light they were intended to afford; giving, besides,the daily trouble of wiping them clean; and an accidental strokeon one of them would demolish it, and render it totally useless.I therefore suggested the composing them of four flat panes,with a long funnel above to draw up the smoke, and crevicesadmitting air below, to facilitate the ascent of the smoke; by thismeans they were kept clean, and did not grow dark in a few hours,as the London lamps do, but continu'd bright till morning,and an accidental stroke would generally break but a single pane,easily repair'd.     <12> See votes.I have sometimes wonder'd that the Londoners did not, from theeffect holes in the bottom of the globe lamps us'd at Vauxhallhave in keeping them clean, learn to have such holes in theirstreet lamps.  But, these holes being made for another purpose,viz., to communicate flame more suddenly to the wick by a littleflax hanging down thro' them, the other use, of letting in air,seems not to have been thought of; and therefore, after the lamps havebeen lit a few hours, the streets of London are very poorly illuminated.The mention of these improvements puts me in mind of one I propos'd, whenin London, to Dr. Fothergill, who was among the best men I have known,and a great promoter of useful projects.  I had observ'd that the streets,when dry, were never swept, and the light dust carried away;but it was suffer'd to accumulate till wet weather reduc'd it to mud,and then, after lying some days so deep on the pavement that therewas no crossing but in paths kept clean by poor people with brooms,it was with great labour rak'd together and thrown up into cartsopen above, the sides of which suffer'd some of the slush at everyjolt on the pavement to shake out and fall, sometimes to the annoyanceof foot-passengers. The reason given for not sweeping the dustystreets was, that the dust would fly into the windows of shops and houses.An accidental occurrence had instructed me how much sweeping mightbe done in a little time.  I found at my door in Craven-street,one morning, a poor woman sweeping my pavement with a birch broom;she appeared very pale and feeble, as just come out of a fitof sickness.  I ask'd who employ'd her to sweep there; she said,'Nobody, but I am very poor and in distress, and I sweeps beforegentlefolkses doors, and hopes they will give me something.'  I bidher sweep the whole street clean, and I would give her a shilling;this was at nine o'clock; at 12 she came for the shilling.From the slowness I saw at first in her working, I could scarce believethat the work was done so soon, and sent my servant to examine it,who reported that the whole street was swept perfectly clean,and all the dust plac'd in the gutter, which was in the middle;and the next rain wash'd it quite away, so that the pavement and eventhe kennel were perfectly clean.I then judg'd that, if that feeble woman could sweep such a street inthree hours, a strong, active man might have done it in half the time.And here let me remark the convenience of having but one gutterin such a narrow street, running down its middle, instead of two,one on each side, near the footway; for where all the rain thatfalls on a street runs from the sides and meets in the middle,it forms there a current strong enough to wash away all the mud itmeets with; but when divided into two channels, it is often too weakto cleanse either, and only makes the mud it finds more fluid,so that the wheels of carriages and feet of horses throw and dash itupon the foot-pavement, which is thereby rendered foul and slippery,and sometimes splash it upon those who are walking.  My proposal,communicated to the good doctor, was as follows:'For the more effectual cleaning and keeping clean the streets ofLondon and Westminster, it is proposed that the several watchmen becontracted with to have the dust swept up in dry seasons, and the mudrak'd up at other times, each in the several streets and lanesof his round; that they be furnish'd with brooms and other properinstruments for these purposes, to be kept at their respective stands,ready to furnish the poor people they may employ in the service.'That in the dry summer months the dust be all swept up into heapsat proper distances, before the shops and windows of houses areusually opened, when the scavengers, with close-covered carts,shall also carry it all away.'That the mud, when rak'd up, be not left in heaps to be spreadabroad again by the wheels of carriages and trampling of horses,but that the scavengers be provided with bodies of carts, not plac'dhigh upon wheels, but low upon sliders, with lattice bottoms, which,being cover'd with straw, will retain the mud thrown into them,and permit the water to drain from it, whereby it will becomemuch lighter, water making the greatest part of its weight;these bodies of carts to be plac'd at convenient distances, and themud brought to them in wheel-barrows; they remaining where plac'dtill the mud is drain'd, and then horses brought to draw them away.'I have since had doubts of the practicability of the latter partof this proposal, on account of the narrowness of some streets,and the difficulty of placing the draining-sleds so as not to encumbertoo much the passage; but I am still of opinion that the former,requiring the dust to be swept up and carry'd away before the shopsare open, is very practicable in the summer, when the days are long;for, in walking thro' the Strand and Fleet-street one morning atseven o'clock, I observ'd there was not one shop open, tho' it hadbeen daylight and the sun up above three hours; the inhabitantsof London chusing voluntarily to live much by candle-light,and sleep by sunshine, and yet often complain, a little absurdly,of the duty on candles and the high price of tallow.Some may think these trifling matters not worth minding or relating;but when they consider that tho' dust blown into the eyesof a single person, or into a single shop on a windy day,is but of small importance, yet the great number of the instancesin a populous city, and its frequent repetitions give it weightand consequence, perhaps they will not censure very severely thosewho bestow some attention to affairs of this seemingly low nature.Human felicity is produc'd not so much by great pieces of goodfortune that seldom happen, as by little advantages that occurevery day.  Thus, if you teach a poor young man to shave himself,and keep his razor in order, you may contribute more to the happinessof his life than in giving him a thousand guineas.  The money may besoon spent, the regret only remaining of having foolishly consumed it;but in the other case, he escapes the frequent vexation of waitingfor barbers, and of their sometimes dirty fingers, offensive breaths,and dull razors; he shaves when most convenient to him, and enjoysdaily the pleasure of its being done with a good instrument.With these sentiments I have hazarded the few preceding pages,hoping they may afford hints which some time or other may be usefulto a city I love, having lived many years in it very happily,and perhaps to some of our towns in America.Having been for some time employed by the postmaster-generalof America as his comptroller in regulating several offices,and bringing the officers to account, I was, upon his deathin 1753, appointed, jointly with Mr. William Hunter, to succeed him,by a commission from the postmaster-general in England.  The Americanoffice never had hitherto paid any thing to that of Britain.We were to have six hundred pounds a year between us, if we could makethat sum out of the profits of the office.  To do this, a varietyof improvements were necessary; some of these were inevitably atfirst expensive, so that in the first four years the office becameabove nine hundred pounds in debt to us.  But it soon after beganto repay us; and before I was displac'd by a freak of the ministers,of which I shall speak hereafter, we had brought it to yield three timesas much clear revenue to the crown as the postoffice of Ireland.Since that imprudent transaction, they have receiv'd from it--not one farthing!The business of the postoffice occasion'd my taking a journey thisyear to New England, where the College of Cambridge, of theirown motion, presented me with the degree of Master of Arts.Yale College, in Connecticut, had before made me a similar compliment.Thus, without studying in any college, I came to partakeof their honours.  They were conferr'd in consideration of myimprovements and discoveries in the electric branch of natural philosophy.In 1754, war with France being again apprehended, a congressof commissioners from the different colonies was, by an orderof the Lords of Trade, to be assembled at Albany, there to conferwith the chiefs of the Six Nations concerning the means of defendingboth their country and ours.  Governor Hamilton, having receiv'dthis order, acquainted the House with it, requesting they wouldfurnish proper presents for the Indians, to be given on this occasion;and naming the speaker (Mr. Norris) and myself to join Mr. Thomas Pennand Mr. Secretary Peters as commissioners to act for Pennsylvania.The House approv'd the nomination, and provided the goods for the present,and tho' they did not much like treating out of the provinces;and we met the other commissioners at Albany about the middle of June.In our way thither, I projected and drew a plan for the unionof all the colonies under one government, so far as might benecessary for defense, and other important general purposes.As we pass'd thro' New York, I had there shown my project to Mr. JamesAlexander and Mr. Kennedy, two gentlemen of great knowledgein public affairs, and, being fortified by their approbation,I ventur'd to lay it before the Congress.  It then appeared thatseveral of the commissioners had form'd plans of the same kind.A previous question was first taken, whether a union shouldbe established, which pass'd in the affirmative unanimously.A committee was then appointed, one member from each colony,to consider the several plans and report.  Mine happen'dto be preferr'd, and, with a few amendments, was accordingly reported.By this plan the general government was to be administered by apresident-general, appointed and supported by the crown, and a grandcouncil was to be chosen by the representatives of the peopleof the several colonies, met in their respective assemblies.The debates upon it in Congress went on daily, hand in hand withthe Indian business.  Many objections and difficulties were started,but at length they were all overcome, and the plan was unanimouslyagreed to, and copies ordered to be transmitted to the Boardof Trade and to the assemblies of the several provinces.Its fate was singular:  the assemblies did not adopt it, as theyall thought there was too much prerogative in it, and in Englandit was judg'd to have too much of the democratic.The Board of Trade therefore did not approve of it, nor recommend itfor the approbation of his majesty; but another scheme was form'd,supposed to answer the same purpose better, whereby the governorsof the provinces, with some members of their respective councils,were to meet and order the raising of troops, building of forts,etc., and to draw on the treasury of Great Britain for the expense,which was afterwards to be refunded by an act of Parliament layinga tax on America.  My plan, with my reasons in support of it,is to be found among my political papers that are printed.Being the winter following in Boston, I had much conversation withGovernor Shirley upon both the plans.  Part of what passed between uson the occasion may also be seen among those papers.  The differentand contrary reasons of dislike to my plan makes me suspect that itwas really the true medium; and I am still of opinion it wouldhave been happy for both sides the water if it had been adopted.The colonies, so united, would have been sufficiently strong to havedefended themselves; there would then have been no need of troopsfrom England; of course, the subsequent pretence for taxing America,and the bloody contest it occasioned, would have been avoided.But such mistakes are not new; history is full of the errors of statesand princes.          Look round the habitable world, how few          Know their own good, or, knowing it, pursue!Those who govern, having much business on their hands, do notgenerally like to take the trouble of considering and carrying intoexecution new projects.  The best public measures are thereforeseldom adopted from previous wisdom, but forc'd by the occasion.The Governor of Pennsylvania, in sending it down to the Assembly,express'd his approbation of the plan, 'as appearing to himto be drawn up with great clearness and strength of judgment,and therefore recommended it as well worthy of their closest andmost serious attention.'  The House, however, by the managementof a certain member, took it up when I happen'd to be absent,which I thought not very fair, and reprobated it without payingany attention to it at all, to my no small mortification.In my journey to Boston this year, I met at New York with ournew governor, Mr. Morris, just arriv'd there from England, with whomI had been before intimately acquainted.  He brought a commissionto supersede Mr. Hamilton, who, tir'd with the disputes his proprietaryinstructions subjected him to, had resign'd. Mr. Morris ask'd meif I thought he must expect as uncomfortable an administration.I said, 'No; you may, on the contrary, have a very comfortable one,if you will only take care not to enter into any dispute withthe Assembly.'  'My dear friend,' says he, pleasantly, 'how canyou advise my avoiding disputes?  You know I love disputing;it is one of my greatest pleasures; however, to show the regardI have for your counsel, I promise you I will, if possible,avoid them.'  He had some reason for loving to dispute, being eloquent,an acute sophister, and, therefore, generally successful inargumentative conversation.  He had been brought up to it from a boy,his father, as I have heard, accustoming his children to dispute withone another for his diversion, while sitting at table after dinner;but I think the practice was not wise; for, in the course ofmy observation, these disputing, contradicting, and confuting peopleare generally unfortunate in their affairs.  They get victory sometimes,but they never get good will, which would be of more use to them.We parted, he going to Philadelphia, and I to Boston.In returning, I met at New York with the votes of the Assembly,by which it appear'd that, notwithstanding his promise to me,he and the House were already in high contention; and it was acontinual battle between them as long as he retain'd the government.I had my share of it; for, as soon as I got back to my seat inthe Assembly, I was put on every committee for answering his speechesand messages, and by the committees always desired to make the drafts.Our answers, as well as his messages, were often tart, and sometimesindecently abusive; and, as he knew I wrote for the Assembly,one might have imagined that, when we met, we could hardly avoidcutting throats; but he was so good-natur'd a man that no personaldifference between him and me was occasion'd by the contest, and weoften din'd together.One afternoon, in the height of this public quarrel, we met inthe street.  '
ENTP	,' says he, 'you must go home with me and spendthe evening; I am to have some company that you will like;' and,taking me by the arm, he led me to his house.  In gay conversationover our wine, after supper, he told us, jokingly, that he muchadmir'd the idea of Sancho Panza, who, when it was proposed to givehim a government, requested it might be a government of blacks,as then, if he could not agree with his people, he might sell them.One of his friends, who sat next to me, says, ', whydo you continue to side with these damn'd Quakers?  Had not youbetter sell them?  The proprietor would give you a good price.''The governor,' says I, 'has not yet blacked them enough.'He, indeed, had labored hard to blacken the Assembly in allhis messages, but they wip'd off his coloring as fast as helaid it on, and plac'd it, in return, thick upon his own face;so that, finding he was likely to be negrofied himself, he, as wellas Mr. Hamilton, grew tir'd of the contest, and quitted the government.<13>These public quarrels were all at bottom owing to the proprietaries,our hereditary governors, who, when any expense was to be incurredfor the defense of their province, with incredible meanness instructedtheir deputies to pass no act for levying the necessary taxes,unless their vast estates were in the same act expressly excused;and they had even taken bonds of these deputies to observesuch instructions.  The Assemblies for three years held out againstthis injustice, tho' constrained to bend at last.  At lengthCaptain Denny, who was Governor Morris's successor, ventured to disobeythose instructions; how that was brought about I shall show hereafter.     <13> My acts in Morris's time, military, etc.--[Marg. note.]But I am got forward too fast with my story:  there are still sometransactions to be mention'd that happened during the administrationof Governor Morris.War being in a manner commenced with France, the government ofMassachusetts Bay projected an attack upon Crown Point, and sentMr. Quincy to Pennsylvania, and Mr. Pownall, afterward Governor Pownall,to New York, to solicit assistance.  As I was in the Assembly,knew its temper, and was Mr. Quincy's countryman, he appli'd to mefor my influence and assistance.  I dictated his address to them,which was well receiv'd. They voted an aid of ten thousand pounds,to be laid out in provisions.  But the governor refusing hisassent to their bill (which included this with other sums grantedfor the use of the crown), unless a clause were inserted exemptingthe proprietary estate from bearing any part of the tax that wouldbe necessary, the Assembly, tho' very desirous of making their grantto New England effectual, were at a loss how to accomplish it.Mr. Quincy labored hard with the governor to obtain his assent,but he was obstinate.I then suggested a method of doing the business without the governor,by orders on the trustees of the Loan Office, which, by law,the Assembly had the right of drawing.  There was, indeed, little orno money at that time in the office, and therefore I propos'd thatthe orders should be payable in a year, and to bear an interestof five per cent.  With these orders I suppos'd the provisions mighteasily be purchas'd. The Assembly, with very little hesitation,adopted the proposal.  The orders were immediately printed, and Iwas one of the committee directed to sign and dispose of them.The fund for paying them was the interest of all the paper currencythen extant in the province upon loan, together with the revenuearising from the excise, which being known to be more than sufficient,they obtain'd instant credit, and were not only receiv'd in paymentfor the provisions, but many money'd people, who had cash lying by them,vested it in those orders, which they found advantageous, as they boreinterest while upon hand, and might on any occasion be used as money;so that they were eagerly all bought up, and in a few weeks none of themwere to be seen.  Thus this important affair was by my means compleated.My Quincy return'd thanks to the Assembly in a handsome memorial,went home highly pleas'd with the success of his embassy, and everafter bore for me the most cordial and affectionate friendship.The British government, not chusing to permit the union of the coloniesas propos'd at Albany, and to trust that union with their defense,lest they should thereby grow too military, and feel their own strength,suspicions and jealousies at this time being entertain'd of them,sent over General Braddock with two regiments of regular Englishtroops for that purpose.  He landed at Alexandria, in Virginia,and thence march'd to Frederictown, in Maryland, where he haltedfor carriages.  Our Assembly apprehending, from some information,that he had conceived violent prejudices against them, as averseto the service, wish'd me to wait upon him, not as from them,but as postmaster-general, under the guise of proposing to settlewith him the mode of conducting with most celerity and certaintythe despatches between him and the governors of the several provinces,with whom he must necessarily have continual correspondence, and ofwhich they propos'd to pay the expense.  My son accompanied me onthis journey.We found the general at Frederictown, waiting impatiently forthe return of those he had sent thro' the back parts of Marylandand Virginia to collect waggons.  I stayed with him several days,din'd with him daily, and had full opportunity of removingall his prejudices, by the information of what the Assembly hadbefore his arrival actually done, and were still willing to do,to facilitate his operations.  When I was about to depart, the returnsof waggons to be obtained were brought in, by which it appear'dthat they amounted only to twenty-five, and not all of those werein serviceable condition.  The general and all the officers weresurpris'd, declar'd the expedition was then at an end, being impossible,and exclaim'd against the ministers for ignorantly landing them in acountry destitute of the means of conveying their stores, baggage,etc., not less than one hundred and fifty waggons being necessary.I happened to say I thought it was a pity they had not been landedrather in Pennsylvania, as in that country almost every farmer hadhis waggon.  The general eagerly laid hold of my words, and said,'Then you, sir, who are a man of interest there, can probablyprocure them for us; and I beg you will undertake it.'  I ask'dwhat terms were to be offer'd the owners of the waggons; and I wasdesir'd to put on paper the terms that appeared to me necessary.This I did, and they were agreed to, and a commission and instructionsaccordingly prepar'd immediately.  What those terms were will appearin the advertisement I publish'd as soon as I arriv'd at Lancaster,which being, from the great and sudden effect it produc'd, a pieceof some curiosity, I shall insert it at length, as follows:               'ADVERTISEMENT.                        'LANCASTER, April 26, 1755.'Whereas, one hundred and fifty waggons, with four horses to each waggon,and fifteen hundred saddle or pack horses, are wanted for the serviceof his majesty's forces now about to rendezvous at Will's Creek,and his excellency General Braddock having been pleased to empowerme to contract for the hire of the same, I hereby give noticethat I shall attend for that purpose at Lancaster from this dayto next Wednesday evening, and at York from next Thursday morningtill Friday evening, where I shall be ready to agree for waggonsand teams, or single horses, on the following terms, viz.: I. Thatthere shall be paid for each waggon, with four good horses anda driver, fifteen shillings per diem; and for each able horsewith a pack-saddle, or other saddle and furniture, two shillingsper diem; and for each able horse without a saddle, eighteen penceper diem.  2.  That the pay commence from the time of their joiningthe forces at Will's Creek, which must be on or before the 20thof May ensuing, and that a reasonable allowance be paid over andabove for the time necessary for their travelling to Will's Creekand home again after their discharge.  3.  Each waggon and team,and every saddle or pack horse, is to be valued by indifferentpersons chosen between me and the owner; and in case of the loss ofany waggon, team, or other horse in the service, the price accordingto such valuation is to be allowed and paid.  4.  Seven days'pay is to be advanced and paid in hand by me to the owner of eachwaggon and team, or horse, at the time of contracting, if required,and the remainder to be paid by General Braddock, or by the paymasterof the army, at the time of their discharge, or from time to time,as it shall be demanded.  5.  No drivers of waggons, or personstaking care of the hired horses, are on any account to be calledupon to do the duty of soldiers, or be otherwise employed than inconducting or taking care of their carriages or horses.  6.  All oats,Indian corn, or other forage that waggons or horses bring to the camp,more than is necessary for the subsistence of the horses, is to betaken for the use of the army, and a reasonable price paid for the same.'Note.--My son, William 
ENTP	, is empowered to enter into likecontracts with any person in Cumberland county.                                        'B. FRANKLIN.'     'To the inhabitants of the Counties of Lancaster,                    York and Cumberland.'Friends and Countrymen,'Being occasionally at the camp at Frederic a few days since,I found the general and officers extremely exasperated on accountof their not being supplied with horses and carriages, which hadbeen expected from this province, as most able to furnish them;but, through the dissensions between our governor and Assembly,money had not been provided, nor any steps taken for that purpose.'It was proposed to send an armed force immediately into these counties,to seize as many of the best carriages and horses as should be wanted,and compel as many persons into the service as would be necessaryto drive and take care of them.'I apprehended that the progress of British soldiers through thesecounties on such an occasion, especially considering the temperthey are in, and their resentment against us, would be attendedwith many and great inconveniences to the inhabitants, and thereforemore willingly took the trouble of trying first what might be doneby fair and equitable means.  The people of these back countieshave lately complained to the Assembly that a sufficient currencywas wanting; you have an opportunity of receiving and dividingamong you a very considerable sum; for, if the service of thisexpedition should continue, as it is more than probable it will,for one hundred and twenty days, the hire of these waggonsand horses will amount to upward of thirty thousand pounds,which will be paid you in silver and gold of the king's money.'The service will be light and easy, for the army will scarce marchabove twelve miles per day, and the waggons and baggage-horses, asthey carry those things that are absolutely necessary to the welfareof the army, must march with the army, and no faster; and are,for the army's sake, always placed where they can be most secure,whether in a march or in a camp.'If you are really, as I believe you are, good and loyal subjectsto his majesty, you may now do a most acceptable service, and make iteasy to yourselves; for three or four of such as can not separatelyspare from the business of their plantations a waggon and fourhorses and a driver, may do it together, one furnishing the waggon,another one or two horses, and another the driver, and divide the payproportionately between you; but if you do not this service to yourking and country voluntarily, when such good pay and reasonableterms are offered to you, your loyalty will be strongly suspected.The king's business must be done; so many brave troops, come so farfor your defense, must not stand idle through your backwardnessto do what may be reasonably expected from you; waggons and horsesmust be had; violent measures will probably be used, and youwill be left to seek for a recompense where you can find it,and your case, perhaps, be little pitied or regarded.'I have no particular interest in this affair, as, except thesatisfaction of endeavoring to do good, I shall have only my labourfor my pains.  If this method of obtaining the waggons and horsesis not likely to succeed, I am obliged to send word to the generalin fourteen days; and I suppose Sir John St. Clair, the hussar,with a body of soldiers, will immediately enter the provincefor the purpose, which I shall be sorry to hear, because Iam very sincerely and truly your friend and well-wisher, B. FRANKLIN.'I received of the general about eight hundred pounds, to bedisbursed in advance-money to the waggon owners, etc.; but, that sumbeing insufficient, I advanc'd upward of two hundred pounds more,and in two weeks the one hundred and fifty waggons, with two hundredand fifty-nine carrying horses, were on their march for the camp.The advertisement promised payment according to the valuation,in case any waggon or horse should be lost.  The owners, however,alleging they did not know General Braddock, or what dependencemight be had on his promise, insisted on my bond for the performance,which I accordingly gave them.While I was at the camp, supping one evening with the officersof Colonel Dunbar's regiment, he represented to me his concernfor the subalterns, who, he said, were generally not in affluence,and could ill afford, in this dear country, to lay in the storesthat might be necessary in so long a march, thro' a wilderness,where nothing was to be purchas'd. I commiserated their case,and resolved to endeavor procuring them some relief.  I said nothing,however, to him of my intention, but wrote the next morning to thecommittee of the Assembly, who had the disposition of some public money,warmly recommending the case of these officers to their consideration,and proposing that a present should be sent them of necessariesand refreshments.  My son, who had some experience of a camp life,and of its wants, drew up a list for me, which I enclos'd in my letter.The committee approv'd, and used such diligence that, conducted bymy son, the stores arrived at the camp as soon as the waggons.They consisted of twenty parcels, each containing6 lbs. loaf sugar.                1 Gloucester cheese.6 lbs. good Muscovado do.         1 kegg containing 20 lbs. good1 lb. good green tea.             butter.1 lb. good bohea do.              2 doz. old Madeira wine.6 lbs. good ground coffee.        2 gallons Jamaica spirits.6 lbs. chocolate.                 1 bottle flour of mustard.1-2 cwt. best white biscuit.      2 well-cur'd hams.1-2 lb. pepper.                   1-2 dozen dry'd tongues.1 quart best white wine vinegar   6 lbs. rice.                                  6 lbs. raisins.These twenty parcels, well pack'd, were placed on as many horses,each parcel, with the horse, being intended as a present forone officer.  They were very thankfully receiv'd, and the kindnessacknowledg'd by letters to me from the colonels of both regiments,in the most grateful terms.  The general, too, was highly satisfiedwith my conduct in procuring him the waggons, etc., and readilypaid my account of disbursements, thanking me repeatedly,and requesting my farther assistance in sending provisions after him.I undertook this also, and was busily employ'd in it till we heardof his defeat, advancing for the service of my own money, upwards ofone thousand pounds sterling, of which I sent him an account.It came to his hands, luckily for me, a few days before the battle,and he return'd me immediately an order on the paymaster for the roundsum of one thousand pounds, leaving the remainder to the next account.I consider this payment as good luck, having never been ableto obtain that remainder, of which more hereafter.This general was, I think, a brave man, and might probably havemade a figure as a good officer in some European war.  But he hadtoo much self-confidence, too high an opinion of the validity ofregular troops, and too mean a one of both Americans and Indians.George Croghan, our Indian interpreter, join'd him on his marchwith one hundred of those people, who might have been of great useto his army as guides, scouts, etc., if he had treated them kindly;but he slighted and neglected them, and they gradually left him.In conversation with him one day, he was giving me some accountof his intended progress.  'After taking Fort Duquesne,' says he,'I am to proceed to Niagara; and, having taken that, to Frontenac,if the season will allow time; and I suppose it will, for Duquesnecan hardly detain me above three or four days; and then I see nothingthat can obstruct my march to Niagara.'  Having before revolv'din my mind the long line his army must make in their march by avery narrow road, to be cut for them thro' the woods and bushes,and also what I had read of a former defeat of fifteen hundred French,who invaded the Iroquois country, I had conceiv'd some doubts and somefears for the event of the campaign.  But I ventur'd only to say,'To be sure, sir, if you arrive well before Duquesne, with thesefine troops, so well provided with artillery, that place not yetcompleatly fortified, and as we hear with no very strong garrison,can probably make but a short resistance.  The only danger I apprehendof obstruction to your march is from ambuscades of Indians, who,by constant practice, are dexterous in laying and executing them;and the slender line, near four miles long, which your army must make,may expose it to be attack'd by surprise in its flanks, and to becut like a thread into several pieces, which, from their distance,can not come up in time to support each other.'He smil'd at my ignorance, and reply'd, 'These savages may, indeed,be a formidable enemy to your raw American militia, but uponthe king's regular and disciplin'd troops, sir, it is impossiblethey should make any impression.'  I was conscious of an improprietyin my disputing with a military man in matters of his profession,and said no more.  The enemy, however, did not take the advantageof his army which I apprehended its long line of march expos'd it to,but let it advance without interruption till within nine milesof the place; and then, when more in a body (for it had just passeda river, where the front had halted till all were come over), andin a more open part of the woods than any it had pass'd, attack'dits advanced guard by a heavy fire from behind trees and bushes,which was the first intelligence the general had of an enemy'sbeing near him.  This guard being disordered, the general hurriedthe troops up to their assistance, which was done in great confusion,thro' waggons, baggage, and cattle; and presently the fire came upontheir flank:  the officers, being on horseback, were more easilydistinguish'd, pick'd out as marks, and fell very fast; and the soldierswere crowded together in a huddle, having or hearing no orders,and standing to be shot at till two-thirds of them were killed;and then, being seiz'd with a panick, the whole fled with precipitation.The waggoners took each a horse out of his team and scamper'd;their example was immediately followed by others; so that allthe waggons, provisions, artillery, and stores were left to the enemy.The general, being wounded, was brought off with difficulty;his secretary, Mr. Shirley, was killed by his side; and outof eighty-six officers, sixty-three were killed or wounded,and seven hundred and fourteen men killed out of eleven hundred.These eleven hundred had been picked men from the whole army;the rest had been left behind with Colonel Dunbar, who was to followwith the heavier part of the stores, provisions, and baggage.The flyers, not being pursu'd, arriv'd at Dunbar's camp,and the panick they brought with them instantly seiz'd himand all his people; and, tho' he had now above one thousand men,and the enemy who had beaten Braddock did not at most exceedfour hundred Indians and French together, instead of proceeding,and endeavoring to recover some of the lost honour, he orderedall the stores, ammunition, etc., to be destroy'd, that he mighthave more horses to assist his flight towards the settlements,and less lumber to remove.  He was there met with requests fromthe governors of Virginia, Maryland, and Pennsylvania, that he wouldpost his troops on the frontiers, so as to afford some protectionto the inhabitants; but he continu'd his hasty march thro'all the country, not thinking himself safe till he arriv'dat Philadelphia, where the inhabitants could protect him.  This wholetransaction gave us Americans the first suspicion that our exaltedideas of the prowess of British regulars had not been well founded.In their first march, too, from their landing till they got beyondthe settlements, they had plundered and stripped the inhabitants,totally ruining some poor families, besides insulting, abusing,and confining the people if they remonstrated.  This was enoughto put us out of conceit of such defenders, if we had reallywanted any.  How different was the conduct of our French friendsin 1781, who, during a march thro' the most inhabited part of ourcountry from Rhode Island to Virginia, near seven hundred miles,occasioned not the smallest complaint for the loss of a pig,a chicken, or even an apple.Captain Orme, who was one of the general's aids-de-camp, and,being grievously wounded, was brought off with him, and continu'dwith him to his death, which happen'd in a few days, told me thathe was totally silent all the first day, and at night only said,'Who would have thought it?'  That he was silent again the following day,saying only at last, 'We shall better know how to deal with themanother time;' and dy'd in a few minutes after.The secretary's papers, with all the general's orders,instructions, and correspondence, falling into the enemy's hands,they selected and translated into French a number of the articles,which they printed, to prove the hostile intentions of the Britishcourt before the declaration of war.  Among these I saw some lettersof the general to the ministry, speaking highly of the great serviceI had rendered the army, and recommending me to their notice.David Hume, too, who was some years after secretary to Lord Hertford,when minister in France, and afterward to General Conway, when secretaryof state, told me he had seen among the papers in that office,letters from Braddock highly recommending me.  But, the expeditionhaving been unfortunate, my service, it seems, was not thoughtof much value, for those recommendations were never of any use to me.As to rewards from himself, I ask'd only one, which was, that he wouldgive orders to his officers not to enlist any more of our bought servants,and that he would discharge such as had been already enlisted.This he readily granted, and several were accordingly return'dto their masters, on my application.  Dunbar, when the commanddevolv'd on him, was not so generous.  He being at Philadelphia,on his retreat, or rather flight, I apply'd to him for the dischargeof the servants of three poor farmers of Lancaster county that hehad enlisted, reminding him of the late general's orders on that bead.He promised me that, if the masters would come to him at Trenton,where he should be in a few days on his march to New York,he would there deliver their men to them.  They accordingly were atthe expense and trouble of going to Trenton, and there he refus'dto perform his promise, to their great loss and disappointment.As soon as the loss of the waggons and horses was generally known,all the owners came upon me for the valuation which I had given bondto pay.  Their demands gave me a great deal of trouble, my acquaintingthem that the money was ready in the paymaster's hands, but thatorders for paying it must first be obtained from General Shirley,and my assuring them that I had apply'd to that general by letter;but, he being at a distance, an answer could not soon be receiv'd,and they must have patience, all this was not sufficient to satisfy,and some began to sue me.  General Shirley at length relieved mefrom this terrible situation by appointing commissioners to examinethe claims, and ordering payment.  They amounted to near twentythousand pound, which to pay would have ruined me.Before we had the news of this defeat, the two Doctors Bond cameto me with a subscription paper for raising money to defraythe expense of a grand firework, which it was intended to exhibitat a rejoicing on receipt of the news of our taking Fort Duquesne.I looked grave, and said it would, I thought, be time enoughto prepare for the rejoicing when we knew we should have occasionto rejoice.  They seem'd surpris'd that I did not immediatelycomply with their proposal.  'Why the d--l!' says one of them,'you surely don't suppose that the fort will not be taken?''I don't know that it will not be taken, but I know that the eventsof war are subject to great uncertainty.'  I gave them the reasonsof my doubting; the subscription was dropt, and the projectors therebymissed the mortification they would have undergone if the fireworkhad been prepared.  Dr. Bond, on some other occasion afterward,said that he did not like 
ENTP	's forebodings.Governor Morris, who had continually worried the Assembly with messageafter message before the defeat of Braddock, to beat them intothe making of acts to raise money for the defense of the province,without taxing, among others, the proprietary estates, and hadrejected all their bills for not having such an exempting clause,now redoubled his attacks with more hope of success, the dangerand necessity being greater.  The Assembly, however, continu'd firm,believing they had justice on their side, and that it wouldbe giving up an essential right if they suffered the governorto amend their money-bills. In one of the last, indeed, which wasfor granting fifty thousand pounds, his propos'd amendment wasonly of a single word.  The bill expressed 'that all estates,real and personal, were to be taxed, those of the proprietariesnot excepted.'  His amendment was, for not read only:  a small,but very material alteration.  However, when the news of thisdisaster reached England, our friends there, whom we had taken careto furnish with all the Assembly's answers to the governor's messages,rais'd a clamor against the proprietaries for their meanness andinjustice in giving their governor such instructions; some goingso far as to say that, by obstructing the defense of their province,they forfeited their right to it.  They were intimidated by this,and sent orders to their receiver-general to add five thousandpounds of their money to whatever sum might be given by the Assemblyfor such purpose.This, being notified to the House, was accepted in lieu of their shareof a general tax, and a new bill was form'd, with an exempting clause,which passed accordingly.  By this act I was appointed one of thecommissioners for disposing of the money, sixty thousand pounds.I had been active in modelling the bill and procuring its passage,and had, at the same time, drawn a bill for establishingand disciplining of a voluntary militia, which I carried thro'the House without much difficulty, as care was taken in it toleave the Quakers at their liberty.  To promote the associationnecessary to form the militia, I wrote a dialogue,<14> statingand answering all the objections I could think of to such a militia,which was printed, and had, as I thought, great effect.     <14> This dialogue and the militia act are in the          'Gentleman's Magazine' for February and March, 1756.           --[Marg. note.]While the several companies in the city and country were formingand learning their exercise, the governor prevail'd with me to takecharge of our North-western frontier, which was infested by the enemy,and provide for the defense of the inhabitants by raising troops andbuilding a line of forts.  I undertook this military business, tho' I didnot conceive myself well qualified for it.  He gave me a commissionwith full powers, and a parcel of blank commissions for officers,to be given to whom I thought fit.  I had but little difficultyin raising men, having soon five hundred and sixty under my command.My son, who had in the preceding war been an officer in the armyrais'd against Canada, was my aid-de-camp, and of great use to me.The Indians had burned Gnadenhut, a village settled by the Moravians,and massacred the inhabitants; but the place was thought a goodsituation for one of the forts.In order to march thither, I assembled the companies at Bethlehem,the chief establishment of those people.  I was surprised to findit in so good a posture of defense; the destruction of Gnadenhuthad made them apprehend danger.  The principal buildings weredefended by a stockade; they had purchased a quantity of arms andammunition from New York, and had even plac'd quantities of smallpaving stones between the windows of their high stone houses,for their women to throw down upon the heads of any Indiansthat should attempt to force into them.  The armed brethren, too,kept watch, and reliev'd as methodically as in any garrison town.In conversation with the bishop, Spangenberg, I mention'd thismy surprise; for, knowing they had obtained an act of Parliamentexempting them from military duties in the colonies, I hadsuppos'd they were conscientiously scrupulous of bearing arms.He answer'd me that it was not one of their established principles,but that, at the time of their obtaining that act, it was thoughtto be a principle with many of their people.  On this occasion,however, they, to their surprise, found it adopted by but a few.It seems they were either deceiv'd in themselves, or deceiv'dthe Parliament; but common sense, aided by present danger,will sometimes be too strong for whimsical opinions.It was the beginning of January when we set out upon this businessof building forts.  I sent one detachment toward the Minisink,with instructions to erect one for the security of that upper part ofthe country, and another to the lower part, with similar instructions;and I concluded to go myself with the rest of my force to Gnadenhut,where a fort was tho't more immediately necessary.  The Moraviansprocur'd me five waggons for our tools, stores, baggage, etc.Just before we left Bethlehem, eleven farmers, who had been drivenfrom their plantations by the Indians, came to me requesting a supplyof firearms, that they might go back and fetch off their cattle.I gave them each a gun with suitable ammunition.  We had not march'dmany miles before it began to rain, and it continued raining all day;there were no habitations on the road to shelter us, till we arriv'dnear night at the house of a German, where, and in his barn,we were all huddled together, as wet as water could make us.It was well we were not attack'd in our march, for our arms were ofthe most ordinary sort, and our men could not keep their gun locks dry.The Indians are dextrous in contrivances for that purpose, which wehad not.  They met that day the eleven poor farmers above mentioned,and killed ten of them.  The one who escap'd inform'd that his andhis companions' guns would not go off, the priming being wet withthe rain.The next day being fair, we continu'd our march, and arriv'd atthe desolated Gnadenhut.  There was a saw-mill near, round which wereleft several piles of boards, with which we soon hutted ourselves;an operation the more necessary at that inclement season, as wehad no tents.  Our first work was to bury more effectually the deadwe found there, who had been half interr'd by the country people.The next morning our fort was plann'd and mark'd out, the circumferencemeasuring four hundred and fifty-five feet, which would requireas many palisades to be made of trees, one with another,of a foot diameter each.  Our axes, of which we had seventy,were immediately set to work to cut down trees, and, our menbeing dextrous in the use of them, great despatch was made.Seeing the trees fall so fast, I had the curiosity to look at my watchwhen two men began to cut at a pine; in six minutes they had it uponthe ground, and I found it of fourteen inches diameter.  Each pinemade three palisades of eighteen feet long, pointed at one end.While these were preparing, our other men dug a trench all round,of three feet deep, in which the palisades were to be planted;and, our waggons, the bodys being taken off, and the fore and hindwheels separated by taking out the pin which united the two partsof the perch, we had ten carriages, with two horses each, to bringthe palisades from the woods to the spot.  When they were set up,our carpenters built a stage of boards all round within, about sixfeet high, for the men to stand on when to fire thro' the loopholes.We had one swivel gun, which we mounted on one of the angles,and fir'd it as soon as fix'd, to let the Indians know, if anywere within hearing, that we had such pieces; and thus our fort,if such a magnificent name may be given to so miserable a stockade,was finish'd in a week, though it rain'd so hard every other daythat the men could not work.This gave me occasion to observe, that, when men are employ'd, theyare best content'd; for on the days they worked they were good-natur'dand cheerful, and, with the consciousness of having done a goodday's work, they spent the evening jollily; but on our idle daysthey were mutinous and quarrelsome, finding fault with their pork,the bread, etc., and in continual ill-humor, which put me in mindof a sea-captain, whose rule it was to keep his men constantlyat work; and, when his mate once told him that they had doneevery thing, and there was nothing further to employ them about,'Oh,' says he, 'Make them scour the anchor.'This kind of fort, however contemptible, is a sufficient defenseagainst Indians, who have no cannon.  Finding ourselves now postedsecurely, and having a place to retreat to on occasion, we ventur'dout in parties to scour the adjacent country.  We met with no Indians,but we found the places on the neighboring hills where they had lainto watch our proceedings.  There was an art in their contrivanceof those places, that seems worth mention.  It being winter, a firewas necessary for them; but a common fire on the surface of the groundwould by its light have discovered their position at a distance.They had therefore dug holes in the ground about three feet diameter,and somewhat deeper; we saw where they had with their hatchets cutoff the charcoal from the sides of burnt logs lying in the woods.With these coals they had made small fires in the bottom ofthe holes, and we observ'd among the weeds and grass the printsof their bodies, made by their laying all round, with their legshanging down in the holes to keep their feet warm, which, with them,is an essential point.  This kind of fire, so manag'd, could notdiscover them, either by its light, flame, sparks, or even smoke:it appear'd that their number was not great, and it seems they sawwe were too many to be attacked by them with prospect of advantage.We had for our chaplain a zealous Presbyterian minister, Mr. Beatty,who complained to me that the men did not generally attend his prayersand exhortations.  When they enlisted, they were promised, besides payand provisions, a gill of rum a day, which was punctually serv'dout to them, half in the morning, and the other half in the evening;and I observ'd they were as punctual in attending to receive it;upon which I said to Mr. Beatty, 'It is, perhaps, below the dignityof your profession to act as steward of the rum, but if you were to dealit out and only just after prayers, you would have them all about you.'He liked the tho't, undertook the office, and, with the help of afew hands to measure out the liquor, executed it to satisfaction,and never were prayers more generally and more punctually attended;so that I thought this method preferable to the punishment inflictedby some military laws for non-attendance on divine service.I had hardly finish'd this business, and got my fort well stor'dwith provisions, when I receiv'd a letter from the governor,acquainting me that he had call'd the Assembly, and wished myattendance there, if the posture of affairs on the frontierswas such that my remaining there was no longer necessary.My friends, too, of the Assembly, pressing me by their letters to be,if possible, at the meeting, and my three intended forts beingnow compleated, and the inhabitants contented to remain on their farmsunder that protection, I resolved to return; the more willingly,as a New England officer, Colonel Clapham, experienced in Indian war,being on a visit to our establishment, consented to accept the command.I gave him a commission, and, parading the garrison, had itread before them, and introduc'd him to them as an officer who,from his skill in military affairs, was much more fit to command themthan myself; and, giving them a little exhortation, took my leave.I was escorted as far as Bethlehem, where I rested a few days torecover from the fatigue I had undergone.  The first night, being ina good bed, I could hardly sleep, it was so different from my hardlodging on the floor of our hut at Gnaden wrapt only in a blanket or two.While at Bethlehem, I inquir'd a little into the practice ofthe Moravians:  some of them had accompanied me, and all were verykind to me.  I found they work'd for a common stock, eat at commontables, and slept in common dormitories, great numbers together.In the dormitories I observed loopholes, at certain distances allalong just under the ceiling, which I thought judiciously placedfor change of air.  I was at their church, where I was entertain'dwith good musick, the organ being accompanied with violins, hautboys,flutes, clarinets, etc.  I understood that their sermons were notusually preached to mixed congregations of men, women, and children,as is our common practice, but that they assembled sometimesthe married men, at other times their wives, then the young men,the young women, and the little children, each division by itself.The sermon I heard was to the latter, who came in and were plac'd in rowson benches; the boys under the conduct of a young man, their tutor,and the girls conducted by a young woman.  The discourse seem'dwell adapted to their capacities, and was deliver'd in a pleasing,familiar manner, coaxing them, as it were, to be good.  They behav'dvery orderly, but looked pale and unhealthy, which made me suspectthey were kept too much within doors, or not allow'd sufficient exercise.I inquir'd concerning the Moravian marriages, whether the reportwas true that they were by lot.  I was told that lots were us'donly in particular cases; that generally, when a young man foundhimself dispos'd to marry, he inform'd the elders of his class,who consulted the elder ladies that govern'd the young women.As these elders of the different sexes were well acquaintedwith the tempers and dispositions of their respective pupils,they could best judge what matches were suitable, and their judgmentswere generally acquiesc'd in; but if, for example, it should happenthat two or three young women were found to be equally properfor the young man, the lot was then recurred to.  I objected,if the matches are not made by the mutual choice of the parties,some of them may chance to be very unhappy.  'And so they may,'answer'd my informer, 'if you let the parties chuse for themselves;'which, indeed, I could not deny.Being returned to Philadelphia, I found the association wenton swimmingly, the inhabitants that were not Quakers having prettygenerally come into it, formed themselves into companies, and chosetheir captains, lieutenants, and ensigns, according to the new law.Dr. B. visited me, and gave me an account of the pains he had takento spread a general good liking to the law, and ascribed much tothose endeavors.  I had had the vanity to ascribe all to my Dialogue;however, not knowing but that he might be in the right, I let him enjoyhis opinion, which I take to be generally the best way in such cases.The officers, meeting, chose me to be colonel of the regiment,which I this time accepted.  I forget how many companies we had,but we paraded about twelve hundred well-looking men, with a companyof artillery, who had been furnished with six brass field-pieces,which they had become so expert in the use of as to fire twelve timesin a minute.  The first time I reviewed my regiment they accompanied meto my house, and would salute me with some rounds fired before my door,which shook down and broke several glasses of my electrical apparatus.And my new honour proved not much less brittle; for all ourcommissions were soon after broken by a repeal of the law in England.During this short time of my colonelship, being about to set out ona journey to Virginia, the officers of my regiment took it into theirheads that it would be proper for them to escort me out of town,as far as the Lower Ferry.  Just as I was getting on horseback theycame to my door, between thirty and forty, mounted, and all intheir uniforms.  I had not been previously acquainted with the project,or I should have prevented it, being naturally averse to the assumingof state on any occasion; and I was a good deal chagrin'd attheir appearance, as I could not avoid their accompanying me.What made it worse was, that, as soon as we began to move,they drew their swords and rode with them naked all the way.Somebody wrote an account of this to the proprietor, and it gave himgreat offense.  No such honor had been paid him when in the province,nor to any of his governors; and he said it was only proper toprinces of the blood royal, which may be true for aught I know,who was, and still am, ignorant of the etiquette in such cases.This silly affair, however, greatly increased his rancour against me,which was before not a little, on account of my conduct in theAssembly respecting the exemption of his estate from taxation,which I had always oppos'd very warmly, and not without severereflections on his meanness and injustice of contending for it.He accused me to the ministry as being the great obstacle tothe king's service, preventing, by my influence in the House,the proper form of the bills for raising money, and he instancedthis parade with my officers as a proof of my having an intentionto take the government of the province out of his hands by force.He also applied to Sir Everard Fawkener, the postmaster-general,to deprive me of my office; but it had no other effect than to procurefrom Sir Everard a gentle admonition.Notwithstanding the continual wrangle between the governorand the House, in which I, as a member, had so large a share,there still subsisted a civil intercourse between that gentlemanand myself, and we never had any personal difference.  I havesometimes since thought that his little or no resentment against me,for the answers it was known I drew up to his messages, might bethe effect of professional habit, and that, being bred a lawyer,he might consider us both as merely advocates for contending clientsin a suit, he for the proprietaries and I for the Assembly.He would, therefore, sometimes call in a friendly way to advisewith me on difficult points, and sometimes, tho' not often,take my advice.We acted in concert to supply Braddock's army with provisions;and, when the shocking news arrived of his defeat, the governor sentin haste for me, to consult with him on measures for preventingthe desertion of the back counties.  I forget now the adviceI gave; but I think it was, that Dunbar should be written to,and prevail'd with, if possible, to post his troops on the frontiersfor their protection, till, by re-enforcements from the colonies,he might be able to proceed on the expedition.  And, after my returnfrom the frontier, he would have had me undertake the conductof such an expedition with provincial troops, for the reductionof Fort Duquesne, Dunbar and his men being otherwise employed; and heproposed to commission me as general.  I had not so good an opinionof my military abilities as he profess'd to have, and I believe hisprofessions must have exceeded his real sentiments; but probably hemight think that my popularity would facilitate the raising of the men,and my influence in Assembly, the grant of money to pay them,and that, perhaps, without taxing the proprietary estate.  Finding menot so forward to engage as he expected, the project was dropt,and he soon after left the government, being superseded by Captain Denny.Before I proceed in relating the part I had in public affairs underthis new governor's administration, it may not be amiss here to givesome account of the rise and progress of my philosophical reputation.In 1746, being at Boston, I met there with a Dr. Spence, who was latelyarrived from Scotland, and show'd me some electric experiments.They were imperfectly perform'd, as he was not very expert; but, being ona subject quite new to me, they equally surpris'd and pleased me.Soon after my return to Philadelphia, our library company receiv'dfrom Mr. P. Collinson, Fellow of the Royal Society of London,a present of a glass tube, with some account of the use of itin making such experiments.  I eagerly seized the opportunityof repeating what I had seen at Boston; and, by much practice,acquir'd great readiness in performing those, also, which we hadan account of from England, adding a number of new ones.  I saymuch practice, for my house was continually full, for some time,with people who came to see these new wonders.To divide a little this incumbrance among my friends, I causeda number of similar tubes to be blown at our glass-house,with which they furnish'd themselves, so that we had at lengthseveral performers.  Among these, the principal was Mr. Kinnersley,an ingenious neighbor, who, being out of business, I encouragedto undertake showing the experiments for money, and drew up for himtwo lectures, in which the experiments were rang'd in such order,and accompanied with such explanations in such method, as thatthe foregoing should assist in comprehending the following.He procur'd an elegant apparatus for the purpose, in which allthe little machines that I had roughly made for myself were nicelyform'd by instrument-makers. His lectures were well attended,and gave great satisfaction; and after some time he went thro'the colonies, exhibiting them in every capital town, and pick'd upsome money.  In the West India islands, indeed, it was with difficultythe experiments could be made, from the general moisture of the air.Oblig'd as we were to Mr. Collinson for his present of the tube, etc., Ithought it right he should be inform'd of our success in using it,and wrote him several letters containing accounts of our experiments.He got them read in the Royal Society, where they were not at firstthought worth so much notice as to be printed in their Transactions.One paper, which I wrote for Mr. Kinnersley, on the sameness oflightning with electricity, I sent to Dr. Mitchel, an acquaintanceof mine, and one of the members also of that society, who wrote meword that it had been read, but was laughed at by the connoisseurs.The papers, however, being shown to Dr. Fothergill, he thought themof too much value to be stifled, and advis'd the printing of them.Mr. Collinson then gave them to Cave for publication in hisGentleman's Magazine; but he chose to print them separately ina pamphlet, and Dr. Fothergill wrote the preface.  Cave, it seems,judged rightly for his profit, for by the additions that arrivedafterward they swell'd to a quarto volume, which has had five editions,and cost him nothing for copy-money.It was, however, some time before those papers were much taken noticeof in England.  A copy of them happening to fall into the handsof the Count de Buffon, a philosopher deservedly of great reputationin France, and, indeed, all over Europe, he prevailed with M. Dalibardto translate them into French, and they were printed at Paris.The publication offended the Abbe Nollet, preceptor in Natural Philosophyto the royal family, and an able experimenter, who had form'd andpublish'd a theory of electricity, which then had the general vogue.He could not at first believe that such a work came from America,and said it must have been fabricated by his enemies at Paris, to decryhis system.  Afterwards, having been assur'd that there really existedsuch a person as 
ENTP	 at Philadelphia, which he had doubted,he wrote and published a volume of Letters, chiefly address'd to me,defending his theory, and denying the verity of my experiments,and of the positions deduc'd from them.I once purpos'd answering the abbe, and actually began the answer;but, on consideration that my writings contain'd a descriptionof experiments which any one might repeat and verify, and if notto be verifi'd, could not be defended; or of observations offer'das conjectures, and not delivered dogmatically, therefore notlaying me under any obligation to defend them; and reflectingthat a dispute between two persons, writing in different languages,might be lengthened greatly by mistranslations, and thencemisconceptions of one another's meaning, much of one of the abbe'sletters being founded on an error in the translation, I concludedto let my papers shift for themselves, believing it was betterto spend what time I could spare from public business in makingnew experiments, than in disputing about those already made.I therefore never answered M. Nollet, and the event gave me nocause to repent my silence; for my friend M. le Roy, of the RoyalAcademy of Sciences, took up my cause and refuted him; my bookwas translated into the Italian, German, and Latin languages;and the doctrine it contain'd was by degrees universally adoptedby the philosophers of Europe, in preference to that of the abbe;so that he lived to see himself the last of his sect, except MonsieurB----, of Paris, his eleve and immediate disciple.What gave my book the more sudden and general celebrity,was the success of one of its proposed experiments, made by Messrs.Dalibard and De Lor at Marly, for drawing lightning from the clouds.This engag'd the public attention every where.  M. de Lor,who had an apparatus for experimental philosophy, and lectur'din that branch of science, undertook to repeat what he calledthe Philadelphia Experiments; and, after they were performed beforethe king and court, all the curious of Paris flocked to see them.I will not swell this narrative with an account of that capitalexperiment, nor of the infinite pleasure I receiv'd in the successof a similar one I made soon after with a kite at Philadelphia,as both are to be found in the histories of electricity.Dr. Wright, an English physician, when at Paris, wrote to a friend,who was of the Royal Society, an account of the high esteem myexperiments were in among the learned abroad, and of their wonderthat my writings had been so little noticed in England.  The society,on this, resum'd the consideration of the letters that had been readto them; and the celebrated Dr. Watson drew up a summary accountof them, and of all I had afterwards sent to England on the subject,which be accompanied with some praise of the writer.  This summarywas then printed in their Transactions; and some members of the societyin London, particularly the very ingenious Mr. Canton, having verifiedthe experiment of procuring lightning from the clouds by a pointed rod,and acquainting them with the success, they soon made me more thanamends for the slight with which they had before treated me.Without my having made any application for that honor, they chose mea member, and voted that I should be excus'd the customary payments,which would have amounted to twenty-five guineas; and ever sincehave given me their Transactions gratis.  They also presentedme with the gold medal of Sir Godfrey Copley for the year 1753,the delivery of which was accompanied by a very handsome speechof the president, Lord Macclesfield, wherein I was highly honoured.Our new governor, Captain Denny, brought over for me the before-mentionedmedal from the Royal Society, which he presented to me at anentertainment given him by the city.  He accompanied it with verypolite expressions of his esteem for me, having, as he said, been longacquainted with my character.  After dinner, when the company,as was customary at that time, were engag'd in drinking, he tookme aside into another room, and acquainted me that he had beenadvis'd by his friends in England to cultivate a friendship with me,as one who was capable of giving him the best advice, and ofcontributing most effectually to the making his administration easy;that he therefore desired of all things to have a good understandingwith me, and he begg'd me to be assur'd of his readiness on alloccasions to render me every service that might be in his power.He said much to me, also, of the proprietor's good dispositiontowards the province, and of the advantage it might be to us all,and to me in particular, if the opposition that had been so longcontinu'd to his measures was dropt, and harmony restor'd betweenhim and the people; in effecting which, it was thought no one couldbe more serviceable than myself; and I might depend on adequateacknowledgments and recompenses, etc., etc.  The drinkers,finding we did not return immediately to the table, sent usa decanter of Madeira, which the governor made liberal use of,and in proportion became more profuse of his solicitations and promises.My answers were to this purpose:  that my circumstances, thanks to God,were such as to make proprietary favours unnecessary to me;and that, being a member of the Assembly, I could not possibly acceptof any; that, however, I had no personal enmity to the proprietary,and that, whenever the public measures he propos'd should appearto be for the good of the people, no one should espouse and forwardthem more zealously than myself; my past opposition having beenfounded on this, that the measures which had been urged were evidentlyintended to serve the proprietary interest, with great prejudiceto that of the people; that I was much obliged to him (the governor)for his professions of regard to me, and that he might rely on everything in my power to make his administration as easy as possible,hoping at the same time that he had not brought with him the sameunfortunate instruction his predecessor had been hamper'd with.On this he did not then explain himself; but when he afterwards cameto do business with the Assembly, they appear'd again, the disputeswere renewed, and I was as active as ever in the opposition,being the penman, first, of the request to have a communicationof the instructions, and then of the remarks upon them, which maybe found in the votes of the time, and in the Historical Review Iafterward publish'd. But between us personally no enmity arose;we were often together; he was a man of letters, had seen much ofthe world, and was very entertaining and pleasing in conversation.He gave me the first information that my old friend Jas.  Ralph wasstill alive; that he was esteem'd one of the best political writersin England; had been employ'd in the dispute between Prince Fredericand the king, and had obtain'd a pension of three hundred a year;that his reputation was indeed small as a poet, Pope having damnedhis poetry in the Dunciad; but his prose was thought as good as anyman's.<15>The Assembly finally finding the proprietary obstinately persistedin manacling their deputies with instructions inconsistent not onlywith the privileges of the people, but with the service of the crown,resolv'd to petition the king against them, and appointed me theiragent to go over to England, to present and support the petition.The House had sent up a bill to the governor, granting a sumof sixty thousand pounds for the king's use (ten thousand poundsof which was subjected to the orders of the then general,Lord Loudoun), which the governor absolutely refus'd to pass,in compliance with his instructions.     <15> The many unanimous resolves of the Assembly--          what date?-- [Marg. note.]I had agreed with Captain Morris, of the paquet at New York,for my passage, and my stores were put on board, when Lord Loudounarriv'd at Philadelphia, expressly, as he told me, to endeavoran accommodation between the governor and Assembly, that hismajesty's service might not be obstructed by their dissensions.Accordingly, he desir'd the governor and myself to meet him, that hemight hear what was to be said on both sides.  We met and discuss'dthe business.  In behalf of the Assembly, I urg'd all the variousarguments that may be found in the public papers of that time,which were of my writing, and are printed with the minutes ofthe Assembly; and the governor pleaded his instructions; the bond hehad given to observe them, and his ruin if he disobey'd, yet seemednot unwilling to hazard himself if Lord Loudoun would advise it.This his lordship did not chuse to do, though I once thought Ihad nearly prevail'd with him to do it; but finally he rather choseto urge the compliance of the Assembly; and he entreated me to usemy endeavours with them for that purpose, declaring that he wouldspare none of the king's troops for the defense of our frontiers,and that, if we did not continue to provide for that defense ourselves,they must remain expos'd to the enemy.I acquainted the House with what had pass'd, and, presenting themwith a set of resolutions I had drawn up, declaring our rights,and that we did not relinquish our claim to those rights, but onlysuspended the exercise of them on this occasion thro' force,against which we protested, they at length agreed to drop that bill,and frame another conformable to the proprietary instructions.This of course the governor pass'd, and I was then at libertyto proceed on my voyage.  But, in the meantime, the paquethad sailed with my sea-stores, which was some loss to me,and my only recompense was his lordship's thanks for my service,all the credit of obtaining the accommodation falling to his share.He set out for New York before me; and, as the time for dispatchingthe paquet-boats was at his disposition, and there were two thenremaining there, one of which, he said, was to sail very soon,I requested to know the precise time, that I might not miss herby any delay of mine.  His answer was, 'I have given out that sheis to sail on Saturday next; but I may let you know, entre nous,that if you are there by Monday morning, you will be in time,but do not delay longer.'  By some accidental hinderance at a ferry,it was Monday noon before I arrived, and I was much afraidshe might have sailed, as the wind was fair; but I was soonmade easy by the information that she was still in the harbor,and would not move till the next day.  One would imagine that Iwas now on the very point of departing for Europe.  I thought so;but I was not then so well acquainted with his lordship's character,of which indecision was one of the strongest features.  I shallgive some instances.  It was about the beginning of April that Icame to New York, and I think it was near the end of June beforewe sail'd. There were then two of the paquet-boats, which hadbeen long in port, but were detained for the general's letters,which were always to be ready to-morrow. Another paquet arriv'd;she too was detain'd; and, before we sail'd, a fourth was expected.Ours was the first to be dispatch'd, as having been there longest.Passengers were engag'd in all, and some extremely impatientto be gone, and the merchants uneasy about their letters,and the orders they had given for insurance (it being war time)for fall goods! but their anxiety avail'd nothing; his lordship'sletters were not ready; and yet whoever waited on him found himalways at his desk, pen in hand, and concluded he must needswrite abundantly.Going myself one morning to pay my respects, I found in his antechamberone Innis, a messenger of Philadelphia, who had come from thenceexpress with a paquet from Governor Denny for the General.He delivered to me some letters from my friends there, which occasion'dmy inquiring when he was to return, and where be lodg'd, that Imight send some letters by him.  He told me he was order'd to callto-morrow at nine for the general's answer to the governor, and shouldset off immediately.  I put my letters into his hands the same day.A fortnight after I met him again in the same place.  'So, youare soon return'd, Innis?'  'Returned! no, I am not gone yet.''How so?'  'I have called here by order every morning these twoweeks past for his lordship's letter, and it is not yet ready.''Is it possible, when he is so great a writer? for I see himconstantly at his escritoire.'  'Yes,' says Innis, 'but he is likeSt. George on the signs, always on horseback, and never rides on!'This observation of the messenger was, it seems, well founded; for,when in England, I understood that Mr. Pitt gave it as one reasonfor removing this general, and sending Generals Amherst and Wolfe,that the minister never heard from him, and could not know what hewas doing.This daily expectation of sailing, and all the three paquets goingdown to Sandy Hook, to join the fleet there, the passengers thoughtit best to be on board, lest by a sudden order the ships should sail,and they be left behind.  There, if I remember right, we were aboutsix weeks, consuming our sea-stores, and oblig'd to procure more.At length the fleet sail'd, the General and all his army on board,bound to Louisburg, with intent to besiege and take that fortress;all the paquet-boats in company ordered to attend the General's ship,ready to receive his dispatches when they should be ready.We were out five days before we got a letter with leave to part,and then our ship quitted the fleet and steered for England.  The othertwo paquets he still detained, carried them with him to Halifax,where he stayed some time to exercise the men in sham attacksupon sham forts, then alter'd his mind as to besieging Louisburg,and return'd to New York, with all his troops, together with the twopaquets above mentioned, and all their passengers!  During hisabsence the French and savages had taken Fort George, on the frontierof that province, and the savages had massacred many of the garrisonafter capitulation.I saw afterwards in London Captain Bonnell, who commanded oneof those paquets.  He told me that, when he had been detain'da month, he acquainted his lordship that his ship was grown foul,to a degree that must necessarily hinder her fast sailing, a pointof consequence for a paquet-boat, and requested an allowanceof time to heave her down and clean her bottom.  He was askedhow long time that would require.  He answer'd, three days.The general replied, 'If you can do it in one day, I give leave;otherwise not; for you must certainly sail the day after to-morrow.'So he never obtain'd leave, though detained afterwards from dayto day during full three months.I saw also in London one of Bonnell's passengers, who was so enrag'dagainst his lordship for deceiving and detaining him so longat New York, and then carrying him to Halifax and back again,that he swore he would sue for damages.  Whether he did or not,I never heard; but, as he represented the injury to his affairs,it was very considerable.On the whole, I wonder'd much how such a man came to be intrustedwith so important a business as the conduct of a great army;but, having since seen more of the great world, and the meansof obtaining, and motives for giving places, my wonder is diminished.General Shirley, on whom the command of the army devolved uponthe death of Braddock, would, in my opinion, if continued in place,have made a much better campaign than that of Loudoun in 1757,which was frivolous, expensive, and disgraceful to our nationbeyond conception; for, tho' Shirley was not a bred soldier, he wassensible and sagacious in himself, and attentive to good advicefrom others, capable of forming judicious plans, and quick and activein carrying them into execution.  Loudoun, instead of defendingthe colonies with his great army, left them totally expos'd whilehe paraded idly at Halifax, by which means Fort George was lost,besides, he derang'd all our mercantile operations, and distress'dour trade, by a long embargo on the exportation of provisions,on pretence of keeping supplies from being obtain'd by the enemy,but in reality for beating down their price in favor of the contractors,in whose profits, it was said, perhaps from suspicion only, he hada share.  And, when at length the embargo was taken off, by neglectingto send notice of it to Charlestown, the Carolina fleet was detain'dnear three months longer, whereby their bottoms were so much damagedby the worm that a great part of them foundered in their passage home.Shirley was, I believe, sincerely glad of being relieved fromso burdensome a charge as the conduct of an army must be to a manunacquainted with military business.  I was at the entertainmentgiven by the city of New York to Lord Loudoun, on his taking upon himthe command.  Shirley, tho' thereby superseded, was present also.There was a great company of officers, citizens, and strangers, and,some chairs having been borrowed in the neighborhood, there was one amongthem very low, which fell to the lot of Mr. Shirley.  Perceiving itas I sat by him, I said, 'They have given you, sir, too low a seat.''No matter,' says he, 'Mr. 
ENTP	, I find a low seat the easiest.'While I was, as afore mention'd, detain'd at New York, I receiv'dall the accounts of the provisions, etc., that I had furnish'dto Braddock, some of which accounts could not sooner be obtain'dfrom the different persons I had employ'd to assist in the business.I presented them to Lord Loudoun, desiring to be paid the ballance.He caus'd them to be regularly examined by the proper officer, who,after comparing every article with its voucher, certified themto be right; and the balance due for which his lordship promis'dto give me an order on the paymaster.  This was, however, put offfrom time to time; and, tho' I call'd often for it by appointment,I did not get it.  At length, just before my departure, he told mehe had, on better consideration, concluded not to mix his accountswith those of his predecessors.  'And you,' says he, 'when in England,have only to exhibit your accounts at the treasury, and you will bepaid immediately.'I mention'd, but without effect, the great and unexpected expense Ihad been put to by being detain'd so long at New York, as a reasonfor my desiring to be presently paid; and on my observing that it wasnot right I should be put to any further trouble or delay in obtainingthe money I had advanc'd, as I charged no commission for my service,'O, sir,' says he, 'you must not think of persuading us that you areno gainer; we understand better those affairs, and know that everyone concerned in supplying the army finds means, in the doing it,to fill his own pockets.'  I assur'd him that was not my case,and that I had not pocketed a farthing; but he appear'd clearlynot to believe me; and, indeed, I have since learnt that immensefortunes are often made in such employments.  As to my ballance,I am not paid it to this day, of which more hereafter.Our captain of the paquet had boasted much, before we sailed,of the swiftness of his ship; unfortunately, when we came to sea,she proved the dullest of ninety-six sail, to his no small mortification.After many conjectures respecting the cause, when we were nearanother ship almost as dull as ours, which, however, gain'd upon us,the captain ordered all hands to come aft, and stand as near the ensignstaff as possible.  We were, passengers included, about forty persons.While we stood there, the ship mended her pace, and soon left herneighbour far behind, which prov'd clearly what our captain suspected,that she was loaded too much by the head.  The casks of water,it seems, had been all plac'd forward; these he therefore order'dto be mov'd further aft, on which the ship recover'd her character,and proved the sailer in the fleet.The captain said she had once gone at the rate of thirteen knots,which is accounted thirteen miles per hour.  We had on board,as a passenger, Captain Kennedy, of the Navy, who contended that itwas impossible, and that no ship ever sailed so fast, and thatthere must have been some error in the division of the log-line,or some mistake in heaving the log.  A wager ensu'd between thetwo captains, to be decided when there should be sufficient wind.Kennedy thereupon examin'd rigorously the log-line, and,being satisfi'd with that, he determin'd to throw the log himself.Accordingly some days after, when the wind blew very fair and fresh,and the captain of the paquet, Lutwidge, said he believ'd she thenwent at the rate of thirteen knots, Kennedy made the experiment,and own'd his wager lost.The above fact I give for the sake of the following observation.It has been remark'd, as an imperfection in the art of ship-building,that it can never be known, till she is tried, whether a new ship willor will not be a good sailer; for that the model of a good-sailingship has been exactly follow'd in a new one, which has prov'd, onthe contrary, remarkably dull.  I apprehend that this may partly beoccasion'd by the different opinions of seamen respecting the modesof lading, rigging, and sailing of a ship; each has his system;and the same vessel, laden by the judgment and orders of one captain,shall sail better or worse than when by the orders of another.Besides, it scarce ever happens that a ship is form'd, fitted forthe sea, and sail'd by the same person.  One man builds the hull,another rigs her, a third lades and sails her.  No one of these hasthe advantage of knowing all the ideas and experience of the others,and, therefore, can not draw just conclusions from a combinationof the whole.Even in the simple operation of sailing when at sea, I haveoften observ'd different judgments in the officers who commandedthe successive watches, the wind being the same.  One would havethe sails trimm'd sharper or flatter than another, so that theyseem'd to have no certain rule to govern by.  Yet I think a setof experiments might be instituted, first, to determine the mostproper form of the hull for swift sailing; next, the best dimensionsand properest place for the masts:  then the form and quantityof sails, and their position, as the wind may be; and, lastly,the disposition of the lading.  This is an age of experiments,and I think a set accurately made and combin'd would be of great use.I am persuaded, therefore, that ere long some ingenious philosopherwill undertake it, to whom I wish success.We were several times chas'd in our passage, but outsail'd every thing,and in thirty days had soundings.  We had a good observation,and the captain judg'd himself so near our port, Falmouth, that,if we made a good run in the night, we might be off the mouthof that harbor in the morning, and by running in the night mightescape the notice of the enemy's privateers, who often crus'd nearthe entrance of the channel.  Accordingly, all the sail was setthat we could possibly make, and the wind being very fresh and fair,we went right before it, and made great way.  The captain,after his observation, shap'd his course, as he thought, so as topass wide of the Scilly Isles; but it seems there is sometimesa strong indraught setting up St. George's Channel, which deceivesseamen and caused the loss of Sir Cloudesley Shovel's squadron.This indraught was probably the cause of what happened to us.We had a watchman plac'd in the bow, to whom they often called,'Look well out before there,' and he as often answered, 'Ay ay;' but perhaps had his eyes shut, and was half asleep at the time,they sometimes answering, as is said, mechanically; for he did notsee a light just before us, which had been hid by the studdingsailsfrom the man at the helm, and from the rest of the watch,but by an accidental yaw of the ship was discover'd, and occasion'da great alarm, we being very near it, the light appearingto me as big as a cart-wheel. It was midnight, and our captainfast asleep; but Captain Kennedy, jumping upon deck, and seeingthe danger, ordered the ship to wear round, all sails standing;an operation dangerous to the masts, but it carried us clear,and we escaped shipwreck, for we were running right upon the rockson which the light-house was erected.  This deliverance impressedme strongly with the utility of light-houses, and made me resolveto encourage the building more of them in America, if I should liveto return there.In the morning it was found by the soundings, etc., that we were nearour port, but a thick fog hid the land from our sight.  About nineo'clock the fog began to rise, and seem'd to be lifted up fromthe water like the curtain at a play-house, discovering underneath,the town of Falmouth, the vessels in its harbor, and the fieldsthat surrounded it.  This was a most pleasing spectacle to thosewho had been so long without any other prospects than the uniformview of a vacant ocean, and it gave us the more pleasure as wewere now free from the anxieties which the state of war occasion'd.I set out immediately, with my son, for London, and we only stopta little by the way to view Stonehenge on Salisbury Plain, and LordPembroke's house and gardens, with his very curious antiquitiesat Wilton.  We arrived in London the 27th of July, 1757.<16>     <16> Here terminates the Autobiography, as published by          Wm. Temple 
ENTP	 and his successors.  What follows          was written in the last year of Dr. 's life,          and was first printed (in English) in Mr. Bigelow's          edition of 1868.--ED.AS SOON as I was settled in a lodging Mr. Charles had provided for me,I went to visit Dr. Fothergill, to whom I was strongly recommended,and whose counsel respecting my proceedings I was advis'd to obtain.He was against an immediate complaint to government, and thoughtthe proprietaries should first be personally appli'd to, who mightpossibly be induc'd by the interposition and persuasion of someprivate friends, to accommodate matters amicably.  I then waitedon my old friend and correspondent, Mr. Peter Collinson, who toldme that John Hanbury, the great Virginia merchant, had requestedto be informed when I should arrive, that he might carry me to LordGranville's, who was then President of the Council and wished to seeme as soon as possible.  I agreed to go with him the next morning.Accordingly Mr. Hanbury called for me and took me in his carriageto that nobleman's, who receiv'd me with great civility; and aftersome questions respecting the present state of affairs in Americaand discourse thereupon, he said to me:  'You Americans have wrongideas of the nature of your constitution; you contend that the king'sinstructions to his governors are not laws, and think yourselvesat liberty to regard or disregard them at your own discretion.But those instructions are not like the pocket instructions givento a minister going abroad, for regulating his conduct in sometrifling point of ceremony.  They are first drawn up by judgeslearned in the laws; they are then considered, debated, and perhapsamended in Council, after which they are signed by the king.They are then, so far as they relate to you, the law of the land,for the king is the LEGISLATOR OF THE COLONIES.'  I told hislordship this was new doctrine to me.  I had always understoodfrom our charters that our laws were to be made by our Assemblies,to be presented indeed to the king for his royal assent,but that being once given the king could not repeal or alter them.And as the Assemblies could not make permanent laws withouthis assent, so neither could he make a law for them without theirs.He assur'd me I was totally mistaken.  I did not think so, however,and his lordship's conversation having a little alarm'd me as towhat might be the sentiments of the court concerning us, I wroteit down as soon as I return'd to my lodgings.  I recollected thatabout 20 years before, a clause in a bill brought into Parliamentby the ministry had propos'd to make the king's instructions lawsin the colonies, but the clause was thrown out by the Commons,for which we adored them as our friends and friends of liberty,till by their conduct towards us in 1765 it seem'd that they hadrefus'd that point of sovereignty to the king only that they mightreserve it for themselves.After some days, Dr. Fothergill having spoken to the proprietaries,they agreed to a meeting with me at Mr. T. Penn's house in Spring Garden.The conversation at first consisted of mutual declarationsof disposition to reasonable accommodations, but I suppose eachparty had its own ideas of what should be meant by reasonable.We then went into consideration of our several points of complaint,which I enumerated.  The proprietaries justify'd their conductas well as they could, and I the Assembly's. We now appearedvery wide, and so far from each other in our opinions as todiscourage all hope of agreement.  However, it was concludedthat I should give them the heads of our complaints in writing,and they promis'd then to consider them.  I did so soon after,but they put the paper into the hands of their solicitor,Ferdinand John Paris, who managed for them all their law businessin their great suit with the neighbouring proprietary of Maryland,Lord Baltimore, which had subsisted 70 years, and wrote for themall their papers and messages in their dispute with the Assembly.He was a proud, angry man, and as I had occasionally in the answersof the Assembly treated his papers with some severity, they beingreally weak in point of argument and haughty in expression,he had conceived a mortal enmity to me, which discovering itselfwhenever we met, I declin'd the proprietary's proposal that heand I should discuss the heads of complaint between our two selves,and refus'd treating with any one but them.  They then by his adviceput the paper into the hands of the Attorney and Solicitor-Generalfor their opinion and counsel upon it, where it lay unanswereda year wanting eight days, during which time I made frequent demandsof an answer from the proprietaries, but without obtaining any otherthan that they had not yet received the opinion of the Attorneyand Solicitor-General.  What it was when they did receive it Inever learnt, for they did not communicate it to me, but sent a longmessage to the Assembly drawn and signed by Paris, reciting my paper,complaining of its want of formality, as a rudeness on my part,and giving a flimsy justification of their conduct, adding that theyshould be willing to accommodate matters if the Assembly would sendout some person of candour to treat with them for that purpose,intimating thereby that I was not such.The want of formality or rudeness was, probably, my not havingaddress'd the paper to them with their assum'd titles of Trueand Absolute Proprietaries of the Province of Pennsylvania,which I omitted as not thinking it necessary in a paper,the intention of which was only to reduce to a certainty by writing,what in conversation I had delivered viva voce.But during this delay, the Assembly having prevailed with Gov'rDenny to pass an act taxing the proprietary estate in common withthe estates of the people, which was the grand point in dispute,they omitted answering the message.When this act however came over, the proprietaries, counselledby Paris, determined to oppose its receiving the royal assent.Accordingly they petition'd the king in Council, and a hearing wasappointed in which two lawyers were employ'd by them against the act,and two by me in support of it.  They alledg'd that the act wasintended to load the proprietary estate in order to spare thoseof the people, and that if it were suffer'd to continue in force,and the proprietaries who were in odium with the people, left to theirmercy in proportioning the taxes, they would inevitably be ruined.We reply'd that the act had no such intention, and would have nosuch effect.  That the assessors were honest and discreet men underan oath to assess fairly and equitably, and that any advantage eachof them might expect in lessening his own tax by augmenting that ofthe proprietaries was too trifling to induce them to perjure themselves.This is the purport of what I remember as urged by both sides,except that we insisted strongly on the mischievous consequencesthat must attend a repeal, for that the money, L100,000, being printedand given to the king's use, expended in his service, and now spreadamong the people, the repeal would strike it dead in their handsto the ruin of many, and the total discouragement of future grants,and the selfishness of the proprietors in soliciting such ageneral catastrophe, merely from a groundless fear of their estatebeing taxed too highly, was insisted on in the strongest terms.On this, Lord Mansfield, one of the counsel rose, and beckoning metook me into the clerk's chamber, while the lawyers were pleading,and asked me if I was really of opinion that no injury would be donethe proprietary estate in the execution of the act.  I said certainly.'Then,' says he, 'you can have little objection to enter intoan engagement to assure that point.'  I answer'd, 'None at all.'He then call'd in Paris, and after some discourse, his lordship'sproposition was accepted on both sides; a paper to the purpose wasdrawn up by the Clerk of the Council, which I sign'd with Mr. Charles,who was also an Agent of the Province for their ordinary affairs,when Lord Mansfield returned to the Council Chamber, where finallythe law was allowed to pass.  Some changes were however recommendedand we also engaged they should be made by a subsequent law,but the Assembly did not think them necessary; for one year's taxhaving been levied by the act before the order of Council arrived,they appointed a committee to examine the proceedings of the assessors,and on this committee they put several particular friends ofthe proprietaries.  After a full enquiry, they unanimously sign'da report that they found the tax had been assess'd with perfect equity.The Assembly looked into my entering into the first part ofthe engagement, as an essential service to the Province, since itsecured the credit of the paper money then spread over all the country.They gave me their thanks in form when I return'd. But the proprietarieswere enraged at Governor Denny for having pass'd the act, and turn'dhim out with threats of suing him for breach of instructionswhich he had given bond to observe.  He, however, having done itat the instance of the General, and for His Majesty's service,and having some powerful interest at court, despis'd the threatsand they were never put in execution.  . . .
ESTP	 ITHE UGANDA RAILWAYThe aspect of Mombasa as she rises from the sea and clothes herselfwith form and colour at the swift approach of the ship is alluring andeven delicious. But to appreciate all these charms the travellershould come from the North. He should see the hot stones of Malta,baking and glistening on a steel-blue Mediterranean. He should visitthe Island of Cyprus before the autumn rains have revived the soil,when the Messaoria Plain is one broad wilderness of dust, when everytree--be it only a thorn-bush--is an heirloom, and every drop of wateris a jewel. He should walk for two hours at midday in the streets ofPort Said. He should thread the long red furrow of the Suez Canal, andswelter through the trough of the Red Sea. He should pass a day amongthe cinders of Aden, and a week among the scorched rocks and stones ofNorthern Somaliland; and then, after five days of open sea, his eyeand mind will be prepared to salute with feelings of grateful delightthese shores of vivid and exuberant green. On every side isvegetation, moist, tumultuous, and varied. Great trees, clad in densefoliage, shrouded in creepers, springing from beds of verdure, thrustthemselves through the undergrowth; palms laced together by floweringtrailers; every kind of tropical plant that lives by rain andsunshine; high waving grass, brilliant patches of purplebougainvillea, and in the midst, dotted about, scarcely keeping theirheads above the fertile flood of Nature, the red-roofed houses of thetown and port of Mombasa.  [Illustration: SKETCH MAP OF    'MY AFRICAN JOURNEY']The vessel follows a channel twisting away between high bluffs, andfinds a secure anchorage, land-locked, in forty feet of water at astone's throw from the shore. Here we are arrived at the gate ofBritish East Africa; and more, at the outlet and debouchment of allthe trade of all the countries that lap the Victoria and Albert Lakesand the head-waters of the Nile. Along the pier now being built atKilindini, the harbour of Mombasa Island, must flow, at any rate formany years, the main stream of East and Central African commerce.Whatever may be the produce which civilized government and enterprisewill draw from the enormous territories between Southern Abyssinia andLake Tanganyika, between Lake Rudolf and Ruenzori, as far west as thehead-streams of the Congo, as far north as the Lado enclave; whatevermay be the needs and demands of the numerous populations comprisedwithin those limits, it is along the unpretentious jetty of Kilindinithat the whole traffic must pass.For Kilindini (or Mombasa, as I may be permitted to call it) is thestarting-point of one of the most romantic and most wonderful railwaysin the world. The two iron streaks of rail that wind away among thehills and foliage of Mombasa Island do not break their smooth monotonyuntil, after piercing Equatorial forests, stretching across immenseprairies, and climbing almost to the level of the European snow-line,they pause--and that only for a time--upon the edges of the GreatLake. And thus is made a sure, swift road along which the white manand all that he brings with him, for good or ill, may penetrate intothe heart of Africa as easily and safely as he may travel from Londonto Vienna.Short has been the life, many the vicissitudes, of the Uganda Railway.The adventurous enterprise of a Liberal Government, it was soonexposed, disowned, to the merciless criticism of its parents. Adoptedas a cherished foundling by the Conservative party, it almost perishedfrom mismanagement in their hands. Nearly ten thousand pounds a milewere expended upon its construction; and so eager were all parties tobe done with it and its expense that, instead of pursuing its properand natural route across the plateau to the deep waters of PortVictoria, it fell by the way into the shallow gulf of Kavirondo, luckyto get so far. It is easy to censure, it is impossible not tocriticize, the administrative mistakes and miscalculations whichtarnished and nearly marred a brilliant conception. But it is stillmore easy, as one traverses in forty-eight hours countries which tenyears ago would have baffled the toilsome marches of many weeks, tounderrate the difficulties in which unavoidable ignorance andastonishing conditions plunged the pioneers. The British art of'muddling through' is here seen in one of its finest expositions.Through everything--through the forests, through the ravines, throughtroops of marauding lions, through famine, through war, through fiveyears of excoriating Parliamentary debate, muddled and marched therailway; and here at last, in some more or less effective fashion, isit arrived at its goal. Other nations project Central African railwaysas lightly and as easily as they lay down naval programmes; but hereis a railway, like the British Fleet, 'in being'--not a paper plan oran airy dream, but an iron fact grinding along through the jungle andthe plain, waking with its whistles the silences of the Nyanza, andstartling the tribes out of their primordial nakedness with'Americani' piece goods _made in Lancashire_.Let us, then, without waiting in Mombasa longer than is necessary towish it well and to admire the fertility and promise of the coastalregion, ascend this railway from the sea to the lake. And first, whata road it is! Everything is in apple-pie order. The track is smoothedand weeded and ballasted as if it were the London and North-Western.Every telegraph-post has its number; every mile, every hundred yards,every change of gradient has its mark; not in soft wood, to feed thewhite ant, but in hard, well-painted iron. Constant labour hassteadily improved the grades and curves of the permanent-way, and thetrain--one of those comfortable, practical Indian trains--rolls alongas evenly as upon a European line.Nor should it be supposed that this high standard of maintenance isnot warranted by the present financial position of the line. TheUganda Railway is already doing what it was never expected within anyreasonable period to do. It is paying its way. It is beginning toyield a profit--albeit a small profit--upon its capital charge.Projected solely as a political railway to reach Uganda, and to secureBritish predominance upon the Upper Nile, it has already achieved acommercial value. Instead of the annual deficits upon working expenseswhich were regularly anticipated by those most competent to judge,there is already a substantial profit of nearly eighty thousand poundsa year. And this is but the beginning, and an imperfect beginning; forat present the line is only a trunk, without its necessary limbs andfeeders, without its deep-water head at Kilindini, without its fulltale of steamers on the lake; above all, without its natural andnecessary extension to the Albert Nyanza.  [Illustration: ON THE COW-CATCHER.    (Mr. Currie, Mr. Marsh, Col. Wilson, Sir J. Hayes-Sadler, Mr.    Churchill.)]We may divide the journey into four main stages--the jungles, theplains, the mountains, and the lake, for the lake is an essential partof the railway, and a natural and inexpensive extension to its length.In the early morning, then, we start from Mombasa Station, taking ourplaces upon an ordinary garden seat fastened on to the cow-catcher ofthe engine, from which position the whole country can be seen. For aquarter of an hour we are still upon Mombasa Island, and then thetrain, crossing the intervening channel by a long iron bridge,addresses itself in earnest to the continent of Africa. Into thesevast regions the line winds perseveringly upon a stiff up-grade, andthe land unfolds itself ridge after ridge and valley after valley,till soon, with one farewell glance at the sea and at thefighting-tops of His Majesty's ship _Venus_ rising queerly amid thepalms, we are embraced and engulfed completely. All day long the trainruns upward and westward, through broken and undulating ground cladand encumbered with super-abundant vegetation. Beautiful birds andbutterflies fly from tree to tree and flower to flower. Deep, raggedgorges, filled by streams in flood, open out far below us throughglades of palms and creeper-covered trees. Here and there, atintervals, which will become shorter every year, are plantations ofrubber, fibre, and cotton, the beginnings of those inexhaustiblesupplies which will one day meet the yet unmeasured demand of Europefor those indispensable commodities. Every few miles are little trimstations, with their water-tanks, signals, ticket-offices, andflower-beds complete and all of a pattern, backed by impenetrablebush. In brief one slender thread of scientific civilization, oforder, authority, and arrangement, drawn across the primeval chaos ofthe world.In the evening a cooler, crisper air is blowing. The humid coastlands, with their glories and their fevers, have been left behind. Atan altitude of four thousand feet we begin to laugh at the Equator.The jungle becomes forest, not less luxuriant, but distinctlydifferent in character. The olive replaces the palm. The whole aspectof the land is more friendly, more familiar, and no less fertile.After Makindu Station the forest ceases. The traveller enters upon aregion of grass. Immense fields of green pasture, withered andwhitened at this season by waiting for the rains, intersected bystreams and watercourses densely wooded with dark, fir-looking treesand gorse-looking scrub, and relieved by bold upstanding bluffs andridges, comprise the new panorama. And here is presented the wonderfuland unique spectacle which the Uganda Railway offers to the European._The plains are crowded with wild animals._ From the windows of thecarriage the whole zoological gardens can be seen disporting itself.Herds of antelope and gazelle, troops of zebras--sometimes four orfive hundred together--watch the train pass with placid assurance, orscamper a hundred yards farther away, and turn again. Many are quiteclose to the line. With field-glasses one can see that it is the sameeverywhere, and can distinguish long files of black wildebeeste andherds of red kongoni--the hartebeeste of South Africa--and wildostriches walking sedately in twos and threes, and every kind of smalldeer and gazelle. The zebras come close enough for their stripes to beadmired with the naked eye.We have arrived at Simba, 'The Place of Lions,' and there is no reasonwhy the passengers should not see one, or even half-a-dozen, stalkingacross the plain, respectfully observed by lesser beasts. Indeed, inthe early days it was the custom to stop and sally out upon the royalvermin whenever met with, and many the lion that has been carried backto the tender in triumph before the guard, or driver, or any one elsecould think of timetables or the block system, or the otherinconvenient restrictions of a regular service. Farther up the line,in the twilight of the evening, we saw, not a hundred yards away, adozen giraffes lollopping off among scattered trees, and at Nakuru sixyellow lions walked in leisurely mood across the rails in broaddaylight. Only the rhinoceros is absent, or rarely seen, and after oneof his species had measured his strength, unsuccessfully, against anengine, he has confined himself morosely to the river-beds and to theundisturbed solitudes which, at a distance of two or three miles,everywhere engulf the Uganda Railway.Our carriage stopped upon a siding at Simba Station for three days, inorder that we might more closely examine the local fauna. One of thebest ways of shooting game in this part of the world, and certainlythe easiest, is to get a trolly and run up and down the line. Theanimals are so used to the passage of trains and natives along the onegreat highway that they do not, as a rule, take much notice, unlessthe train or trolly stops, when their suspicions are at once aroused.The sportsmen should, therefore, slip off without allowing the vehicleor the rest of the party to stop, even for a moment; and in this wayhe will frequently find himself within two hundred and fifty or threehundred yards of his quarry, when the result will be governed solelyby his skill, or want of skill, with the rifle.There is another method, which we tried on the second day in the hopesof finding a waterbuck, and that is, to prowl about among the treesand undergrowth of the river-bed. In a few minutes one may buryoneself in the wildest and savagest kind of forest. The air becomesstill and hot. The sun seems in an instant to assert his justprerogative. The heat glitters over the open spaces of dry sand andpools of water. High grass, huge boulders, tangled vegetation,multitudes of thorn-bushes, obstruct the march, and the ground itselfis scarped and guttered by the rains into the strangest formations.Around you, breast-high, shoulder-high, overhead, rises the Africanjungle. There is a brooding silence, broken only by the cry of a bird,or the scolding bark of baboons, and the crunching of one's own feeton the crumbling soil. We enter the haunt of the wild beasts; theirtracks, their traces, the remnants of their repasts, are easily andfrequently discovered. Here a lion has passed since the morning. Therea rhinoceros has certainly been within the hour--perhaps within tenminutes. We creep and scramble through the game paths, anxiously,rifles at full cock, not knowing what each turn or step may reveal.The wind, when it blows at all, blows fitfully, now from this quarter,now from that; so that one can never be certain that it will notbetray the intruder in these grim domains to the beast he seeks, or tosome other, less welcome, before he sees him. At length, after twohours' scramble and scrape, we emerge breathless, as from anotherworld, half astonished to find ourselves within a quarter of a mile ofthe railway line, with its trolly, luncheon, soda-water, ice, etc.  [Illustration: THE RHINOCEROS AT SIMBA]But if one would seek the rhinoceros in his open pastures, it isnecessary to go farther afield; and accordingly we started the nextmorning, while the stars were still shining, to tramp over theridges and hills which shut in the railway, and overlook remoterplains and valleys beyond. The grass grows high from groundhoneycombed with holes and heaped with lava boulders, and it wasdaylight before we had stumbled our way to a spur commanding a wideview. Here we halted to search the country with field-glasses, and tobrush off the ticks--detestable insects which infest all the resortsof the game in innumerable swarms, ready to spread any poison amongthe farmers' cattle. The glass disclosed nothing of consequence.Zebra, wildebeeste, and kongoni were to be seen in troops and herds,scattered near and far over the plains, but never a rhinoceros! So wetrudged on, meaning to make a wide circle. For an hour we foundnothing, and then, just as we were thinking of turning homewardsbefore the sun should get his full power, three beautiful oryx, great,dark-coloured antelope with very long, corrugated horns, walked overthe next brow on their way to water. Forthwith we set off in pursuit,crouching and creeping along the valley, and hoping to intercept themat the stream. Two passed safely over before we could reach our point.The third, seeing us, turned back and disappeared over the hill,where, a quarter of an hour later, he was stalked and wounded.It is always the wounded beast that leads the hunter into adventures.Till the quarry is hit every one walks delicately, avoids going thewindward side of unexplored coverts, skirts a reed-bed cautiously,notices a convenient tree, looks often this way and that. But once theprize is almost within reach, you scramble along after it as fast asyour legs will carry you, and never trouble about remotercontingencies, be they what they may. Our oryx led us a mile or moreover rocky slopes, always promising and never giving a good chance fora shot, until at last he drew us round the shoulder of a hill--andthere, abruptly, was the rhinoceros. The impression was extraordinary.A wide plain of white, withered grass stretched away to low hillsbroken with rocks. The rhinoceros stood in the middle of this plain,about five hundred yards away, in jet-black silhouette; not atwentieth-century animal at all, but an odd, grim straggler from theStone Age. He was grazing placidly, and above him the vast snow domeof Kilimanjaro towered up in the clear air of morning to complete ascene unaltered since the dawn of the world.The manner of killing a rhinoceros in the open is crudely simple. Itis thought well usually to select the neighbourhood of a good tree,_where one can be found_, as the centre of the encounter. If no treeis available, you walk up as near as possible to him from any sideexcept the windward, and then shoot him in the head or the heart. Ifyou hit a vital spot, as sometimes happens, he falls. If you hit himanywhere else, he charges blindly and furiously in your direction, andyou shoot him again, or not, as the case may be.Bearing all this carefully in mind, we started out to do battle withBehemoth. We had advanced perhaps two hundred yards towards him, whena cry from one of the natives arrested us. We looked sharply to theright. There, not a hundred and fifty paces distant, under the shadeof a few small trees, stood two other monsters. In a few more steps weshould have tainted their wind and brought them up with a rush; andsuppose this had happened, when perhaps we were already compromisedwith our first friend, and had him wounded and furious on our hands!Luckily warned in time, to creep back to the shoulder of the hill, toskirt its crest, and to emerge a hundred and twenty yards from thisnew objective was the work of a few minutes. We hurriedly agree tokill one first before touching the other. At such a range it is easyto hit so great a target; but the bull's-eye is small. I fired. Thethud of a bullet which strikes with an impact of a ton and a quarter,tearing through hide and muscle and bone with the hideous energy ofcordite, came back distinctly. The large rhinoceros started, stumbled,turned directly towards the sound and the blow, and then bore straightdown upon us in a peculiar trot, nearly as fast as a horse's gallop,with an activity surprising in so huge a beast, and instinct withunmistakable purpose.  [Illustration: BRITISH EAST AFRICA]Great is the moral effect of a foe who advances. Everybody fired.Still the ponderous brute came on, as if he were invulnerable; as ifhe were an engine, or some great steam barge impervious to bullets,insensible to pain or fear. Thirty seconds more, and he will close. Animpalpable curtain seems to roll itself up in the mind, revealing amental picture, strangely lighted, yet very still, where objects havenew values, and where a patch of white grass in the foreground,four or five yards away, seems to possess astonishing significance. Itis there that the last two shots that yet remain before the resourcesof civilization are exhausted must be fired. There is time to reflectwith some detachment that, after all, we were the aggressors; we it iswho have forced the conflict by an unprovoked assault with murderousintent upon a peaceful herbivore; that if there is such a thing asright and wrong between man and beast--and who shall say there isnot?--right is plainly on his side; there is time for this before Iperceive that, stunned and dazed by the frightful concussions ofmodern firearms, he has swerved sharp to the right, and is now movingacross our front, broadside on, at the same swift trot. More firing,and as I reload some one says he is down, and I fire instead at hissmaller companion, already some distance off upon the plain. But onerhinoceros hunt is like another, except in its details, and I will notoccupy the reader with the account of this new pursuit and death.Suffice it to say that, in all the elements of neurotic experience,such an encounter seems to me fully equal to half an hour's briskskirmish at six or seven hundred yards--and with an importantaddition. In war there is a cause, there is duty, there is the hopeof glory, for who can tell what may not be won before night? But hereat the end is only a hide, a horn, and a carcase, over which thevultures have already begun to wheel.
ESTP	 IIAROUND MOUNT KENYAThe town of Nairobi, the capital of the East Africa Protectorate,stands on the base of wooded hills at the three hundred andtwenty-seventh mile of the railroad. Originally chosen as a convenientplace for assembling the extensive depots and shops necessary to theconstruction and maintenance of the railway, it enjoys no advantagesas a residential site. The ground on which the town is built is lowand swampy. The supply of water is indifferent, and the situationgenerally unhealthy. A mile farther on, however, upon the risingground a finer position could have been found, and this quarter isalready being occupied sparsely by Government buildings, hospitals,and barracks. It is now too late to change, and thus lack of foresightand of a comprehensive view leaves its permanent imprint upon thecountenance of a new country.Our train traverses the Athi plains, more crowded perhaps with gamethan any other part of the line, and approaches swiftly the long rowsof one-storeyed tin houses which constitute the town. Nairobi is atypical South African township. It might be Pietermaritzburg orLadysmith of twenty years ago, before blue gum-trees and stonebuildings had waxed and multiplied. In its present stage perhaps itresembles Buluwayo most. The population is also South African in itscharacter and proportions. There are five hundred and eighty whites,three thousand one hundred Indians, and ten thousand five hundred andfifty African natives. The shops and stores are, however, much moreconsiderable than these figures would appear to warrant, and are fullycapable of supplying the varied needs of settlers and planters over awide area. Nairobi is also the headquarters of a brigade of the King'sAfrican Rifles, the central office and depot of the Uganda Railway,and the seat of the Administration, with its numerous official_personnel_. The dinner of the Colonists' Association, to which I wasinvited, afforded the familiar, yet in Central Africa notunimpressive, spectacle of long rows of gentlemen in evening dress;while the ball given by the Governor to celebrate the King's birthdayrevealed a company gay with uniforms, and ladies in pretty dresses,assembled upon a spot where scarcely ten years before lions huntedundisturbed.  [Illustration: GUARD OF HONOUR, KING'S AFRICAN RIFLES.]Every white man in Nairobi is a politician; and most of them areleaders of parties. One would scarcely believe it possible, that acentre so new should be able to develop so many divergent andconflicting interests, or that a community so small should be able togive to each such vigorous and even vehement expression. There arealready in miniature all the elements of keen political and racialdiscord, all the materials for hot and acrimonious debate. The whiteman _versus_ the black; the Indian _versus_ both; the settler asagainst the planter; the town contrasted with the country; theofficial class against the unofficial; the coast and the highlands;the railway administration and the Protectorate generally; the King'sAfrican Rifles and the East Africa Protectorate Police; all thesedifferent points of view, naturally arising, honestly adopted,tenaciously held, and not yet reconciled into any harmonious generalconception, confront the visitor in perplexing disarray. Nor will hebe wise to choose his part with any hurry. It is better to seesomething of the country, of its quality and extent, of its promisesand forfeits, of its realities and illusions, before endeavouring toform even a provisional opinion.The snow-clad peak of Mount Kenya, a hundred miles away, can on aclear morning be easily seen from the slopes above Nairobi--a sharp,serrated summit veined with gleaming white. A road--passable, albeitunmetalled, for wagons and even a motor-car--runs thitherward by FortHall and across the Tana River. On the way there is much to see. Awild, ragged-looking, but fertile region, swelling into successiveundulations and intersected by numerous gorges whose streams areshaded by fine trees, unfolds itself to the eye. Scattered about uponspacious estates of many thousand acres are a score or two ofcolonists, each gradually making himself a home and a living in hisown way. One raises stock; another plants coffee, which grows soexuberantly in this generous soil as to threaten the speedy exhaustionof the plant. Here are ostriches, sheep, and cattle standingplacidly together in one drove under the guardianship of a nativechild of eleven. There is a complete dairy farm, admirably equipped.One of the streams has been dammed effectively, and turbines arealready in position to light Nairobi with electricity. Upon the banksof another there is talk of building an hotel.  [Illustration: BREAKDOWN ON THE WAY TO THIKA CAMP.]At one place I found a family of good people from Hightown,Manchester, grappling courageously with an enormous tract of tenthousand acres. Hard by, an old Boer, who has trekked the length ofAfrica to avoid the British flag, sits smoking stolidly by his grasshouse, reconciled to British rule at last by a few months' experienceof paternal government in a neighbouring Protectorate. He has fewcattle and less cash, but he holds decided views as to the whereaboutsof lions; there, moreover, stands the heavy tilted wagon of the GreatTrek--an ark of refuge when all else fails; and for the rest there isplenty of game, few people, and the family grows from year to year. Inshort, one sees a sparse, heterogeneous population engaged in variedlabours; but everywhere hard work, straitened resources, hopespersisting through many disappointments, stout hospitable hearts, andthe beginnings, at any rate, of progress.A camp has been prepared for me in a very beautiful spot at thejuncture of the Chania and Thika rivers. Tents are pitched and grassshelters are erected in a smooth meadow. Southwards, a hundred yardsaway, a fine waterfall plunges downwards over enormous boulders amidtall, interlacing trees. The muffled roar of another rises from a deepravine an equal distance to the north; and the Philistine computes,with a frown, four thousand horse-power expending itself upon thepicturesque.Nothing causes the East African colonist more genuine concern thanthat his guest should not have been provided with a lion. Theknowledge preys upon his mind until it becomes a veritable obsession.He feels some deep reproach is laid upon his own hospitality and thereputation of his adopted country. How to find, and, having found, tokill, a lion is the unvarying theme of conversation; and every placeand every journey is judged by a simple standard--'lions or no lions.'At the Thika camp, then, several gentlemen, accomplished in thisimportant sport, have come together with ponies, rifles, Somalis,and all the other accessories. Some zebras and kongoni have beenkilled and left lying in likely-looking places to attract the lions;and at 4 a.m., rain or shine, we are to go and look for them.  [Illustration: SHOOTING PARTY AT THIKA CAMP.    From left to right--Capt. Sadler, Major Riddell, Mr. Marsh,    Marquis Gandolfi-Hornyold, Hon. K. Dundas, Mr. Percival, Mr.    Churchill, Mr. D. J. Wilson.]The young Englishman, be he officer or settler in the East AfricanHighlands, cuts a hardy figure. His clothes are few and far between: asun hat, a brown flannel shirt with sleeves cut above the elbow andopen to the chest, a pair of thin khaki knickerbockers cut short fiveinches--_at least_--above the knee, boots, and a pair of puttiescomprise the whole attire. Nothing else is worn. The skin, exposed tosun, thorns, and insects, becomes almost as dark as that of thenatives, and so hardened that it is nothing to ride all day with bareknees on the saddle; a truly Spartan discipline from which at leastthe visitor may be excused.This is the way in which they hunt lions. First find the lion, luredto a kill, driven from a reed-bed, or kicked up incontinently by theway. Once viewed he must never be lost sight of for a moment. Mountedon ponies of more or less approved fidelity, three or four daringBritons or Somalis gallop after him, as in India they ride thepig--that is to say, neck or nothing--across rocks, holes, tussocks,nullahs, through high grass, thorn scrub, undergrowth, turning him,shepherding him, heading him this way and that until he is brought tobay. For his part the lion is no seeker of quarrels; he is oftendescribed in accents of contempt. His object throughout is to save hisskin. If, being unarmed, you meet six or seven lions unexpectedly, allyou need do--according to my information--is to speak to them sternlyand they will slink away, while you throw a few stones at them tohurry them up. All the highest authorities recommend this.But when pursued from place to place, chased hither and thither by thewheeling horsemen, the naturally mild disposition of the lion becomesembittered. First he begins to growl and roar at his enemies, in orderto terrify them, and make them leave him in peace. Then he dartslittle short charges at them. Finally, when every attempt at peacefulpersuasion has failed, he pulls up abruptly and offers battle. Once hehas done this, he will run no more. He means to fight, and to fightto the death. He means to charge home; and when a lion, maddened withthe agony of a bullet-wound, distressed by long and hard pursuit, or,most of all, a lioness in defence of her cubs, is definitely committedto the charge, death is the only possible conclusion. Broken limbs,broken jaws, a body raked from end to end, lungs pierced through andthrough, entrails torn and protruding--none of these count. It must bedeath--instant and utter--for the lion, or down goes the man, mauledby septic claws and fetid teeth, crushed and crunched, and poisonedafterwards to make doubly sure. Such are the habits of this cowardlyand wicked animal.It is at the stage when the lion has been determinedly 'bayed' thatthe sportsman from London is usually introduced upon the scene. Hehas, we may imagine, followed the riders as fast as the inequalitiesof the ground, his own want of training, and the burden of a heavyrifle will allow him. He arrives at the spot where the lion iscornered in much the same manner as the matador enters the arena, theothers standing aside deferentially, ready to aid him or divert thelion. If his bullet kills, he is, no doubt, justly proud. If it onlywounds, the lion charges the nearest horseman. For forty yards thecharge of a lion is swifter than the gallop of a racehorse. Theriders, therefore, usually avoid waiting within that distance. Butsometimes they do not; or sometimes the lion sees the man who has shothim; or sometimes all sorts of things happen which make goodstories--afterwards.After this general description no particular example is required, andthe reader need not be disappointed to learn that our lion escapedwhat, no doubt, would have been his certain destruction by thebreaking of a single link in the regular chain of circumstances. Hewas not found upon the kill. His place was taken by a filthy hyena,and it was not until we had beaten thoroughly for two hours more thanthree miles of reed-bed that we saw him--a splendid great yellow cat,looking as big as a bullock--bounding away up the opposite hill. Offstarted our riders like falcons; but alas!--if 'alas!' is the properword--a deep and impassable nullah intervened, necessitating largecircuits and long delays; so that the lion got clean away out of sightof all men, and we were reduced to the slow and tedious process oftracking him footprint by footprint through waving grass, breast-high,hour after hour, always expecting to tread on his tail, andalways--disappointed!  [Illustration: THE BANDA AT THIKA CAMP.]  [Illustration: COLONEL WILSON'S LION.]In the afternoon I had to ride to Fort Hall, where there was to be agreat gathering of Kikuyu chiefs and thousands of their warriors andwomen. The country is much the same as that traversed on the previousday, but greener, smoother, and more pleasant-looking. Fort Hall isnot a fort in any military sense, but the Commissioner's house with aditch round it, a jail, a few houses, and an Indian bazaar. Thestation is hardly well selected, being perched up on a hill out of thereach of any railway--and unhealthy nevertheless. The whole place wascrowded with natives in their most highly ornamented and elaboratenudity, waiting for the war-dance.This ceremony was performed the next morning. Long before daylight thebeating of drums, the blowing of horns, and the rhythm of loud, yetnot altogether unmelodious chanting awakened the weariest sleeper; andwhen, at eight o'clock the _indaba_ began, the whole space in front ofthe fort was densely packed with naked, painted, plumed, and gyratinghumanity, which seethed continually to and fro, and divided from timeto time as particular chiefs advanced with their followers, or asgifts of struggling sheep and bulls were brought forward. In his wardress the Kikuyu, and, still more, the Masai warrior, is a striking,if not impressive, figure. His hair and body are smeared with the redearth of his native land, compounded into a pigment by mixture withthe slimy juice of the castor-oil plant, which abounds. Fantasticheaddresses, some of ostrich feathers, others of metal or leather;armlets and leglets of twisted wire; stripes of white clay rubbedacross the red pigment; here and there an old pot-hat or some Europeangarment, incongruously contrasted with leopard-skins and bulls' horns;broad, painted cow-hide shields, and spears with soft iron bladesnearly four feet long, complete a grotesque and indecorous picture.Still, there is a sleek grace about these active forms--bronze statuesbut for their frippery--which defeats all their own efforts to makethemselves hideous. The chiefs, however, succeed in reducingthemselves to regular guys. Any old, cast-off khaki jacket or tatteredpair of trousers; any fragment of weather-stained uniform, abattered sun-helmet with a feather stuck lamely into the top of it, aragged umbrella, is sufficient to induce them to abandon the ostrichplume and the leopard-skin kaross. Among their warriors in ancientgear they look ridiculous and insignificant--more like the commonestkind of native sweeper than the hereditary rulers of some powerful andnumerous tribe.  [Illustration: 'DURBAR' AT KIAMBU.]It is unquestionably an advantage that the East African negro shoulddevelop a taste for civilized attire. In no more useful and innocentdirection could his wants be multiplied and his desires excited, andit is by this process of assimilation that his life will gradually bemade more complicated, more varied, less crudely animal, and himselfraised to a higher level of economic utility. But it would surely beworth while to organize and guide this new motive force withingraceful and appropriate limits. A Government runs risks when itintrudes upon the domain of fashion; but when a veritable abyss ofknowledge and science separates the rulers from the ruled, whenauthority is dealing with a native race still plunged in its primarysqualour, without religion, without clothes, without morals, butwilling to emerge and capable of emerging, such risks may fairly beaccepted; and the Government might well prescribe or present suitablerobes for ceremonial occasions to the chiefs, and gradually encourage,and more gradually still enforce, their adoption throughout thepopulation.After the dance it had been arranged that I should go as far as thebank of the Tana River to see the view of Mount Kenya, and then returnto the Thika camp before night. But when the whole splendid panoramaof the trans-Tana country opened upon us, I could not bring myself tostop short of the promised land; and, casting away material cares ofluncheon and baggage, I decided to ride through to Embo, twenty-eightmiles from Fort Hall, and our most advanced post in this direction. Wecrossed the Tana by a ferry which travels along a rope under theimpulsion of the current. The ponies swam the deep, strong, sixty-yardstream of turbulent red water. On the farther bank the country isreally magnificent in quality and aspect. The centre of the picture isalways Mount Kenya; but there never was a mountain which made solittle of its height. It rises by long gentle slopes, more like aswelling of ground than a peak, from an immense upland plain, and sogradual is the acclivity that, but for the sudden outcrop of snow-cladrock which crowns the summit, no one would believe it over eighteenthousand feet high. It is its gradual rise that imparts so great avalue to this noble mountain; for about its enormous base and upon itsslopes, traversed by hundreds of streams of clear perennial water,there grows, or may grow, in successive, concentric belts, every kindof crop and forest known in the world, from the Equator to the ArcticCircle. The landscape is superb. In beauty, in fertility, in verdure,in the coolness of the air, in the abundance of running water, in itsrich red soil, in the variety of its vegetation, the scenery aboutKenya far surpasses anything I have ever seen in India or SouthAfrica, and challenges comparison with the fairest countries ofEurope. Indeed, looking at it with an eye fresh from Italy, I was mostpowerfully reminded of the upper valleys of the Po.We rode on all day through this delicious country, along a well-keptnative road, smooth enough for a bicycle, except where it crossedstream after stream on primitive bridges. On every side the soil wascultivated and covered with the crops of a large and industriouspopulation. It is only a year since regular control was establishedbeyond the Tana, not without some bloodshed, by a small militaryexpedition. Yet so peaceful are the tribes--now that their intertribalfighting has been stopped--that white officers ride freely about amongtheir villages without even carrying a pistol. All the natives metwith on the road were armed with sword and spear, and all offered ustheir customary salutations, while many came up smiling and holdingout long, moist, delicate-looking hands for me to shake, till I hadquite enough of it. Indeed, the only dangers of the road appear to befrom the buffaloes which infest the country, and after nightfall placethe traveller in real peril. We were very glad for this reason, andalso because we had eaten nothing but a banana each since earlymorning, to see at last on the top of the next hill the buildings ofEmbo just as the sun sank beneath the horizon.Embo is a model station, only five months old--one small, three-roomedhouse for the District Commissioner, one for the military officer, anoffice, and a tiny jail, all in good dressed stone; two Indian shopsin corrugated iron; and seven or eight long rows of beehive grass hutsfor a hundred and fifty soldiers and police. Two young whiteofficers--a civilian and a soldier--preside from this centre ofauthority, far from the telegraph, over the peace and order of an areaas large as an English county, and regulate the conduct and fortunesof some seventy-five thousand natives, who have never previously knownor acknowledged any law but violence or terror. They were uncommonlysurprised to see four horsemen come riding up the zigzag path to theirdwelling; but their astonishment was no bar to their hospitality, andwe were soon rewarded for our journey and our fasting in mostexcellent fashion.I had just time before the darkness flooded the land and blotted outthe mighty mountain and its wreaths of fire-tipped cloud to walk roundthis station. The jail consisted of a single room, barred and bolted.Inside not a prisoner was to be seen. I inquired where they were, andwas shown two little groups seated round fires in the open. They werechained together by a light running chain, and after a hard day'smiscellaneous work about the station they chatted peacefully as theycooked and ate their evening meal. The prison was only their shelterfor the night--primitive arrangements, no doubt, but are they morebarbarous than the hideous, long-drawn precision of an English convictestablishment?The African protectorates now administered by the Colonial Officeafford rare scope for the abilities of earnest and intelligent youth.A man of twenty-five may easily find himself ruling a large tract ofcountry and a numerous population. The Government is too newlyestablished to have developed the highly centralized and closelyknit--perhaps too closely knit--hierarchy and control of the Indiansystem. It is far too poor to afford a complete Administration. TheDistrict Commissioner must judge for himself, and be judged upon hisactions. Very often--for tropical diseases make many gaps in theranks, and men must often return to England to recruit theirhealth--the officer is not a District Commissioner at all, but ajunior acting in his stead or in some one's stead, sometimes for ayear or more. To him there come day by day the natives of thedistrict with all their troubles, disputes, and intrigues. Theirgrowing appreciation of the impartial justice of the tribunal leadsthem increasingly to carry all sorts of cases to the DistrictCommissioner's Court. When they are ill they come and ask formedicine. When they are wounded in their quarrels it is to the whiteman they go to have the injuries dressed. Disease and accident have tobe combated without professional skill. Courts of justice and forms oflegality must be maintained without lawyers. Taxes have to becollected by personal influence. Peace has to be kept with only ashadow of force.All these great opportunities of high service, and many others, areoften and daily placed within the reach of men in their twenties--onthe whole with admirable results. It was most pleasant to hear withwhat comprehension and sympathy the officers of the East AfricaProtectorate speak about their work; and how they regard themselves asthe guardians of native interests and native rights against those whoonly care about exploiting the country and its people. No one cantravel even for a little while among the Kikuyu tribes withoutacquiring a liking for these light-hearted, tractable, if brutishchildren, or without feeling that they are capable of being instructedand raised from their present degradation. There are more than fourmillion aboriginals in East Africa alone. Their care imposes a grave,and I think an inalienable, responsibility upon the BritishGovernment. It will be an ill day for these native races when theirfortunes are removed from the impartial and august administration ofthe Crown and abandoned to the fierce self-interest of a small whitepopulation. Such an event is no doubt very remote. Yet the speculator,the planter, and the settler are knocking at the door. There are manythings which ought to be done--good, wise, scientific, and justlyprofitable. If the Government cannot find the money to develop thenatural economic strength of the country, to make its communications,to start its industries, can it with any reason bar the field toprivate enterprise? Can it prevent the ingress of a white population?Ought it to do so, and for how long? What is to happen when there arethirty thousand white people in East Africa, instead of the threethousand or so who make so much stir at the present time? Perhaps thecourse of these chapters will lead us back again to these questions.I am very doubtful whether it will supply their answers.We have a discussion in the evening on a much more manageable subject.The District Commissioner at Embo has been ordered by the High Courtof the Protectorate to retry a criminal case which he had settled somemonths before, on account of an informality in the report of theproceedings, which had excited the attention of the revisingauthority. It is pointed out that neither the accused nor hisfellow-natives understand, or can ever be made to understand, themeaning of this repetition of a trial; that they are bewildered; thattheir confidence in their personal ruler may be weakened; that endlesspractical difficulties--for instance, the collection of witnessesscattered about in distant villages, and the disquietude caused tothem by a second summons from the strange, mysterious power called'Government'--arise out of an error which only a lawyer could detect,and which only appears upon a piece of paper. 'Some one,' quaintlysays a young civil officer, who has ridden over with us, 'forgot tosay 'Bo!' in the right place.' I ask the nature of the 'Bo!' It iscertainly substantial. No mention was made in the report of the trialthat the accused was given the opportunity of cross-examining thehostile witnesses. Therefore, although this was in fact done, thetrial is held to be no trial, and ordered anew.Now, here is again a balancing of disadvantages; but without hereexamining whether a simple release would not have been better than aretrial, I find myself plainly on the side of the 'Bo!' There isscarcely anything more important in the government of men than theexact--I will even say the pedantic--observance of the regular formsby which the guilt or innocence of accused persons is determined.Those forms are designed to protect the prisoner, not merely from theconsequences of honest forgetfulness in his judges, but fromsystematic carelessness and possible oppression. Once they are allowedto be loosely construed the whole system of civilized jurisprudencebegins to crumble, and in its place there is gradually erected arough-and-ready practice dependent entirely for its efficiency andfairness upon the character and intelligence of the individualresponsible. Necessary as it is to trust to personal authority in thecontrol of native races of the lowest standard, it is not lessnecessary to assign well-marked limits to that authority, and, aboveall, to place the simple primary rights of accused persons to what weat home are accustomed to call a 'fair trial' outside its scope. Nordoes the administrator really suffer in native eyes from theapparition into his domain of superior authority. The tribesmen seethat their ruler--to them all-powerful, the man of soldiers andpolice, of punishment and reward--is himself obedient to some remoteexternal force, and they wonder what that mysterious force can be andmarvel dimly at its greatness. Authority is enhanced and not impairedby the suggestion of immense reserves behind and above the immediateruler--strong though he be. But upon this, as upon other matters, itis not necessary for every one to be of the same opinion; and evenlawyers are not always wise.On our homeward ride in the early morning we passed a Swahili village.These Mohammedans have penetrated deeply and established themselveswidely in the Eastern parts of Africa. Armed with a superior religionand strengthened with Arab blood, they maintain themselves withoutdifficulty at a far higher level than the pagan aboriginals amongwhom they live. Their language has become a sort of _lingua franca_over all this part of the world. As traders they are welcomed, asfighting men they are respected, and as sorcerers they are feared byall the tribes. Their Khan had supplied us with bananas on theprevious day with many expressions of apology that, as we wereunexpected, he had no 'European food.' To-day all this was repaired.The men of the village, to the number of perhaps fifty, walkedsedately out to meet us, their long white smocks in striking contrastto the naked, painted barbarians who surrounded them. The Khan led upa white Arab stallion, of vicious temper and tripling gait, to replacemy wearied pony; and then produced tea and a familiar tin of mixedbiscuits, which he had over-night sent runners to procure, that hishospitality might incur no reproach.While we were eating and parleying with the Khan there arrived on thescene a mounted Kikuyu chief, with chair, umbrella, khaki helmet, andother insignia, and attended by about a hundred warriors in fullfeather. In order to show their respect they began at once theirwar-dance, and we left them a quarter of an hour later still circlingand hopping to and fro with quivering spears and nodding plumes totheir monotonous chorus, while the white-robed Swahilis stood gravelyby and bade us farewell in the dignified manners of the East. Ireflected upon the interval that separates these two races from eachother, and on the centuries of struggle that the advance had cost, andI wondered whether that interval was wider and deeper than that whichdivides the modern European from them both; but without arriving atany sure conclusion.Our journey to Embo had been so delightful that I was not inclined tohanker after rejected alternatives. But when we drove in to the Thikacamp as the sun was setting, tired out by fifty miles of road, thefirst spectacle which saluted my eyes was a lion's skin spread outupon the ground and Colonel Wilson engaged in sprinkling it witharsenical powder. Then we were told the tale, which in brief was thatthey were driving a long reed-bed, when the lion sprang out and ranobliquely across the line of beaters. Wilson fired and the lionbounded back into the reeds, whence stones, fires, shoutings, shots,and all other disturbances failed to move him. Whereupon, after twohours, being impatient and venturesome, they had marched in upon himshoulder to shoulder, to find him, fortunately, quite dead.My friends endeavoured to console me by the news that lions had nowbeen heard of in two other places, and that we should be sure to findone in the morning; and next day, after we had driven three miles ofreeds, it seemed that their hopes were well founded, for a largeanimal of some kind could be seen moving swiftly to and fro undercover, and every one declared this must be the lion. At last only onemore patch of reeds remained to beat, and we took up our positions,finger on trigger, about sixty yards from the farther edge of it,while the beaters, raising an astonishing tumult with yells and thebeating of tin cans, plunged boldly in. _Parturiunt montes_--outrushed two enormous wart-hogs. Let no one reproach the courage of thepig. These great fierce boars, driven from their last shelter, chargedout in gallant style--tusks gleaming, tails perpendicular--and met afate prepared for a king. With these and another which we gallopeddown and pistolled on the way home I had to be content, and can now,so far as I am concerned, sadly write, in the expressive words ofReuter, 'No lions were 'bagged.''
ESTP	 IIITHE HIGHLANDS OF EAST AFRICA'Colour' is already the dominant question at Nairobi. 'We mean to makeEast Africa a white man's country,' cries, in strident tones, theColonists' Association on every occasion. Truly a respectable andimpressive policy; but one which seems, at first sight, ratherdifficult to achieve in a land where there are, so far, fewer than twothousand five hundred whites and more than four million blackaboriginals. Can East Africa ever become a white man's country? Caneven the Highlands, with their cool and buoyant breezes and temperate,unchanging climate, become a white man's country? Never, certainly, inthe sense that Canada, or, indeed, the United Kingdom, are white men'scountries--that is to say, countries inhabited wholly by white peopleand subsisting upon an economic basis of white unskilled labour.It is scarcely worth while even to imagine the Highlands of EastAfrica denuded of their native inhabitants and occupied solely byEuropeans. Such an idea is utterly impossible. Whatever may be theincrease in the white population in the future, it is safe to say thatit will be far more than counter-balanced by the multiplication of thenatives, as they are guarded against famine and prevented from civilwar. But were such a solution possible, it would be almost the lastthing in the world desired by those who clamour for 'a white man'scountry.' For observe it is not against the black aboriginal that theprejudices and interests of the white settler or trader are arrayed.The African, it is conceded, is welcome to stay in his own country. Noeconomic competition has yet arisen or is likely to arise between himand the new-comers. Their spheres of activity lie wholly apart, forthe white man absolutely refuses to do black man's work; not for thatharsh toil does he exile himself from the land of his birth; while thenative could not, in his present state of development, displace thewhite man in skilled employments and the superintendence and theorganization of industry--even if he would--and nothing is fartherfrom his ambitions.It is the brown man who is the rival. The European has neither thewish nor the power to constitute a white proletariat in countries likeEast Africa. In his view the blacks should be the private soldiers ofthe army, but the non-commissioned officers and the commanders must bewhite. This should not be dismissed as a mere assertion of racialarrogance. It is an obstinate fact. It is already a grave defect for acommunity to found itself upon the manual labour of an inferior race,and many are the complications and perils that spring therefrom. Butwhat of the second storey? If there is to be any kind of white societydwelling together year after year within the standards of life andcomfort to which Europeans have universally been accustomed to aspire,and largely to attain, this middle stage in the economic system mustprovide that white society with the means of earning--as professionalmen, as planters, merchants, traders, farmers, bankers, overseers,contractors, builders, engineers, accountants, clerks--a living forthemselves and their families. And here strikes in the Asiatic. Inevery single employment of this class, his power of subsisting upon afew shillings a month, his industry, his thrift, his sharp businessaptitudes give him the economic superiority, and if economicsuperiority is to be the final rule--as it has never been and neverwill be in the history of the world--there is not a single employmentof this middle class, from which he will not, to a very large extent,clear the white man, as surely and as remorselessly as the brown ratextirpated the black from British soil.Then what remains? What sort of social organizations shall we bebuilding up with so much thought and labour in these new lands underthe British Crown? There is already no white working class. There isto be no white middle class. Room is left only for the capitalist_pure and simple_--if one may so describe him. A vast army of Africanlabourers, officered by educated Indians or Chinese, and directed by afew individuals of diverse nationalities employing cosmopolitancapital--that is the nightmare which haunts the white population ofSouth Africa, and at which what there is of a white population in EastAfrica is already shrieking vigorously.Yet hear the other side. How stands the claim of the British Indian?His rights as a human being, his rights as a British subject, areequally engaged. It was the Sikh soldier who bore an honourable partin the conquest and pacification of these East African countries. Itis the Indian trader who, penetrating and maintaining himself in allsorts of places to which no white man would go or in which no whiteman could earn a living, has more than any one else developed the earlybeginnings of trade and opened up the first slender means ofcommunication. It was by Indian labour that the one vital railway onwhich everything else depends was constructed. It is the Indian bankerwho supplies perhaps the larger part of the capital yet available forbusiness and enterprise, and to whom the white settlers have nothesitated to recur for financial aid. The Indian was here long beforethe first British official. He may point to as many generations ofuseful industry on the coast and inland as the white settlers--especiallythe most recently-arrived contingents from South Africa (the loudestagainst him of all)--can count years of residence. Is it possible forany Government with a scrap of respect for honest dealing between manand man, to embark upon a policy of deliberately squeezing out thenative of India from regions in which he has established himself underevery security of public faith? Most of all must we ask, is such apolicy possible to the Government which bears sway over three hundredmillions of our Indian Empire?We are in presence of one of those apparently hopeless antagonisms ofinterests which baffle and dispirit all who are concerned in theiradjustment. And these questions are not confined to East Africa or toSouth Africa. A whole series of new problems has arisen, and will growgraver and larger as the immediate history of the British Empireunfolds. They erect themselves upon a field almost wholly unstudied,and familiar only by the prejudices which in every direction obstructmovement and view. The entry of the Asiatic as labourer, trader, andcapitalist into competition in industry and enterprise not only_with_, but _in_, the Western world is a new fact of first importance.Cheap, swift, easy means of communication, the establishment of peaceand order over land and sea, the ever-growing inter-dependence of allmen and all countries upon one another, have given wings to Asiaticcommercial ambition and rendered Asiatic manual labour fluid, as ithas never before been fluid since the beginning of things.Unless these new elements in the economic life of mankind can bescientifically and harmoniously controlled and assimilated, great andnovel dangers menace alike the Asiatic and the European he supplants.On the one hand we see the possible exploitation under variousunhealthy conditions of immense masses of Asiatic labour, to the moralinjury of the employer and to the degradation and suffering of theemployed; on the other the overturn of the standards of livinglaboriously achieved or long obstinately battled for among Europeans.Superadded to these we must foresee the confusion of blood, ofmanners, of morals, amounting, where operative upon any extensivescale, almost to the disintegration of the existing order of society.And behind--very close behind--lie the appeals to force, by mobs orEmpires, to decide in a brutal fashion the brutal question which oftwo sets of irreconcilable interests shall prevail. It is not easy tomeasure the degree of political instability that will be introducedinto international relations, when the subjects of a powerfulmilitary and naval State are continually exposed to penal legislationand open violence, and into private life when the white artisan isinvited to acquiesce in his own extinction, in virtue of laws which hehimself controls, by a competitor whom, he believes, he could strikedown with his hands.Yet the Asiatic, and here I also include the African native, hasimmense services to render and energies to contribute to the happinessand material progress of the world. There are spacious lands whosepromise can never be realized, there are unnumbered harvests which cannever be garnered, without his active co-operation. There are roadsand railways and reservoirs which only he can make. There are minesand forests which will slumber for ever without his aid. The mightycontinent of tropical Africa lies open to the colonizing andorganizing capacities of the East. All those new products which modernindustry insistently demands are offered in measureless abundance tothe West--if only we could solve the Sphinx's riddle in its newestform.And is it after all beyond our reach to provide, if not a perfect, atany rate a practical answer? There ought to be no insuperabledifficulty, in the present state of political knowledge and socialorganization, in assigning different spheres to the external activityof different races. The Great Powers have partitioned Africaterritorially; is it beyond the wit of man to divide it economically?The co-operation of many different kinds of men is needed for thecultivation of such a noble estate. Is it impossible to regulate infull and intricate detail the conditions under which that co-operationshall take place? Here white men can live and thrive; there theycannot. Here is a task for one, there the opportunity of another. Theworld is big enough. [I write as the stream of the Nile bears mebetween the immense spaces of beautiful, fertile, unpopulated countrythat lie north of the Albert Lake.] There is plenty of room for all.Why cannot we settle it fairly?It must be noted that the question of Asiatic immigration presentsitself to the Imperial point of view in several quite distinct forms.There are, first of all, colonies which stand on the basis of a whiteproletariat, and whose inhabitants, rich and poor, employers andemployed, are all Europeans. The right of such colonies to forbid theentry of large numbers of Asiatics, and to preserve themselves fromthe racial chaos and economic disturbance inseparable from suchimmigration, cannot be denied, although its exercise ought no doubt tobe governed by various prudential and other considerations. But thesecolonies differ markedly from those where the mass of the populationis not white, but black. Again, there are colonies which possessresponsible government, and where the number of the white middle-classinhabitants very largely exceeds the Asiatic community. It is evidentthat these stand in a wholly different position from that of placeslike the tropical Protectorates of East and West Africa.Indeed, it may be contended that the very fact that the native ofBritish India will undoubtedly, wisely or unwisely, rightly orwrongly, be refused access in any large numbers to several SouthAfrican and all Australian Colonies by their respective Governments,makes it all the more desirable that the Imperial Government shouldafford in the tropical Protectorates outlet and scope to theenterprise and colonizing capacity of Hindustan. And, as I havewritten, these countries are big enough for all. There is no reasonwhy those Highland areas which promise the white man a home and acareer, and where alone he can live in comfort, should not, as amatter of practical administration, be in the main reserved for him.Nor, on the other hand, why the Asiatic, if only he does not teach theAfrican natives evil ways--a contingency which must not beforgotten--should not be encouraged to trade and settle as he will inthe enormous regions of tropical fertility to which he is naturallyadapted. Somewhere in this direction--I do not wish to dogmatize--theimmediate course of sound policy would seem to lie, and, guided by thelights of science and tolerance, we may easily find it.But the course of these reflections has carried me a good deal fartherthan the politics of Nairobi would seem to justify; and I hasten toreturn to the question with which I started: 'Can the Highlands ofEast Africa be made 'a white man's country'?' Let us examine this by afresh process. As one rides or marches through the valleys and acrossthe wide plateaux of these uplands, braced by their delicious air,listening to the music of their streams, and feasting the eye upontheir natural wealth and beauty, a sense of bewilderment overcomes themind. How is it they have never become the home of some superior race,prosperous, healthy, and free? Why is it that, now a railway hasopened the door and so much has been published about them, there hasnot been one furious river of immigration from the cramped andinsanitary jungle-slums of Europe? Why, most of all, are those whohave come--the pioneers, the men of energy and adventure, of largeambitions and strong hands--why are they in so many cases only justkeeping their heads above water? Why should complaint and discontentand positive discouragement be so general among this limited class?I have always experienced a feeling of devout thankfulness never tohave possessed a square yard of that perverse commodity called 'land.'But I will confess that, travelling in the East African Highlands forthe first time in my life, I have learned what the sensation ofland-hunger is like. We may repress, but we cannot escape, the desireto peg out one of these fair and wide estates, with all the rewardsthey offer to industry and inventiveness in the open air. Yet allaround are men possessing thousands of fertile acres, with mountainsand rivers and shady trees, acquired for little or nothing, allstruggling, all fretful, nervous, high-strung, many disappointed, somedespairing, some smashed.What are the true lineaments concealed behind the veil of boundlesspromise in which this land is shrouded? Are they not stamped withmockery? Is not the eye that regards you fierce as well as bright?'When I first saw this country,' said a colonist to me, 'I fell inlove with it. I had seen all the best of Australia. I had prospered inNew Zealand. I knew South Africa. I thought at last I had struck'God's own country.' I wrote letters to all my friends urging them tocome. I wrote a series of articles in the newspapers praising thesplendours of its scenery and the excellence of its climate. Beforethe last of the articles appeared my capital was nearly expended, myfences had been trampled down by troops of zebra, my imported stockhad perished, my title-deeds were still blocked in the Land Office,and I myself had nearly died of a malignant fever. Since then I haveleft others to extol the glories of East Africa.'These second thoughts err, no doubt, as much on the side ofextravagant depression as the first impression was over-sanguine. Butthat there is a rude reverse to the East African medal is a fact whichcannot be disputed, and which ought not, in the interests either ofthe immigrant or of the country to be concealed. It is still quiteunproved that a European can make even the Highlands of East Africahis permanent home--that is to say, that he can live there withoutsensible degeneration for fifteen or twenty years at a stretch withoutever returning to the temperate zones; still less that he can breedand rear families through several generations. The exhilaration of theair must not lead people to forget that an altitude of from five toeight thousand feet above the sea-level is an unusual condition,producing results, not yet ascertained, upon the nervous system, thebrain, and the heart. Its coolness can never remove the fact that weare upon the Equator. Although the skies look so familiar and kindlywith their white fleecy clouds and passing showers, the direct ray ofthe sun--almost vertical at all seasons of the year--strikes down onman and beast alike, and woe to the white man whom he findsuncovered! Although sheep and oxen multiply so rapidly, althoughcrossing them with imported stock produces in each generationastonishing improvements in quality, they are subject to many perilslittle understood and often fatal. And if the landscape recalls to thepensive traveller the peaceful beauties of gentler climes at home, lethim remember that it nurses with blithe fecundity poisonous reptiles,and pest-spreading insects, and terrible beasts of prey.There is no reason, however, for doubting that modern sciencepossesses, or will discover, the means of eradicating or mitigatingmany of these evils. As the development of the country and thescientific investigation of tropical agriculture and tropical diseaseproceed, the difficulties which beset the early settler will graduallybe removed. He will learn how to clothe and house himself; what toplant, what to breed, and what to avoid. The spread of East Coastfever, now carried by the ticks from one animal to another, andcarried by the infected animals from one district to another, will bearrested, and controlled by a proper system of wire-fencing andquarantine. Remedies will be discovered against the various diseaseswhich attack sheep or horses. Zebra, rhinoceros, buffalo, and otherpicturesque and fascinating nuisances will be driven from orexterminated within the settled areas, and confined to the amplereserves of uninhabited land. The slow but steady growth of a whitepopulation will create a market for local agricultural produce. Thepowerfully equipped Scientific Departments, the Veterinary andForestry Departments, and the Department of Agriculture newlyestablished on a considerable scale, will be able to guide and assistthe enterprise of the new-comer, and save him from repeating theill-starred experiments of the pioneer. Roads will improve, andrailways and mono-rail tramways will extend. Step by step life and themeans of living will become easier and more secure. Still it will notbe proved that the pure-bred European can rear his children under theEquatorial sun and at an elevation of more than six thousand feet; andtill that is proved 'the white man's country' will remain a whiteman's dream.I have written of Europeans and Asiatics. What of the African? Aboutfour millions of these dark folk are comprised within the districtsof the East Africa Protectorate which are actually or partiallyadministered. Many more lie beyond those wide and advancingboundaries. What is to be their part in shaping the future of theircountry? It is, after all, _their_ Africa. What are they going to dofor it, and what is it going to do for them? 'The natives,' says theplanter, 'evince a great reluctance to work, especially to workregularly.' 'They must be made to work,' say others. 'Made to work forwhom?' we innocently ask. 'For us, of course,' is the ready answer;'what did you think we meant?' And here we run into another herd ofrhinoceros questions--awkward, thick-skinned, and horned, with a shortsight, an evil temper, and a tendency to rush blindly up wind upon anyalarm. Is the native idle? Does he not keep himself and pay his taxes?Or does he loll at his ease while his three or four wives till thesoil, bear the burden, and earn his living? And if idle, has he aright to remain idle--a naked and unconscious philosopher, living 'thesimple life,' without cares or wants,--a gentleman of leisure in apanting world? Is that to be the last word? Is civilization to saydefinitely that when the African native has kept himself, or made hiswomen keep him, she has no further claim upon him? The white man shalldo the rest. He shall preserve the peace, that the tribes may prosperand multiply. His watchful and foreseeing eye, strained and weary withthe effort, shall still make provision against famine; his science,though he himself goes down in the struggle, shall grapple withpestilence and cure disease. Far from his home or from his family heshall hew the trees and dig the wells, shall dam the streams and buildthe roads, with anxious heart and 'in the sweat of his brow,'according to the curse laid upon the child of many wants, while thechild of few wants watches him from the shade and thinks him mad.And to compare the life and lot of the African aboriginal--secure inhis abyss of contented degradation, rich in that he lacks everythingand wants nothing--with the long nightmare of worry and privation, ofdirt and gloom and squalour, lit only by gleams of torturing knowledgeand tantalizing hope, which constitutes the lives of so many poorpeople in England and Scotland, is to feel the ground tremble underfoot. 'It would never do to have a lot of 'mean whites' in thiscountry,' I heard one day a gentleman say. 'It would destroy therespect of the native for the white man, if he saw what miserablepeople we have got at home.' So here, at any rate, the boot is on theother leg, and Civilization is ashamed of her arrangements in thepresence of a savage, embarrassed lest he should see what lies behindthe gold and purple robe of State, and begin to suspect that theall-powerful white man is a fraud. But this is an irrelevancy!I am clearly of opinion that no man has a right to be idle, whoever hebe or wherever he lives. He is bound to go forward and take an honestshare in the general work of the world. And I do not except theAfrican native. To a very much larger extent than is often recognizedby some who discuss these questions, the natives are industrious,willing to learn, and capable of being led forward. Live for a fewweeks, as I have done, in close association with the disciplinedsoldiers of the King's African Rifles, or with the smart sailors ofthe Uganda Marine, and it seems wonderful to contrast them with thepopulation from which they have emerged. How strong, how good-natured,how clever they are! How proud their white officers are of them! Whatpains they take to please the travellers whom they escort; how franklythey are delighted by a word of praise or thanks! Just and honourablediscipline, careful education, sympathetic comprehension, are all thatis needed to bring a very large proportion of the native tribes ofEast Africa to a far higher social level than that at which they nowstand. And why should men only be taught to be soldiers? Is war alwaysto have the best of everything? Cannot peaceful industry be made asattractive, be as highly organized, as carefully studied as thecombined use of deadly weapons? 'Why,' as Ruskin asks, 'cannot mentake pride in _building_ villages instead of only _carrying_ them?'I wonder why my pen slips off into these labyrinths, when all I setout to do was to give some general idea of politics at Nairobi? But intruth the problems of East Africa are the problems of the world. Wesee the social, racial, and economic stresses which rack modernsociety already at work here, but in miniature; and if we choose tostudy the model when the whole engine is at hand, it is because on thesmaller scale we can see more clearly, and because in East Africa andUganda the future is still uncompromised. The British Government hasit in its hands to shape the development and destiny of these newcountries and their varied peoples with an authority and from anelevation far superior to that with which Cabinets can cope with thegiant tangles at home. And the fact stirs the mind. But by this timethe reader will have had as much of East African politics as I hadwhen, after three days of deputations and disputations, the trainsteamed out of Nairobi to take us to the Great Lake and beyond.
ESTP	 IVTHE GREAT LAKEWe are off again on the Uganda Railway. Interesting and beautiful asis the country through which the line passes from Mombasa to Nairobi,it is surpassed by the magnificent scenery of the journey to the Lake.First in order and in rank is the Great Rift. This curious fault inthe earth's surface, which geologists trace across the four thousandmiles of land and sea which separate us from Palestine, and onwardstill to the southern end of Lake Tanganyika, is traversed by theUganda Railway at one of its most remarkable stages. For sixty milesthe Highland plateau has been rising steadily by a succession ofwooded undulations to a level of over six thousand feet. Now it fallsabruptly, almost precipitously, more than two thousand feet. Thisfrowning wall of rock and forest, which extends straight as a rulerfarther than eye can see, is the Kikuyu Escarpment. As the trainclaws its way downwards by slant and zigzag along its face, a majesticpanorama breaks upon the view. Far below, bathed in sunshine,stretching away to misty purple horizons, lie the broad expanses ofthe Rift Valley. Its level surface is broken by strangely mouldedvolcanic hills and shattered craters. The opposite mountain wall loomsup in the far distance, brown and blue. We gaze down upon the plain asfrom a balloon, mistaking forests for patches of green grass, andmighty trees for thorn-scrub.  [Illustration: THE RIFT VALLEY FROM THE KIKUYU ESCARPMENT.]Another hour or so and Lake Naivasha comes into view. This sheet ofwater is about ten miles square, and the rim of a submerged cratermakes an odd, crescent-shaped island in its midst. Its brackish watersrepel the inhabitants, but afford shelter to numberless wild-fowl andmany hippopotami. At Naivasha there is the Government stock farm. Onemay see in their various flocks the native sheep, the half-bredEnglish, the three-quarter-bred, etc. The improvement is amazing. Thenative sheep is a hairy animal, looking to the unpractised eye morelike a goat than a sheep. Crossed with Sussex or Australian blood,his descendant is transformed into a woolled beast of familiaraspect. At the next cross the progeny is almost indistinguishable fromthe pure-bred English in appearance, but better adapted to the Africansun and climate. It is the same with cattle. In the first generationthe hump of the African ox vanishes. In the second he emerges arespectable British Shorthorn. The object of this farm is twofold:first, to find the type best adapted to local conditions; secondly, tosupply the settlers and the natives with a steadily broadeningfountain of good blood by which their flocks and herds may be trebledand quadrupled in value. The enthusiasm and zeal of those in charge ofthis work were refreshing. At present, however, their operations arerestricted by insufficient funds and by the precautions which must betaken against East Coast fever. The first of these impediments may beremoved; the second is less tractable.East Coast fever came across the German border a year and a half ago,and since then, in spite of such preventive measures as our scantymeans allow, it has been gradually and slowly spreading through theProtectorate. A diseased cow may take thirty days to die. In themeantime wherever it goes the swarming ticks are infected. They holdtheir poison for a year. If, during that time, other cattle pass overthe ground the ticks fasten upon them and inoculate them with thesickness. And each new victim wanders off to spread the curse to newticks, who cast it back to new cattle, and so on till the end of thestory. At each point fresh areas of ground become distempered, andfresh cows begin to drop off one by one, leaving their evilinheritance to the ravening insects.  [Illustration: GOVERNMENT FARM AT NAIVASHA.]So here we see the two principles of Nature at worksimultaneously--the blood-stock rams and bulls spreading theirhealthy, fruitful life in ever-widening circles through the land; theinfected cattle carrying their message of death in all directions.Every point that either attains, becomes at once a new centre ofvitality or dissolution. Both processes march deliberately forward tolimitless multiplications. The native is helpless in the face ofadvancing ruin. Left to itself the evil would assuredly devour thegood, till the cattle were exterminated and the sickness starved todeath for lack of prey. But at this moment the white biped withfaculties of ratiocination intervenes from the tin-roofed Departmentof Agriculture; discovers, for instance, that ground may be purifiedby putting upon it sheep, into whom the ticks discharge their poisonharmlessly and are thereafter purged; erects hundreds of miles of wirefencing to cut the country up into compartments, as a warship isdivided by bulkheads; encloses infected areas; destroys suspectedanimals; searches methodically and ever more hopefully forprophylactics and remedies; with one hand arrests the curse, with theother speeds the blessing, and in so doing is surely dischargingrather an important function from a good many points of view.My friends and I took four days in travelling to the Victoria Nyanza,although the distance can be covered in twenty-four hours; for weturned aside every day for sport or business, while our train waitedobligingly in a siding. Of the latter, indeed, there was no lack, forthe Governor and the heads of several departments were in the train,and we laboured faithfully together at many prickly things. Then atthe stations came farmers, surveyors, and others, with words ofwelcome or complaint, and a deputation of Boer settlers with manyexpressions of loyalty to the Crown, and the chiefs of the Lumbwa andNandi tribes, with a crowd of warriors, and their Laibon with his fourwives, all in a row, till I was as tired of making 'brief andappropriate' speeches as my companions must have been of hearing them.  [Illustration: THE LAIBON'S WIVES.]  [Illustration: RAILHEAD AT KISUMU.]But Elmenteita was all holiday. Lord Delamere met us at the stationwith Cape carts, ponies, and hog-spears, and we drove off in search ofpig over an enormous plain thickly peopled with antelope and gazelle.I cannot pretend to the experience of both countries necessary tocompare the merits of pig-sticking in India and in East Africa inrespect of the fighting qualities of the animal, nor the ground overwhich he is pursued. But I should think the most accomplished memberof the Meerut Tent Club would admit that the courage and ferocity ofthe African wart-hog, and the extreme roughness of the country, heapedas it is with boulders and pitted with deep ant-bear holes concealedby high grass, make pig-sticking in East Africa a sport which wouldwell deserve his serious and appreciative attention. At present it isin its infancy, and very few even of the officers of the King'sAfrican Rifles can boast the proficiency of the Indian expert.But everything in East Africa is at its first page; and besides,the wart-hog is, at present at any rate, regarded as dangerousvermin who does incredible damage to native plantations, and whosedestruction--by any method, even the most difficult--is useful as wellas exciting.Our first pig was a fine fellow, who galloped off with his tailstraight up in the air and his tusks gleaming mischievously, andafforded a run of nearly three miles before he was killed. The risk ofthe sport consists in this--that the pig cannot be overtaken andeffectively speared except by a horse absolutely at full gallop. Theground is so trappy that one hardly cares to take one's eyes off itfor a moment. Yet during at least a hundred yards at a time the wholeattention of the rider must be riveted on the pig, within a few yardsof whom he is riding, and who may be expected to charge at any second.A fall at such a climax is necessarily very dangerous, as the wart-hogwould certainly attack the unhorsed cavalier; yet no one can avoid thechance. I do not know whether Anglo-India will shudder, but I shouldcertainly recommend the intending hunter in East Africa to strap arevolver on his thigh in case of accidents. 'You do not want itoften,' as the American observed; 'but when you do, you want itbadly.'We passed a jolly morning riding after these brutes and shooting a few_Gazella Granti_ and _Gazella Thomsoni_, or 'Grants' and 'Tommies' asthey are familiarly called, and in looking for eland in the intervals.At the end of Lake Elmenteita, a beautiful sheet of water, unhappilybrackish, a feast had been prepared, to which a number of gentlemenfrom Lord Delamere's estates and the surrounding farms had beenbidden. A long array of flocks and herds was marshalled on both sidesof the track in due order, native-bred, half-bred, three-quarter-bred,pure. Through these insignia of patriarchal wealth, which would haveexcited the keenest interest in any traveller less hungry and moreinstructed in such matters than I, we made our way to an excellentluncheon, which, be sure, was not unaccompanied by the usualdiscussion on East African politics.It was late in the afternoon when we started back to the train, whichlay eight miles off in a siding. On the way we fell in with a mostfierce and monstrous pig, who led us a nice dance through bush andgrass and boulder. As he emerged into a patch of comparatively smooth,open ground I made up my mind to spear him, urged my pony to her topspeed, and was just considering how best to do the deed when, withoutthe slightest provocation, or, at any rate, before he had been evenpricked, the pig turned sharp round and sprang at me, as if he were aleopard. Luckily, my spear got in the way, and with a solid jar, whichmade my arm stiff for a week, drove deep into his head and neck beforeit broke, so that he was glad to sheer off with eighteen inches of itsticking in him, and after a dash at my companion he took refuge in adeep hole, from which no inducements or insults could draw him.Later we rode and killed another pig and chased a fourthunsuccessfully, and it was nearly dark before the railway was reached.As I was getting into my carriage they calmly told me that _six lions_had walked across the line a quarter of a mile away and a quarter ofan hour before. A settler who had been to lunch at Elmenteita wasloading a hastily-borrowed revolver before starting on his homewardride to Nakuru, and as I gave him some cartridges, I reflected that,whatever may be the shortcomings of East Africa, the absence of aninteresting and varied fauna is certainly not among them.Next day our train is climbing through dense and beautiful forests tothe summit of the Mau Escarpment. Admiration of the wealth andsplendour of the leafy kingdom is mingled with something very like aweat its aggressive fertility. The great trees overhang the line. Thecreepers trail down the cuttings, robing the red soil with cloaks offlowers and foliage. The embankments are already covered. Everyclearing is densely overgrown with sinuous plants. But for theceaseless care with which the whole line is scraped and weeded itwould soon become impassable. As it is, the long fingers of theencroaching forest are everywhere stretching out enviously towards thebright metals. Neglect the Uganda Railway for a year, and it wouldtake an expedition to discover where it had run.At Nyoro station nearly nine hundred natives were at work cuttingtimber for the railway, which is entirely dependent on wood fuel. Thecontractor in charge, a young English gentleman, who was described tome as being a model employer of native labour in Government contracts,had taken the trouble to cut a path through the forest across a loopof the line in order that I might see what it was like inside. Throughthis leafy tunnel, about a mile and a half long, we all accordinglydived. There was nothing sinister in the aspect of this forest, forall its density and confusion. The great giants towered upmagnificently to a hundred and fifty feet. Then came the ordinaryforest trees, much more thickly clustered. Below this again was alayer of scrub and bushes; and under, around, and among the wholeflowed a vast sea of convolvulus-looking creeper. Through all thisfour-fold veil the sunlight struggled down every twenty yards or so ingleaming chequers of green and gold.On the way the method of fuel-cutting is explained. So far as thelabourer is concerned, it is an elaborate system of piece-work, veryaccurately and fairly adjusted, and, as is so often the case where thewhite employer takes personal care of his men, there appeared to be nodifficulty in finding any number of natives. But they are a plagueycompany. Few will stay for more than a month or two, howeversatisfied they may be with their work and its rewards; and just asthey begin to get skilful, off they go to their villages to cultivatetheir gardens and their families, promising to come back another year,or after the harvest, or at some other remote and indefinite date. Andmeanwhile the railway must have its fuel every day and day after day,with the remorseless monotony of the industrial machine.But what a way to cut fuel! A floating population of clumsy barbarianspecking at the trees with native choppers more like a toy hoe than anaxe, and carrying their loads when completed a quarter of a mile ontheir heads to the wood-stack, while the forest laughs at thefeebleness of man. I made a calculation. Each of the nine hundrednatives employed costs on the whole six pounds a year. The price of asteam tree-felling plant, with a mile of mono-rail tram complete, isabout five hundred pounds. The interest and sinking fund on thiscapital outlay represent the wages of four natives, to which must beadded the salary of a competent white engineer, equal to the wage offorty natives, and the working expenses and depreciation roughlyestimated at the wage of twenty natives more; in all the wage ofsixty-five natives. Such a plant, able to cut trees six feet indiameter through in four or five minutes, to cut timber as well asfuel, to saw it into the proper lengths for every purpose with theutmost rapidity, and to transport it by whole truck-loads when sawn tothe railway siding, would accomplish a week's work of the sixty-fivenatives it replaced in a single day, and effect a sevenfoldmultiplication of power. It is no good trying to lay hold of TropicalAfrica with naked fingers. Civilization must be armed with machineryif she is to subdue these wild regions to her authority. Iron roads,not jogging porters; tireless engines, not weary men; cheap power, notcheap labour; steam and skill, not sweat and fumbling: there lies theonly way to tame the jungle--more jungles than one.On this we talked--or at least I talked--while we scrambled across thestumps of fallen trees or waded in an emerald twilight from onesunbeam to another across the creeper flood. It is of vital importancethat these forests should not be laid waste by reckless andimprovident hands. It is not less important that the Uganda Railwayshould have cheap fuel. For a long time fuel alone was the object, butnow that an elaborate Forestry Department has been established on themost scientific lines, there is a danger that forestry will be theonly object, and the cost of fuel so raised by regulations, admirablein themselves, that the economy of the Uganda Railway may be impaired.And let us never forget that the Uganda Railway is the driving-wheelof the whole concern. What is needed here, as elsewhere, is aharmonious compromise between opposite and conflicting interests. Thatis all.Presently our guide began to tell us of the strange creatures who livein the forest, and are sometimes seen quite close by thefuel-cutters--very rare antelope, enormous buffaloes, and astonishingbirds and butterflies beyond imagination. He had managed to makefriends with the Wandorobo--a tribe of forest-dwelling natives wholive plunged in these impenetrable shades, who are so shy that, ifonce a stranger does but set eye upon their village, forthwith theyabandon it; yet who are at the same time so teased by curiosity thatthey cannot resist peeping, peeping ever nearer and nearer to thefuel-cutters, until one day commercial relations are established onthe basis of sugar for skins. I was just becoming interested in thesewood-squirrels when we broke into the hot blaze of the noonday sunbeating down on the polished railway track, and had to climb up on toour cowcatcher in order to hurry on to a real steam saw-mill ten milesfarther up the line.As the journey advances, the train mounts steadily higher and theaspect of the country changes. The forest, which has hitherto lappedthe line closely on every side, now makes fair division with rollinghills of grass. And there is this extraordinary feature about it:where the forest areas end, they end abruptly. There is no ragged beltof trees less thickly grown; no transition. Smooth slopes of grass runup to the very edge of virgin forest, just as in England the meadowruns to the edge of the covert. The effect is to make the landscapesurprisingly homelike. It is like travelling through a series ofgigantic parks, where the hand of man has for hundreds of yearsdecided exactly where trees shall grow and where they shall not.  [Illustration: KAVIRONDO WARRIORS AT KISUMU.]Towards the west great plains are visible, in misty apparition,through rifts in the plateau. At length we arrive at the summit of theescarpment, and stop for luncheon by an indicator, which registerseight thousand two hundred and ninety feet above the sea-level.Southward rises a hill perhaps five hundred feet above us, from thetop of which the waters of the Great Lake can be seen, like the watersof a distant ocean.Geographically we have now reached the culminating point in this longjourney. Henceforward, to find our way home, we have only to descend,guided by the force of gravity, first swiftly along the railroad tothe Victoria Lake, then sedately with the stream of the Nile to theMediterranean. The lofty table-lands of East Africa, with their crisp,chill air and English aspect, must now be left behind--not withoutmany regrets--and the traveller will alight upon a middle world spreadat a level of about four thousand feet, in which an entirely differentorder of conditions prevails. Downward then at thirty miles an hour,along the side of spacious valleys, around the shoulders of the hills,across thin-spun iron bridges, through whose girders one glances downat torrents flashing far below, onward to the Lake. Within an hour thetemperature has sensibly altered. An overcoat is no longer necessary,even if you ride in front of the engine. In two hours the climate iswarm and damp with the steamy heat of the Tropics. The freshness hasgone out of the air, and in its place is that sense of sultryoppression which precedes the thunderstorms so common at this seasonof the year.In order to avoid a hot night on the Lake shore we stopped at FortTernan, a placeless name, some forty miles from Kisumu, and rathermore than a thousand feet above it. And here the storm which had beenbrooding all the afternoon over the western face of the Mau Escarpmentburst upon us. Even after ten months on the South African veldt I wasastonished by its fury. For nearly two hours the thunder crashed androared in tremendous peals--     'Like water flung from some high crag,     The lightning fell with never a jag,         A river steep and wide,'while the rain dashed down in sheets of water, one single gust ofwhich would drench you to the skin. But our train is an effectiveshelter. We dine comfortably in the midst of the tempest, andafterwards in a cooler atmosphere look up towards repentant stars anda tear-stained sky.At dawn we are at Kisumu. There is a stir of men, a crowded platform,soldiers in order, groups of Indian traders, hundreds of Kavirondonatives in their fullest undress, bunting, and introductions. Largewhite steamers lie alongside the jetty, and beyond these the waters ofthe Lake gleam their broad welcome to the sunrise. Kisumu, or PortFlorence as it is sometimes called, is the western terminus of theUganda Railway and the chief port on Lake Victoria. It possesses whatI am told is the highest dockyard in the world, and is the place atwhich all the steamers now plying on the Lake have been put together.One eight-hundred-ton cargo boat is actually in process ofconstruction, and will be launched in a few months' time to meet thegrowing traffic of the Nyanza. The station itself is pretty; its trimhouses and shady trees, backed against the hills, overlook the wideexpanse of Kavirondo Bay and its encircling promontories. Unluckily,it is unhealthy, for the climate is depressing and the sewageaccumulates in the tideless and shallow inlet. Some day one of twothings will happen: either the waters of the Victoria Nyanza will beraised by a dam across the Ripon Falls and Kavirondo Bay will beproportionately deepened and cleansed, or the railway will bedeflected and prolonged to its natural terminus on the deep waters ofthe lake at Port Victoria.The Kavirondo tribe, the greatest in this part of the country, hadorganized an imposing demonstration. In dense array they lined theroad from the station to the Commissioner's house, and our partywalked through their midst in a perfect hubbub of horns and drums andshrill salutations. All the warriors carried their spears, shields,and war-paint, and most of them wore splendid plumes of ostrichfeathers. The Kavirondo are naked and unashamed. Both sexes areaccustomed to walk about in the primitive simplicity of Nature. Theirnudity is based not upon mere ignorance but reasoned policy. They havea very strong prejudice against the wearing of clothes, which theydeclare lead to immorality; and no Kavirondo woman can attire herselfeven in the most exiguous raiment without sullying her reputation.They are said to be the most moral of all the tribes dwelling on theLake shore. It is a pity that Herr Diogenes Teufelsdröckh, of theUniversity of Weissnichtwo, did not meet them in his ruggedwanderings, for they would surely have enabled him to add another pageto his monumental work on the functions of the tailor.  [Illustration: NANDI AND KAVIRONDO WARRIORS AT KISUMU.]I wake up the next morning to find myself afloat on a magnificentship. Its long and spacious decks are as snowy as those of a pleasureyacht. It is equipped with baths, electric light, and all modernnecessities. There is an excellent table, also a well-selectedlibrary. Smart bluejackets--with ebon faces--are polishing thebrasswork; dapper, white-clad British naval officers pace the bridge.We are steaming ten miles an hour across an immense sea of fresh wateras big as Scotland, and uplifted higher than the summit of Ben Nevis.At times we are in a complete circle of lake and sky, without a signof land. At others we skirt lofty coasts covered with forest andcrowned with distant blue-brown mountains, or thread our coursebetween a multitude of beautiful islands. The air is cool and fresh,the scenery splendid. We might be yachting off the coast of Cornwallin July. We are upon the Equator, in the heart of Africa, and crossingthe Victoria Nyanza, four thousand feet above the sea!
ESTP	 VTHE KINGDOM OF UGANDAThe East Africa Protectorate is a country of the highest interest tothe colonist, the traveller, or the sportsman. But the Kingdom ofUganda is a fairy tale. You climb up a railway instead of a beanstalk,and at the end there is a wonderful new world. The scenery isdifferent, the vegetation is different, the climate is different, and,most of all, the people are different from anything elsewhere to beseen in the whole range of Africa. Instead of the breezy uplands weenter a tropical garden. In the place of naked, painted savages,clashing their spears and gibbering in chorus to their tribal chiefs,a complete and elaborate polity is presented. Under a dynastic King,with a Parliament, and a powerful feudal system, an amiable, clothed,polite, and intelligent race dwell together in an organized monarchyupon the rich domain between the Victoria and Albert Lakes. Morethan two hundred thousand natives are able to read and write. Morethan one hundred thousand have embraced the Christian faith. There isa Court, there are Regents and Ministers and nobles, there is aregular system of native law and tribunals; there is discipline, thereis industry, there is culture, there is peace. In fact, I ask myselfwhether there is any other spot in the whole earth where the dreamsand hopes of the negrophile, so often mocked by results and stubbornfacts, have ever attained such a happy realization.  [Illustration: KISUMU.]Three separate influences, each of them powerful and benevolent,exercise control over the mass of the Baganda nation. First, theImperial authority, secular, scientific, disinterested, irresistible;secondly, a native Government and feudal aristocracy, corrected oftheir abuses, yet preserving their vitality; and thirdly, missionaryenterprise on an almost unequalled scale. Under the shelter of theBritish Flag, safe from external menace or internal broil, thechild-King grows to a temperate and instructed maturity. Surrounded byhis officers of State, he presides at the meetings of his council andParliament, or worships in the huge thatched cathedral which has beenreared on Namirembe Hill. Fortified in their rights, but restrainedfrom tyrannical excess, and guided by an outside power, hisfeudatories exercise their proper functions. The people, relieved fromthe severities and confusions of times not long ago, are apt to learnand willing to obey. And among them with patient energy toils a largebody of devoted Christian men of different nations, of differentChurches, but of a common charity, tending their spiritual needs,enlarging their social and moral conceptions, and advancing theireducation year by year.An elegance of manners springing from a naïve simplicity of characterpervades all classes. An elaborate ritual of friendly salutationsrelieves the monotony of the wayfarer's journey. Submission withoutservility or loss of self-respect is accorded to constitutedauthority. The natives evince an eagerness to acquire knowledge and avery high observant and imitative faculty. And then Uganda is from endto end one beautiful garden, where the staple food of the people growsalmost without labour, and where almost everything else can be grownbetter and easier than anywhere else. The planter from the bestislands in the West Indies is astonished at the richness of the soil.Cotton grows everywhere. Rubber, fibre, hemp, cinnamon, cocoa, coffee,tea, coca, vanilla, oranges, lemons, pineapples are natural or thriveon introduction. As for our English garden products, brought incontact with the surface of Uganda they simply give one wild bound ofefflorescence or fruition and break their hearts for joy. Does it notsound a paradise on earth? Approach and consider it more closely.The good ship _Clement Hill_, named after a well-known Africanexplorer, has carried us smoothly and prosperously across the northerncorner of the Victoria Nyanza, and reaches the pier of Entebbe as theafternoon draws towards its close. The first impression that strikesthe eye of the visitor fresh from Kavirondo is the spectacle ofhundreds of natives all dressed in long clean white garments whichthey wear with dignity and ease. At the landing-place a sort ofpavilion has been erected, and here come deputations from the Chamberof Commerce--a limited body of Europeans--from the Goanese community,and from the numerous Indian colony of merchants. A tonga drawn bytwo mules takes me to Government House, and from a widemosquito-proof veranda I am able to survey a truly delightfulprospect. The most beautiful plants and trees grow in profusion on allsides. Beyond a blaze of violet, purple, yellow, and crimson blossoms,and an expanse of level green lawns, the great blue lake lies in allits beauty. The hills and islands on the horizon are just beginning toflush to the sunset. The air is soft and cool. Except that the pictureactually looks more English in its character, one would imagine it wasthe Riviera. It must be too good to be true.It _is_ too good to be true. One can hardly believe that such anattractive spot can be cursed with malignant attributes. Yet what istrue of the East Africa Protectorate is even more true of Uganda. Thecontrast between appearance and reality is more striking and moreharsh. Behind its glittering mask Entebbe wears a sinister aspect.These smiling islands which adorn and diversify the scenery of thelake supported a few years ago a large population. To-day they aredesolate. Every white man seems to feel a sense of undefinableoppression. A cut will not heal; a scratch festers. In the thirdyear of residence even a small wound becomes a running sore. One day aman feels perfectly well; the next, for no apparent cause, he isprostrate with malaria, and with malaria of a peculiarly persistentkind, turning often in the third or fourth attack to blackwater fever.In the small European community at Entebbe there have been quiterecently two suicides. Whether, as I have suggested in East Africa, itbe the altitude, or the downward ray of the Equatorial sun, or theinsects, or some more subtle cause, there seems to be a solemn vetoplaced upon the white man's permanent residence in these beautifulabodes.  [Illustration: GOVERNMENT HOUSE, ENTEBBE.]There are many who advocate the abandonment of Entebbe as theadministrative capital and the restoration of the seat of Governmentto Kampala. But the expense of transferring public offices andbuildings lately erected to another site is altogether beyond theslender resources and not among the most urgent needs of the UgandaProtectorate. Great improvements have been effected recently in thesanitation of Entebbe. The bush and trees, which added so greatly toits picturesque appearance, have been ruthlessly cut down; and withthem, _mirabile dictu_, have vanished the mosquito and thesleeping-sickness tsetse-fly. Half a mile away on either side of thesettlement are groves which it might easily be death to enter; but theinhabited area is now quite clear.Besides, the general unhealthiness of the country so far as theEuropean is concerned is not local to Entebbe. It is widely spread inslightly different degrees throughout the whole of Uganda; and Kampalais certainly not exempt. Finally, there is a reason of a differentcharacter which ought to impose a final bar on any return of theImperial Government to the native city. Uganda is a native state. Muchof our success in dealing with its population arises from the factthat we work through and by the native Government. And that Governmentcould not fail to lose much, if not all, of its separate and naturalidentity if it were overwhelmed by the immediate proximity of thesupreme Administration.  [Illustration: UGANDA    Founded by permission of the War Office on the Map of Africa    No 1539.]For a new station in an almost unknown land, Entebbe certainlypresents many remarkable evidences of progress. The slopes of the lakeshore are covered with pretty villas, each standing in its ownluxuriant garden. There is an excellent golf course, and a verybright and pleasant society. Guardian over all this stands the Sikh.There are two companies of these soldiers, one at Entebbe and theother at Kampala, who, being entirely immune to local influences ofall kinds, constitute what Mr. Gladstone used to call the 'motormuscle' of Imperial authority. I have always admired the Sikh inIndia, both in his cantonments and in the field. But somehow hisgraceful military figure and grave countenance under the turban as hestands erect beside his rifle on guard over British interests sixthousand miles from the Punjab, impresses the eye and the imaginationwith an added force. He is a picked volunteer from all the Sikhregiments, who delights in Uganda, thrives under its, to him, mildersun, lives on nothing, saves his doubled pay, and returns to Indiaenriched and proud of his service across the sea. If at any timeconsiderations of expense, or the desire to obtain a completehomogeneity in the military forces of the Protectorate, should lead tothe disbandment or withdrawal of these two companies, those who takethe decision will have incurred a responsibility which few would careto share with them.So far as human force is concerned, the British power in these regionsis at present beyond challenge. No man can withstand it. But a newopponent has appeared and will not be denied. Uganda is defended byits insects. It would even seem that the arrival of the white man andthe increased movement and activity which his presence has engenderedhave awakened these formidable atoms to a realization of their powersof evil. The dreaded _Spirillum_ tick has begun to infest the roadslike a tiny footpad, and scarcely any precautions avail with certaintyagainst him. This tick is a dirty, drab-coloured creature the size andshape of a small squashed pea. When he bites an infected person hedoes not contract the Spirillum fever himself, nor does he transmit itdirectly to other persons. By a peculiarly malevolent provision ofNature this power is exercised not by him but by his descendants, whoare numbered in hundreds. So the poison spreads in an incalculableprogression. Although this fever is not fatal, it is exceptionallypainful in its course and distressing in its consequences. There arefive or six separate and successive attacks of fever, in which thetemperature of the victim may rise even to 107 degrees; andafterwards the eyes and hearing are temporarily affected by a kind offacial paralysis. Road after road has been declared infected by thisscourge, and officer after officer struck down as he moves on dutyfrom place to place. The only sure preventive seems to be thedestruction of all old grass-huts and camping-grounds, and theerection along the roads of a regular system of stone-built, properlymaintained and disinfected rest-houses, in which the traveller maytake refuge from the lurking peril. And this will have to be done.But a far more terrible shadow darkens the Uganda Protectorate. InJuly, 1901, a doctor of the Church Missionary Society Hospital atKampala noticed eight cases of a mysterious disease. Six months laterhe reported that over two hundred natives had died of it in the Islandof Buvuma, and that thousands appeared to be infected. The pestilenceswiftly spread through all the districts of the lake shore, and themortality was appalling. No one could tell where it had come from orwhat it was caused by. It resisted every kind of treatment andappeared to be universally fatal. Scientific inquiries of variouskinds were immediately set on foot, but for a long time no resultswere obtained, and meanwhile the disease ran along the coasts andislands of the great lake like fire in a high wind. By the middle of1902 the reported deaths from _Trypanosomiasis_, or 'sleepingsickness,' as it has come to be called, numbered over thirty thousand.It was still spreading rapidly upon all sides, and no clue whatever toits treatment or prevention had been obtained. It seemed certain thatthe entire population of the districts affected was doomed.On April 28th, 1903, Colonel Bruce, whose services had been obtainedfor the investigation of 'sleeping sickness' through theinstrumentality of the Royal Society, announced that he considered thedisease to be due to a kind of trypanosome, conveyed from one personto another by the bite of a species of tsetse-fly called _Glossinapalpalis_. His theory was strongly supported by the fact that thedisease appeared to be confined to the localities infested by the fly.The fly-belt also could be defined with precision, and was rarelyfound to extend more than a mile or two from water. The news thatEuropeans could no longer consider themselves immune from theinfection caused, as might be imagined, much consternation in thewhite community. Nearly everybody had been bitten by tsetses at onetime or another, but whether by this particular species when actuallyinfected, remained in suspense. Moreover, tsetse-flies abounded insuch numbers on all parts of the lake shore that their wholesaledestruction seemed quite impossible. What then?For a time Colonel Bruce's discovery almost paralyzed all preventiveand restrictive measures. The scourge fell unchecked. By the end of1903 the reported deaths numbered over ninety thousand, and the lakeshores were becoming fast depopulated. Whole villages were completelyexterminated, and great tracts in Usoga, which had formerly been famedfor their high state of cultivation, relapsed into forests. Theweakness of the victims and the terror or apathy of the survivorspermitted a sudden increase in the number of leopards, and thesefierce animals preyed with daring and impunity upon the living, thedying, and the dead.Further investigations, which were anxiously pushed on in manydirections, revealed the existence of the tsetse-fly over widespreadareas. In the interior of Usoga, on the banks of many rivers, inswamps on the shores of the Albert Lake and Lake Albert Edward, theseswarming emissaries of death were found to be awaiting their message.All that was needed to arm them with their fatal power was the arrivalof some person infected with the microbe. The Albert shores andseveral parts of the Upper Nile soon became new centres of pestilence.Thousands of deaths occurred in Unyoro. By the end of 1905considerably more than two hundred thousand persons had perished inthe plague-stricken regions, _out of a population_ in those regions_which could not have exceeded three hundred thousand_.Any decrease in the mortality in any district up to the present timeis due, not to any diminution in the virulence of the disease, butsimply to the reduction of possible victims, owing to theextermination of the inhabitants. Buvuma, a few years ago one of themost prosperous of all the islands, contains fewer than fourteenthousand out of thirty thousand. Some of the islands in the Sessegroup have lost every soul, while in others a few moribund natives,crawling about in the last stages of the disease, are all that areleft to represent a once teeming population.'It might have been expected,' writes Sir H. Hesketh Bell, theGovernor of Uganda, to whom I am indebted for much valuableinformation on this subject, 'that, even though the negroes showedinability to grasp the theory of the transmission of disease by theagency of insects, the undeniable deadliness of the countriesbordering on the lake shore would have induced them to flee from thestricken land and to have sought in the healthier districts inland arefuge from the pestilence that was slaying them by thousands. Anextraordinary fatalism, however, seems to have paralyzed the natives,and, while deploring the sadness of their fate, they appear to haveaccepted death almost with apathy.'The police of science, although arrived late on the scene of thetragedy, were now following many converging clues. Therapeuticinvestigation into the treatment and origin of the disease,entomological examination of the resorts, habits, dangers, andlife-history of the fly, and thirdly administrative measures ofdrastic authority are now being driven sternly forward. Knowledge hasaccumulated. Fighting the sleeping sickness is like laying a vampire.To make the spell work, five separate conditions must bepresent--water, bushes, trees, the tsetse-fly (_Glossina palpalis_),and one infected person. Remove any one of these and the curse islifted. But let them all be conjoined, and the sure destruction ofevery human being in the district is only a matter of time.The Government of Uganda is now pursuing a policy based on theappreciation of these facts. Wherever it is necessary to come to thelake shores, as at Entebbe, Munyonyo, Ripon Falls, Fajao, etc., thetsetse-fly is banished or eliminated by cutting down the trees,clearing away the bush, and planting in its place the vigorous,rapid-growing _citronella_ grass, which, once firmly established,holds its own against invading vegetation. Wherever it is not possibleto clear the shores of tsetse-flies, they must be cleared ofinhabitants. And the extraordinary operation of moving entirepopulations from their old homes to new places--often against theirwill--has been actually accomplished within the last year by acombined dead-lift effort of these three tremendous forces ofGovernment which regulate from such different points of view thelives and liberties of the Baganda.It does not follow that the lake shores will have to be abandoned forever. In a very short time--some say two days, some eleven hours--theinfected tsetse is free from poison and can no longer communicate it;and once the disease has been eradicated from the population, healthypeople might return and be bitten with impunity. Nor, on the otherhand, can we hope, unless some cure capable of being applied on alarge scale can be perfected, that the mortality in the immediatefuture will sensibly diminish. For there are many thousands of personsstill affected, and for these segregation, nursing, and compassioncomprise the present resources of civilization.One thing is, however, above all things important. There must be nolosing heart. At any moment the researches which are being conductedin so many laboratories, and in which Professor Koch has taken aleading part, may produce an absolute therapeutic remedy. By theadministrative measures now vigorously enforced it is believed thatthe fatal contact between infected persons and uninfected flies,between infected flies and uninfected persons, will have beeneffectively broken. We cannot fail to learn more of the tsetse. Thehumble black horse-fly, indistinguishable to the casual observer fromharmless types, except that his wings are folded neatly like a pair ofshut scissors, instead of splaying out on either side of his back, isnow under a bright, searching, and pitiless eye. Who are his enemies?What are his dangers? What conditions are essential to his existence?What conditions are fatal or inimical? International Commissionsdiscuss him round green tables, grave men peer patiently at himthrough microscopes, active officers scour Central Africa to plot himout on charts. A fine-spun net is being woven remorselessly aroundhim. And may not man find allies in this strange implacable warfare?There are fishes which destroy mosquitoes, there are birds which preyupon flies, there are plants whose scent or presence is abhorrent orinjurious to particular forms of insect life. In what places and forhow long will the tsetse continue to fly, as he is wont, over thesmooth, gleaming water, just above the reeds and bushes, just belowthe branches of the overhanging trees? _Glossina palpalis contramundum!_  [Illustration: THE GOVERNOR WITH BAGANDA GROUP.]I have not sought to conceal the perils in describing the riches andthe beauties of Uganda. The harsh contrasts of the land, its noblepotentialities, its hideous diseases, its fecundity alike of life anddeath, are capable of being illustrated by many more facts andexamples than I can here set down. But what an obligation, what asacred duty is imposed upon Great Britain to enter the lists in personand to shield this trustful, docile, intelligent Baganda race fromdangers which, whatever their cause, have synchronized with ourarrival in their midst! And, meanwhile, let us be sure that order andscience will conquer, and that in the end John Bull will be reallymaster in his curious garden of sunshine and deadly nightshade.
ESTP	 VIKAMPALATwo days after I had arrived at Entebbe the Governor took me over toKampala. The distance between the ancient and the administrativecapital is about twenty-four miles. The road, although unmetalled,runs over such firm, smooth sandstone, almost polished by the rains,that, except in a few places, it would carry a motor-car well, and abicycle is an excellent means of progression. The Uganda Governmentmotor-cars, which are now running well and regularly, had not then,however, arrived, and the usual method was to travel by rickshaw.Mounted in this light bicycle-wheeled carriage, drawn by one manbetween the shafts and pushed by three more from behind, we were ableto make rather more than six miles an hour in very comfortable style.The rickshaw-boys, who were neatly dressed in white tunics and redcaps, were relieved every eight miles. They have their own way ofdoing business. From the moment when the travellers are seated in therickshaw and their labour begins, they embark upon an ever-varying butabsolutely interminable antiphony, which, if it exhausts their breath,serves undoubtedly to keep their spirits up. 'Burrulum,' cry thepushers; 'Huma,' says the puller. 'Burrulum,' say the pushers again,and so on over and over again for a very long time. All these chauntshave their meanings, and if the traveller is found to be heavy orknown to be ignorant of the language, he would not always becomplimented by a correct translation. The phrase I have quoted means'iron upon wood'; and its signification is that the iron of Europeanstrength and skill, however superior, yet cannot get along without thewood of native labour and endurance. With such unexceptionablesentiments no one would quarrel. Yet even these lose their flavour byrepetition, and after half an hour of 'Burrulum' and 'Huma' I wasconstrained to ask the singers whether they could not possibly manageto convey us in silence. They tried their best, but I could see theywere unhappy, and after a while, out of compassion and to improve thepace, I withdrew the ban, and the chorus was joyfully resumed in a newand more elaborate form.The manners of the Baganda are ceremonious to a degree. They welldeserve Sir Harry Johnston's description of them as 'the Japanese ofAfrica.' If you say 'Good morning' to a stranger on an English road,it is as like as not that his surprise will throw him into a postureof self-defence; but when two Baganda meet they begin to salute eachother as soon as they come within earshot. 'How are you?' cries theone. 'Who am I that you should care to know?' replies the other.'Humble though I be, yet I have dared,' rejoins the first. 'But sayfirst how are _you_,' continues the second. 'The better for the honouryou have done me,' is the answer. By this they have already passedeach other, and there is only time for the Parthian affability, 'Thehonour is mine, and I shall treasure it,' and a quavering ofdelicately-modulated, long-drawn 'A--a--a's' of contentment andgoodwill which gradually die away in the distance, leaving neither ofthem the worse circumstanced, nor the better informed. I must add,for the reader's caution, that the aforesaid dialogue is not aninvariable ritual. The phrases may be varied _ad infinitum_ to suitthe occasion; but it will suffice as an illustration of these roadsidecourtesies.  [Illustration: BAGANDA WARRIORS AT KAMPALA.]If you wish to make a Baganda perfectly happy, all you need to do isto say, 'Way wally,' which means a sort of supremely earnest 'Welldone.' The moment this talismanic expression has left your lips, thenative to whom it is addressed will probably fall on his knees, and,clasping his two hands together, will sway them from side to side, asif he were playing a concertina, while all the time his face beamswith a most benignant and compulsive smile, and he purrs, 'A--o, a--o,a--o,' as much as to say, 'My cup of joy is overflowing.' It is not inaccordance with our ideas that man should kneel to man, and one feelsuncomfortable to see it done. Yet it should not be thought that theaction, as performed by the Baganda, involves or implies anyservility. It is their good manners--and meant to be no more. Nor,once you are used to it, do they seem to lose at all in dignity. Onlythey win your heart.The road from Entebbe to Kampala passes through delicious country.Along its whole length a double avenue of rubber trees has just beenplanted, and behind these on each side are broad strips of cottonplants, looking beautiful with their yellow flowers or pinky-whitebolls. American upland cotton grown in Uganda actually commands ahigher price in the Manchester market than when it is grown in theUnited States. There appears to be practically no natural difficultyin its cultivation throughout the larger part of Uganda. A greatdevelopment is only a question of organization and--money.But I have forgotten that we have been moving swiftly along theKampala road, and now we are almost in sight of the city. Almost, butnot quite; for, to tell the truth, no one has ever seen Kampala. Thetraveller sees the Government buildings and residences neat and primon one hill; he sees the King's house and his Ministers' houses onanother. Upon a third, a fourth, or a fifth hill he may discernsuccessively the Protestant Cathedral, the Catholic Mission, and theWhite Father's Monastery. But Kampala, the home of sixty thousandpersons, is permanently invisible. The whole town is buried under theleaves of innumerable banana plantations, which afford shade andfood to its people, and amid which their huts are thickly scatteredand absolutely concealed.  [Illustration: KING DAUDI'S DRUMMERS AT KAMPALA.]  [Illustration: WATCHING THE WAR-DANCE AT KAMPALA.    (Major Jenkins, Mr. Churchill, King Daudi, Sir H. Hesketh Bell.)]We were still three miles out of this 'garden city' when the nativereception began, and we travelled for a quarter of a mile betweenlines of white-robed Baganda, all mustered by their chiefs, andclapping their hands in sign of welcome. At last our procession ofrickshaws reached a hillock by the roadside, at the top of which stooda pavilion, beautifully constructed of stout elephant grass like thinpolished canes woven together with curious art. Down from thiseminence, over a pathway strewn with rushes, came to meet us the Kingand his notables in a most imposing array. Daudi Chewa, the King orKabaka of Uganda, is a graceful, distinguished-looking little boy,eleven years old. He was simply dressed in a flowing black robe edgedwith gold, and a little white gold-rimmed cap. Around him were theCouncil of Regency; and at his right hand stood the Prime Minister,Sir Apolo Kagwar, a powerful, determined-looking man, wearing acrimson, gold-laced robe, on which shone many decorations, severalBritish war medals, and the Order of St. Michael and St. George.We all shook hands, and were then led up into the pavilion, where wetook our seats on wicker chairs and ate sweet jellies while weconversed. The King, who is being most carefully educated by anEnglish tutor, understands and speaks English quite well, but on thisoccasion he seemed too shy to say much more than 'Yes' or 'No,' in alow, sweet drawl, and this formal interview soon came to an end.The afternoon was consumed in ceremony; for the Commissioner of Ugandahad to be sworn in the rank of Governor, to which he has been latelyraised; and there was a parade of troops, in which some five or sixhundred very smart-looking soldiers took part, headed by the Kampalacompany of Sikhs. It was not until the shadows began to lengthen thatwe visited the Kabaka on the Royal Hill. He received us in hisParliament House. In this large and beautifully-constructed grassbuilding about seventy chiefs and Baganda notables were assembled. Thelittle Kabaka sat on his throne, and his subjects grouped themselvesaround and before him. We were given seats at his side, and thePrime Minister explained that the Baganda would show us the ceremonyof swearing a chief. One of the most portly and dignified of thecouncillors thereupon advanced into the centre of the room, threwhimself face downward on the ground, and poured out a torrent ofasseverations of loyalty. After a few minutes he rose and beganbrandishing his spears, chaunting his oath all the while, until he hadcreated an extraordinary appearance of passion. Finally he rushed fromthe building to go and slay the King's enemies outside. It was notuntil he returned a moment later, calm, sedate, and respectable, thatI realized, from the merry smile on his face and from the mirth of thecompany, that he was 'only pretending,' and that the ceremony wasmerely a representation given to interest us.  [Illustration: ON THE WAY TO KAMPALA.]  [Illustration: ROAD BETWEEN JINJA AND LAKE CHIOGA.]The incident is remarkable because it illustrates the rapidity withwhich the Baganda people are leaving their past behind them. Alreadythey laugh at their old selves. Ceremonies which twenty years ago hada solemn and awful significance, are to-day reproduced by thisreflective people in much the same spirit as the citizens of Coventryrevive the progress of Lady Godiva. The same thing happened at thewar-dance the next day. Two or three thousand men, naked and paintedfor war, rushed frantically to and fro to the beating of drums andbarbaric music, with every sign of earnestness and even frenzy. Yet afew minutes later they were laughing sheepishly at one another, andbowing to us like actors before the curtain, and the Prime Ministerwas making a speech to explain that this was meant to be a pageant ofthe bad old times reproduced for our benefit. Indeed, so unaccustomedto carry arms had the warriors become that not one in ten could find aspear to arm himself with, and they had to come with sticks and otherstage-properties.Even a comic element was provided in the shape of a warrior paintedall over in a ridiculous manner, and held by two others with a ropetied round his middle. This, we were told, was 'the bravest man in thearmy,' who had to be restrained lest he should rush into battle toosoon. It is not easy to convey the air of honest fun and good humourwhich pervaded these curious performances, or to measure theintellectual progress which the attitude of the Baganda towards themimplied.  [Illustration: WAR DANCE AT KAMPALA.    'The bravest man in the army.']  [Illustration: WAR DANCE AT KAMPALA.]The Kabaka gave us tea in his house. It is a comfortable Europeanbuilding, quite small and modest, but nicely furnished, and adornedwith familiar English prints and portraits of Queen Victoria and KingEdward. Gradually he got the better of his shyness, and told me thathe liked football more than anything else, and that his mathematicalstudies had advanced as far as 'G.C.M.,' initials which never fail tostir disagreeable school-day memories in my mind. He can write a verygood letter in English, rides well on a nice pony, and will probablybecome a well-educated and accomplished man. Altogether it is a verypleasing spectacle to find in the heart of Africa, and amid so muchbarbarism, squalour, and violence, this island of gentle manners andpeaceful civilization.The next day was one unending pilgrimage. I have described how Kampalalies under the leaves of the plantain groves about the slopes of manyhills. Each hill has its special occupants and purpose. Each of thedifferent Christian missions has a hill to itself, and in the bad olddays a Maxim gun was not thought at all an inappropriate aid toChristian endeavour. It would, however, be very unfair to charge themissionaries with having created the feuds and struggles whichconvulsed Uganda twelve years ago. The accident that the line ofcleavage between French and British influence was also the line ofcleavage between Catholic and Protestant converts, imparted areligious complexion to what was in reality a fierce politicaldispute. These troubles are now definitely at an end. The arrival uponthe scene of an English Catholic mission has prevented nationalrivalries and religious differences from mutually embittering oneanother. The erection of a stable Government and the removal of alldoubts about the future of Uganda have led to an entire abatement ofstrife among devoted men engaged in a noble work. Not only is therepeace among the different Christian missions themselves, but theGovernment of Uganda, so far from watching missionary enterprise withsour disfavour, is thoroughly alive to the inestimable services whichhave been and are daily being rendered by the missions to the nativepopulation, and excellent relations prevail.  [Illustration: THE WHITE FATHERS' MISSION AT KAMPALA.]  [Illustration: CHILDREN AT THE ENGLISH CATHOLIC MISSION, KAMPALA.]In duty bound I climbed one hill after another and endeavoured to makemyself acquainted with the details of mission work in Kampala. Itcomprises every form of moral and social activity. Apart from theirspiritual work, which needs no advocacy here, the missionaries haveundertaken and are now maintaining the whole educational system of thecountry. They have built many excellent schools, and thousands ofyoung Baganda are being taught to read and write in their ownlanguage. The whole country is dotted with subsidiary missionstations, each one a centre of philanthropic and Christian effort.There are good hospitals, with skilful doctors and nurses or sistersof charity, in connection with all the missions. The largest of these,belonging to the Church Missionary Society, is a model of what atropical hospital for natives ought to be. Technical education is nowbeing added to these services, and in this, it is to be hoped, theGovernment will be able to cooperate. I do not know of any other partof the world where missionary influence and enterprise have been sobeneficently exerted, or where more valuable results have beenachieved.On Namirembe Hill, where the Church Missionary Society have theirhead-quarters, a really fine cathedral, with three tall, quaint,thatched spires, has been built out of very primitive materials; andthis is almost the only building in Uganda which offers the slightestattempt at architectural display. Under the shadow of this I foundmyself on the afternoon of the 20th of November engaged in opening ahigh school for scholars who are more advanced than can be instructedin the existing establishments. A large and well-dressed audience,native and European, filled a good-sized room. The scholars crowdedtogether in a solid mass of white-dressed youths upon the floor. TheKabaka and Sir Apolo Kagwar, who has himself five sons at the school,were upon the platform. The Governor presided. The Bishop made aspeech. The schoolboys sang English songs and hymns in very good tuneand rhythm. It was astonishing to look at the map of the BritishEmpire hanging on the wall and to realize that all this was takingplace near the north-western corner of the Victoria Nyanza.  [Illustration: INTERIOR OF NAMIREMBE CATHEDRAL.]It is eight miles from Kampala to Munyonyo, its present port on thelake, and this distance we covered in rickshaws over a shocking road.Munyonyo is itself little more than a jetty and a few sheds, but itaffords a very good example of the salutary effects of cutting downthe bush and forest. Mosquitoes and tsetses have been absolutelybanished from the cleared area, and a place which a year ago was adeath-trap is now perfectly safe and healthy. Plans are now on foot tomake a new port a little farther along the coast at a point only fivemiles away from Kampala; and when this has been connected with thecapital, as it must be, by a line of mono-rail tramway, there is everyreason to expect a substantial and growing trade.The _Sir William Mackinnon_, a venerable vessel of the Uganda Marine,awaited our party, and we steamed off on the smooth waters of thelake, through an archipelago of beautiful islands--each one moreinviting than the other--and all depopulated by sleeping sickness. Allday long we voyaged in these sheltered waters, and in the evening thelights of Jinja guided us to our destination. One cannot help admiringthe luck which led Speke to his thrilling discovery of the source ofthe Nile. There are five hundred gulfs and inlets on the northernshore of Lake Victoria, and nothing distinguishes this one from therest. No current is perceptible to the ordinary mariner until within afew miles of the rapids, and although the presumption that so vast abody of fresh water would have an overflow somewhere had behind it abacking of strong probability, the explorer might have searched for ayear without finding the spot. Instead of which he drifted and paddledgently along until all of a sudden the murmur of a distant cataractand the slight acceleration in the pace of his canoe drew him to thelong-sought birthplace of the most wonderful river in the world.It was dark when we landed at Jinja, and I could not properly see thepreparations made for our reception by the local chiefs and the Indiantraders, of whom there was a considerable crowd. The darkness,otherwise a cause of disappointment, afforded the opportunity for justthe sort of brave act one so often finds a British officer ready todo. As the baggage was being landed from the steamer on to the jetty,a poor coolie slipped under his load, and in an instant was engulfedin the deep black waters below. Whereupon, as a matter of course, ayoung civilian in the Political Department jumped in after him in thedarkness and among the crocodiles, and fished him out safe and sound,an act of admirable behaviour which has since received the recognitionof the Royal Humane Society. I am not quite sure that in all parts ofAfrica so high a standard of honour and respect for the life of thehumble native would prevail.Jinja is destined to become a very important place in the futureeconomy of Central Africa. Situated at the point where the Nile flowsout of the Great Lake, it is at once on the easiest line of watercommunication with Lake Albert and the Soudan, and also where greatwater-power is available. In years to come the shores of this splendidbay may be crowned with long rows of comfortable tropical villas andimposing offices, and the gorge of the Nile crowded with factories andwarehouses. There is power enough to gin all the cotton and saw allthe wood in Uganda, and it is here that one of the principal emporiaof tropical produce will certainly be created. In these circumstancesit is a pity to handicap the town with an outlandish name. It would bemuch better to call it Ripon Falls, after the beautiful cascades whichlie beneath it, and from whose force its future prosperity will bederived.The Ripon Falls are, for their own sake, well worth a visit. The Nilesprings out of the Victoria Nyanza, a vast body of water nearly aswide as the Thames at Westminster Bridge, and this imposing riverrushes down a stairway of rock from fifteen to twenty feet deep, insmooth, swirling slopes of green water. It would be perfectly easy toharness the whole river and let the Nile begin its long and beneficentjourney to the sea by leaping through a turbine. It is possible thatnowhere else in the world could so enormous a mass of water be held upby so little masonry. Two or three short dams from island to islandacross the falls would enable, at an inconceivably small cost, thewhole level of the Victoria Nyanza--over an expanse of a hundred andfifty thousand square miles--to be gradually raised six or seven feet;would greatly increase the available water-power; would deepen thewater in Kavirondo Bay, so as to admit steamers of much largerdraught; and, finally, would enable the lake to be maintained at auniform level, so that immense areas of swampy foreshore, nowsubmerged, now again exposed, according to the rainfalls, would beconverted either into clear water or dry land, to the benefit ofman and the incalculable destruction of mosquitoes.  [Illustration: THE RIPON FALLS (Source of the Nile).]As one watches the surging waters of the Ripon Falls and endeavours tocompute the mighty energies now running to waste, but all within thereach of modern science, the problem of Uganda rises in a new form onthe mind. All this water-power belongs to the State. Ought it ever tobe surrendered to private persons? How long, on the other hand, is aGovernment, if not prepared to act itself, entitled to bar the way toothers? This question is raised in a multitude of diverse forms inalmost all the great dependencies of the Crown. But in Uganda thearguments for the State ownership and employment of the naturalresources of the country seem to present themselves in their strongestand most formidable array. Uganda is a native State. It must not becompared with any of those colonies where there is a white populationalready established, nor again with those inhabited by tribes ofnomadic barbarians. It finds its counterparts among the great nativeStates of India, where Imperial authority is exercised in the name andoften through the agency of a native prince and his own officers.This combination of the external brain and the native hand results ina form of government often highly acceptable to the general body ofthe inhabitants, who are confronted with no sudden or arbitrarychanges in the long-accustomed appearances of things. But it involvesall the administration of affairs in a degree of complexity anddelicacy which is absent from simpler and cruder systems. In suchcircumstances there cannot be much opening for the push and drive ofordinary commercial enterprise. The hustling business man--admirablysuited to the rough and tumble of competitive production in Europe orAmerica--becomes an incongruous and even a dangerous figure whenintroduced into the smooth and leisurely development of a nativeState. The Baganda will not be benefited either morally or materiallyby contact with modern money-making or modern money-makers. When a manis working only for the profits of his company and is judged by thefinancial results alone, he does not often under the sun of CentralAfrica acquire the best method of dealing with natives; and all sortsof difficulties and troubles will follow any sudden incursion ofbusiness enterprise into the forests and gardens of Uganda. And evenif the country is more rapidly developed by these agencies, theprofits will not go to the Government and people of Uganda, to be usedin fostering new industries, but to divers persons across the sea, whohave no concern, other than purely commercial, in its fortunes. Thisis not to advocate the arbitrary exclusion of private capital andenterprise from Uganda. Carefully directed and narrowly controlledopportunities for their activities will no doubt occur. But thenatural resources of the country should, as far as possible, bedeveloped by the Government itself, even though that may involve theassumption of many new functions.Indeed, it would be hard to find a country where the conditions weremore favourable than in Uganda to a practical experiment in StateSocialism. The land is rich; the people pacific and industrious. Thereare no great differences between class and class. One staple articleof food meets the needs of the whole population, and produces itselfalmost without the aid of man. There are no European vested intereststo block the way. Nowhere are the powers of the Government toregulate and direct the activities of the people more overwhelming ormore comprehensive. The superiority of knowledge in the rulers iscommanding. Their control upon the natives is exerted through almostevery channel; and besides the secular authorities--native andImperial--there is the spiritual and educative influence of themissionaries to infuse human sympathy and moral earnestness into theregular machinery of State.The first, and perhaps the greatest, difficulty which confronts theEuropean Socialist is the choosing of Governors to whom the positivelyawful powers indispensable to a communistic society are to beentrusted. If a race of beings could be obtained when and as requiredfrom a neighbouring planet, whose practical superiority in virtue,science, wisdom, and strength was so manifest as to be universallyacclaimed, this difficulty would disappear, and we might withcomposure await the decision of popular elections with all theirdefects and advantages. But in the absence of this dispensation theproblem of how rulers are to be selected, and how, having beenselected, they are to be controlled or changed, remains the firstquestion of politics, even in days when the functions of governmentare, in general, restricted to the modest limits of _laissez-faire_.In Uganda, however, this difficulty does not exist. A class of rulersis provided by an outside power as remote from and, in all thatconstitutes fitness to direct, as superior to the Baganda as Mr.Wells's Martians would have been to us. The British administration isin its _personnel_ absolutely disinterested. The officials draw theirsalaries, and that is all. They have no end to serve, except theimprovement of the country and the contentment of its people. By thattest and that test alone are they judged. In no other way can they winapprobation or fame. They are furthermore controlled in the exerciseof their functions by a superior authority, specially instructed inthis class of administration, and itself answerable to a Parliamentelected on a democratic franchise. At no point in the whole chain ofcommand is there any room for corruption, usurpation, or grossinefficiency.It is clear that larger powers could be entrusted to the State inregard to the labour of its citizens than would ever be accorded toprivate employers. The subjects of every European Power have acceptedthe obligation of military service to defend their respectivecountries from external attack. The Baganda, relieved from this harshobsession, have no higher duty than to cultivate and develop thebeautiful land they live in. And if it were desired to organizescientifically, upon a humane and honourable basis, the industry of anentire population, and to apply the whole fruits of their labour totheir own enrichment and elevation, no better conditions are likely tobe discovered than those which now exist in Uganda.It might at any rate be worth while to make such an experiment, ifonly as a prelude to those more general applications of the principlesof Socialism which are held in some quarters to be so necessary.
ESTP	 VII'ON SAFARI'Now the reader must really look at the map. To this point we haveproceeded by train and steamer with all the power and swiftness ofmodern communication. If we have traversed wild and lonely lands, ithas been in a railway carriage. We have disturbed the lion with thelocomotive, and all our excursions have but led back to the iron road.But at Ripon Falls we are to let go our hold upon machinery. Steam andall it means is to be shut off. We are 'to cut the painter,' and,losing the impulsion of the great ship, are for a while to paddleabout upon a vast expanse in a little cock-boat of our own. Backtowards Mombasa, three days' journey will cover nine hundred miles.Forward, you will be lucky to make forty in the same time. Return atthis moment is swift and easy. In a week it will be perhapsimpossible. Going on means going through.Everywhere great pathways are being cut into Africa. We have followedfor nearly a thousand miles one leading from the East towards thecentre. Far away from the North another line has been thrust forwardby British efforts in peace and war. From Alexandria to Cairo, fromCairo to Wady Halfa, from Halfa to Berber, from Berber to Khartoum,from Khartoum to Fashoda, from Fashoda to Gondokoro, over a distanceof nearly three thousand miles, stretches an uninterrupted service oftrains and steamers. But between the landing-stage at Jinja and thelanding-stage at Gondokoro there opens a wide gulf of yet unbridged,unconquered wilderness and jungle, across which and through which thetraveller must crawl painfully and at a foot's pace, always amiddifficulty and never wholly without danger. It is this gulf which weare now to traverse.  [Illustration: BETWEEN NIMULE AND GONDOKORO.    Capt. Read. Mr. Marsh. Dr. Goldie. Mr. Ormsby.    Col. Wilson. Mr. Churchill. Capt. Dickinson. Lieut.    Fishbourne, R.E.]The distance from the Victoria to the Albert Nyanza is about twohundred miles in the direct line, and it is all downhill. The GreatLake is hoisted high above the highest hill-tops of England. From thisvast elevated inland sea the descending Nile water flows through achannel of three thousand five hundred miles into the Mediterranean.The first and steepest stage of its journey is to the Albert Lake.This second body of water, which, except in comparison with theVictoria Nyanza, would be impressive--it is more than a hundred mileslong--lies at an altitude of two thousand three hundred feet above thesea. So that in its first two hundred miles the Nile exhausts in theexuberant improvidence of youth about a third of the impulse which isto carry it through its venerable career. Yet this considerabledescent of twelve hundred feet is itself accomplished in two shortsteps. There is one series of rapids, thirty miles long, below theRipon Falls, and another of equal extent above the Murchison Falls.Between these two declivities long reaches of open river and the wide,level expanse of Lake Chioga afford a fine waterway.Our journey from one great lake to the other divided itself thereforeinto three stages. Three marches through the forest to Kakindu, thefirst point where the Victoria Nile is navigable after the rapids;three days in canoes along the Nile and across Lake Chioga; and,lastly, five marches from the western end of Lake Chioga to the AlbertNyanza. Beyond this, again, four days in canoes and steelsailing-boats, towed by a launch, would carry us to Nimule, where therapids on the White Nile begin, and in seven or eight marches fromthere we should reach the Soudan steamers at Gondokoro. About fivehundred miles would thus be covered in twenty days. It would takeabout the same time, if trains and steamers fitted exactly, to returnby Mombasa and Suez to London.Early in the morning of November 23rd our party set off upon thisjourney. Travelling by marches from camp to camp plays a regular partin the life of the average Central African officer. He goes 'onSafari' as the Boer 'on trek.' It is a recognized state of being,which often lasts for weeks, and sometimes for months. He learns tothink of ten days' 'Safari' as we at home think of going to Scotland,and twenty days' 'Safari' as if it were less than the journey toParis. 'Safari' is itself a Swahili word of Arabic origin, meaning anexpedition and all that pertains to it. It comprises yourself andeverybody and everything you take with you--food, tents, rifles,clothing, cooks, servants, escort, porters--but especially porters.Out of the range of steam the porter is the primary factor. Thisragged figure, tottering along under his load, is the unit oflocomotion and the limit of possibility. Without porters you cannotmove. With them you move ten or twelve miles a day, if all is well.How much can he carry? How far can he carry it? These are thequestions which govern alike your calculations and your fate.Every morning the porters are divided into batches of about twenty,each under its headman. The loads, which are supposed to average aboutsixty-five pounds, are also roughly parcelled out. As each batchstarts off, the next rushes up to the succeeding heap of loads, andthere is a quarter of an hour of screaming and pushing--the strongestmen making a bee-line for the lightest-looking loads, and being beatenoff by the grim but voluble headman, the weakest weeping feebly besidea mountainous pile, till a distribution has been achieved with roughjustice, and the troop in its turn marches off with indescribableululations testifying and ministering to the spirit in which they meanto accomplish the day's journey.While these problems were being imperfectly solved, I walked downwith the Governor and one of the Engineer officers to the Ripon Falls,which are but half a mile from the Commissioner's house, and the soundof whose waters filled the air. Although the cataract is on a moderatescale, both in height and volume, its aspect--and still more itssituation--is impressive. The exit or overflow of the Great Lake isclosed by a natural rampart or ridge of black rock, broken or wornaway in two main gaps to release the waters. Through these the Nileleaps at once into majestic being, and enters upon its course as aperfect river three hundred yards wide. Standing upon the reverse sideof the wall of rock, one's eye may be almost on a plane with theshining levels of the Lake. At your very feet, literally a yard away,a vast green slope of water races downward. Below are foaming rapids,fringed by splendid trees, and pools from which great fish leapcontinually in the sunlight. We must have spent three hours watchingthe waters and revolving plans to harness and bridle them. So muchpower running to waste, such a coign of vantage unoccupied, such alever to control the natural forces of Africa ungripped, cannot butvex and stimulate imagination. And what fun to make the immemorialNile begin its journey by diving through a turbine! But to our tale.  [Illustration: FOREST SCENE NEAR RIPON FALLS.]The porters had by now got far on their road, and we must pad afterthem through the full blaze of noon. The Governor of Uganda and hisofficers have to return to Entebbe by the steamer, so it is here I bidthem good-bye and good luck, and with a final look at Ripon Falls,gleaming and resounding below, I climb the slopes of the river bankand walk off into the forest. The native path struck north-east fromthe Nile, and led into a hilly and densely wooded region. Theelephant-grass on each side of the track rose fifteen feet high. Inthe valleys great trees grew and arched above our heads, laced andtwined together with curtains of flowering creepers. Here and there aglade opened to the right or left, and patches of vivid sunlightsplashed into the gloom. Around the crossings of little streamsbutterflies danced in brilliant ballets. Many kinds of birds flewabout the trees. The jungle was haunted by game--utterly lost in itsdense entanglements. And I think it a sensation all by itself to walkon your own feet, and staff in hand, along these mysterious paths,amid such beautiful, yet sinister, surroundings, and realize that oneis really in the centre of Africa, and a long way from Piccadilly orPall Mall.Our first march was about fourteen miles, and as we had not startedtill the hot hours of the day were upon us, it was enough and to spareso far as I was concerned. Up-hill and down-hill wandered our path,now plunged in the twilight of a forest valley, now winding up theside of a scorched hill, and I had for some time been hoping to seethe camp round every corner, when at last we reached it. It consistedof two rows of green tents and a large 'banda,' or rest-house, as bigas a large barn in England, standing in a nice, trim clearing. These'bandas' are a great feature of African travel; and the dutiful chiefthrough whose territory we are passing had taken pains to make them onthe most elaborate scale. He was not long in making his appearancewith presents of various kinds. A lanky, black-faced sheep, with a fattail as big as a pumpkin, was dragged forward, bleating, by tworetainers. Others brought live hens and earthenware jars of milk andbaskets of little round eggs. The chief was a tall, intelligent-lookingman, with the winning smile and attractive manners characteristicof the country, and made his salutations with a fine air of dignityand friendship.  [Illustration: PALM TREE NEAR THE ASUA.]  [Illustration: BANDA WITH ESCORT OF KING'S AFRICAN RIFLES.]The house he had prepared for us was built of bamboo framework,supported upon a central row of Y-shaped tree-stems, with ahigh-pitched roof heavily thatched with elephant-grass, and walls ofwattled reeds. The floors of African 'bandas' when newly made arebeautifully smooth and clean, and strewn with fresh green rushes; theinterior is often cunningly divided into various apartments, and themain building is connected with kitchens and offices of the sameunsubstantial texture by veranda-shaded passages. In fact, they provea high degree of social knowledge and taste in the natives, who makethem with almost incredible rapidity from the vegetation of thesurrounding jungle; and the sensation of entering one of these lofty,dim, cool, and spacious interiors, and sinking into the soft rush-bedof the floor, with something to drink which is, at any rate, nottepid, well repays the glaring severities of a march under anEquatorial sun. The 'banda,' however, is a luxury of which thetraveller should beware, for if it has stood for more than a week itbecomes the home of innumerable insects, many of approved malevolenceand venom, and spirillum fever is almost invariably caught fromsleeping in old shelters or on disused camping-grounds.Life 'on Safari' is rewarded by a sense of completeness andself-satisfied detachment. You have got to 'do' so many miles a day,and when you have 'done' them your day's work is over. 'Tis a simpleprogramme, which leaves nothing more to be demanded or desired. Veryearly in the morning, often an hour before daybreak, the bugles of theKing's African Rifles sounded réveille. Every one dresses hurriedly bycandle-light, eats a dim breakfast while dawn approaches; tentscollapse, and porters struggle off with their burdens. Then the marchbegins. The obvious thing is to walk. There is no surer way of keepingwell in Uganda than to walk twelve or fourteen miles a day. But if thetraveller will not make the effort, there are alternatives. There isthe rickshaw, which was described in the last chapter--restful, buttedious; and the litter, carried on the heads of six porters ofdifferent sizes, and shifted every now and then, with a dishearteningjerk, to their shoulders and back again--this is quite asuncomfortable as it sounds. Ponies cannot, or at least do not, live inUganda, though an experiment was just about to be made with them bythe Chief of the Police, who is convinced that with really carefulstable management, undertaken in detail by the owner himself, theycould be made to flourish. Mules have a better chance, though stillnot a good one. We took one with us on the last spell of 'Safari' toGondokoro, and were told it was sure to die; but we left it inapparently excellent condition and spirits.  [Illustration: AN ENCAMPMENT.]But the best of all methods of progression in Central Africa--howeverastonishing it may seem--is the bicycle. In the dry season the pathsthrough the bush, smoothed by the feet of natives, afford an excellentsurface. Even when the track is only two feet wide, and when thedensest jungle rises on either side and almost meets above the head,the bicycle skims along, swishing through the grass and brushing theencroaching bushes, at a fine pace; and although at every few hundredyards sharp rocks, loose stones, a water-course, or a steep hillcompel dismounting, a good seven miles an hour can usually bemaintained. And think what this means. From my own experience I shouldsuppose that with a bicycle twenty-five to thirty miles a day couldregularly be covered in Uganda, and, if only the porters could keepup, all journeys could be nearly trebled, and every white officer'sradius of action proportionately increased.Nearly all the British officers I met already possessed and usedbicycles, and even the native chiefs are beginning to acquire them.But what is needed to make the plan effective is a good system ofstone, fumigated, insect-proof rest-houses at stages of thirty mileson all the main lines of communication. Such a development would meanan enormous saving in the health of white officials and a valuableaccession to their power. Had I known myself before coming to Ugandathe advantages which this method presents, I should have been able totravel far more widely through the country by the simple expedient oftrebling the stages of my journeys, and sending porters on a week inadvance to pitch camps and deposit food at wide intervals. And then,instead of merely journeying from one Great Lake to the other, Icould, _within the same limits of time_, have explored the fertileand populous plateau of Toro, descended the beautiful valley of theSemliki, and traversed the Albert Lake from end to end, and skirtedthe slopes of Ruenzori. 'If youth but knew...!'But the march, however performed, has its termination; and if, as isrecommended, you stop to breakfast and rest upon the way, the new campwill be almost ready upon arrival. During the heat of the day everyone retires to his tent or to the more effective shelter of the'banda,' to read and sleep till the evening. Then as the sun gets lowwe emerge to smoke and talk, and there is, perhaps, just time for theenergetic to pursue an antelope, or shoot a few guinea-fowl orpigeons.With the approach of twilight comes the mosquito, strident-voiced andfever-bearing; and the most thorough precautions have to be takenagainst him and other insect dangers. We dine in a largemosquito-house made entirely of fine gauze, and about twelve feetcubically. The bedding, which should if possible be packed in tinboxes, is unrolled during the day, and carefully protected bymosquito-nets well tucked in, against all forms of vermin. Every oneputs on mosquito-boots--long, soft, leather leggings, reaching to thehips. You are recommended not to sit on cane-bottomed chairs withoutputting a newspaper or a cushion on them, to wear a cap, a scarf, andpossibly gloves, and to carry a swishing mosquito-trap. Thus onemoves, comparatively secure, amid a chorus of ferocious buzzings.To these precautions are added others. You must never walk barefoot onthe floor, no matter how clean it is, or an odious worm, called a'jigger,' will enter your foot to raise a numerous family and apainful swelling. On the other hand, be sure when you put on boots orshoes that, however hurried, you turn them upside down and lookinside, lest a scorpion, a small snake, or a perfectly frightful kindof centipede may be lying in ambush. Never throw your clothescarelessly upon the ground, but put them away at once in a tin box,and shut it tight, or a perfect colony of fierce-biting creatures willbeset them. And, above all, quinine! To the permanent resident inthese strange countries no drug can be of much avail; for either itsprotection is diminished with habit, or the doses have to beincreased to impossible limits. But the traveller, who is passingthrough on a journey of only a few months, may recur with safety andwith high advantage to that admirable prophylactic. Opinions differ asto how it should be taken. The Germans, with their love of exactnesseven in regard to the most uncertain things, prescribe thirty grainson each seventh day and eighth day alternately. We followed a simplerplan of taking a regular ten grains every day, from the moment we leftPort Said till we arrived at Khartoum. No one in my party sufferedfrom fever even for a day during the whole journey.Our second day's march was about the same in length and character,except that we were nearer the river, and as the path led through thetwilight of the forest we saw every now and then a gleam of broadwaters on our left. At frequent intervals--five or six times duringthe day--long caravans of native porters were met carrying the produceof the fertile districts between Lake Chioga and Mount Elgon intoJinja. Nothing could better show the need of improved communicationsthan this incipient and potential trade--ready to begin and thrustingforward along bush-paths on the heads of tottering men. For the rest,the country near the river seemed the densest and most impenetrablejungle, hiding in its recesses alike its inhabitants and its game.The third morning, however, brought us among 'shambas,' as the patchesof native cultivation are called; and the road was among plantationsof bananas, millet, cotton, castor-oil, and chilies. Here in Usoga, asthroughout Uganda, the one staple crop is the banana; and as thisfruit, when once planted, grows and propagates of its own accord,requiring no thought or exertion, it finds special favour with theimprovident natives, and sustains them year after year in leisuredabundance, till a sudden failure and a fearful famine restore theharsh balances of the world.After a tramp of twelve miles, and while it was still comparativelyearly--for we had started before dawn--we reached Kakindu. The trackled out of the forest of banana-groves downwards into more open spacesand blazing sunlight, and there before us was the Nile. Already--fortymiles from its source, near four thousand from its mouth--it was anoble river: nearly a third of a mile in breadth of clear, deep waterrolling forward majestically between banks of foliage and verdure. The'Chioga flotilla,' consisting of the small steam launch, _Victoria_, asteel boat, and two or three dug-out canoes, scooped out oftree-trunks, awaited us; and after the long, hot business of embarkingthe baggage and crowding the native servants in among it, wascompleted, we parted from our first relay of escorts and porters, anddrifted out on the flood.The next three days of our life were spent on the water--firstcruising down the Victoria Nile till it flows into Chioga, and thentraversing the smooth, limpid expanses of that lake. Every evening welanded at camps prepared by the Busoga chiefs, pitched our tents,lighted our fires, and erected our mosquito-houses, while dusk drewon, and thunderstorms--frequent at this season of the year--wheeled invivid splendour about the dark horizon. All through the hot hours ofthe day one lay at the bottom of massive canoes, sheltered from thesun by an improvised roof of rushes and wet grass. From time to time astrange bird, or, better still, the rumour of a hippo--nose justpeeping above the water--enlivened the slow and sultry passage of thehours; and one great rock, crowded with enormous crocodiles, all ofwhom--a score at least--leaped together into the water at the firstshot, afforded at least one really striking spectacle.As the Victoria Nile approaches Lake Chioga, it broadens out into widelagoons, and the sloping banks of forest and jungle give place tounbroken walls of papyrus-reeds, behind which the flat, surroundingcountry is invisible, and above which only an isolated triangular hillmay here and there be descried, purple in the distance. The lakeitself is about fifty miles long from east to west, and eleven broad,but its area and perimeter are greatly extended by a series of longarms, or rather fingers, stretching out in every direction, butespecially to the north, and affording access by water to very wideand various districts. All these arms, and even a great part of thecentre of the lake, are filled with reeds, grass, and water-lilies,for Chioga is the first of the great sponges upon which the Nilelavishes its waters. Although a depth of about twelve feet can usuallybe counted on, navigation is impeded by floating weeds andwater-plants; and when the storms have swept the northern shore,numerous papyrus-tangled islands, complete with their populations ofbirds and animals, are detached, and swim erratically about the laketo block accustomed channels and puzzle the pilot.For one long day our little palpitating launch, towing its flotilla ofcanoes, plashed through this curious region, at times winding througha glade in the papyrus forest scarcely a dozen yards across, thenpresently emerging into wide flood, stopping often to clear ourpropeller from tangles of accumulating greenery. The middle of thelake unrolls large expanses of placid water. The banks and reedsrecede into the distance, and the whole universe becomes a vastencircling blue globe of sky and water, rimmed round its middle by athin band of vivid green. Time vanishes, and nothing is left but spaceand sunlight.All this while we must carefully avoid the northern, and particularlythe north-western shore, for the natives are altogetherunadministered, and nearly all the tribes are hostile. To pursue theelephants which, of course (so they say), abound in these forbiddenprecincts is impossible; to land for food or fuel would be dangerous,and even to approach might draw a splutter of musketry or a shower ofspears from His Majesty's yet unpersuaded subjects.The Nile leaves the north-west corner of the lake at Namasali andflows along a broad channel above a mile in width, still enclosed bysolid papyrus walls and dotted with floating islands. Another fortymiles of steaming and we reach Mruli. Mruli is a representativeAfrican village. Its importance is more marked upon the maps than onthe ground. An imposing name in large black letters calls up the ideaof a populous and considerable township. All that meets the eye,however, are a score of funnel-shaped grass huts, surrounded by dismalswamps and labyrinths of reeds, over which clouds of mosquitoes dancedfeverishly. A long wattled pier had been built from terra firma tonavigable water, but the channel by which it could be approached hadbeen wholly blocked by a floating island, and this had to be towedpainfully out of the way before we could land. Here we were met by afresh escort of King's African Rifles, as spick and span in uniform,as precise in their military bearing, as if they were at Aldershot; bya mob of fresh porters, and, lastly, by the only friendly tribefrom the northern bank of the river: and while tents were pitched,baggage landed, and cooking-fires began to glow, these four hundredwild spearmen, casting aside their leopard skins, danced naked in thedusk.  [Illustration: LANDING AT MRULI.]
ESTP	 VIIIMURCHISON FALLSWe had intended, on leaving the Nile where it turns northward atMruli, to march directly across to Hoima, on the Albert Lake; and thisjourney, by way of Masindi, would have required four marches. Buttales of the beauty and wonder of the Murchison Falls had captivatedmy mind, and before embarking at Kakindu a new plan had been resolved.Runners were sent back to the telegraph wire at Jinja, and thence amessage was flashed by Kampala to Hoima, directing the flotilla whichawaited us there, to steam to the north end of the Albert and meet usby the foot of the Murchison Falls at Fajao. Thither we were now toproceed by five marches--two to Masindi and three more turningnorthward to the Nile.The road from Mruli consists of a sort of embanked track throughlow-lying and desolate scrub and jungle. The heavy black cotton soil,cracked and granulated by the heat, offered at this time a hardened ifuneven surface to the bicycle; but in the rains such paths must becomeutterly impassable. As one advances westward the country improvesrapidly in aspect. The dismal flats of the South Chioga shore are leftbehind, and the traveller discovers more characteristic Uganda sceneryin a region of small hills and great trees. Before Masindi is reachedwe are again in a rich and beautiful land. Pools of shining water, setin verdant green, flash back the sunbeams. Bold bluffs and ridges riseon all sides from amid the unceasing undulations of the ground.Streams plash merrily downwards through rocky channels. The yellowgrass roofs of frequent villages peep from underneath their groves ofbananas among broad streaks of cultivated ground, and chiefs andheadmen salute the stranger with grave yet curious politeness as thelong 'safari' winds beneath the trees.The heat grows as the altitude dwindles, and even in the early morningthe sun sits hard and heavy on the shoulders. At ten o'clock its poweris tremendous. So long as the roadway consisted of nobbly lumps ofblack cotton soil bicycling, though possible in places, was scarcelypleasant. But the change in the landscape arises from the change inthe soil. The fields are now of bright red earth, the paths of redsandstone washed in places almost as smooth and as firm as asphalt bythe rains and sparkling with crystalline dust; and when the ridgeswhich form the watershed between Lake Chioga and Lake Albert had beentopped, my bicycle glided almost without impulsion down four miles ofgradual descent into Masindi. This station--which is the residence ofa collector--lies embosomed in a wide bay of gently-sloping hillsclothed with noble trees. It is indeed a pleasant spot. There are realhouses, standing on high stone platforms, with deep verandas and wiregauze windows. The roads are laid out in bold geometry of broad redlines. There are avenues of planted trees, delicious banks of flowers,a prepared breakfast, _cold_, not cool, drinks, a telegraph office,and a file of the _Times_. What more could an explorer desire or theFates accord?We were now to strike northwards to the Nile at Fajao in three longmarches (for the porters) of about sixteen miles each. Upon the Hoimaroad some preparations had been made to make the journey easier byclearing the encroaching jungle from the track and constructingrest-houses. But my change of plan had disconcerted thesearrangements, and on the new route we had to clear our own paths fromthe overgrowth by which even in a season, if unused, they are choked,and to trust to tents and improvised shelters. Progress was thereforeslow and camps unpretentious. But all was redeemed by the wonders ofthe scene.For a whole day we crept through the skirts of the Hoima forest, amidan exuberance of vegetation which is scarcely describable. I hadtravelled through tropical forests in Cuba and India, and had oftenbefore admired their enchanting, yet sinister, luxuriance. But theforests of Uganda, for magnificence, for variety of form and colour,for profusion of brilliant life--plant, bird, insect, reptile,beast--for the vast scale and awful fecundity of the natural processesthat are beheld at work, eclipsed, and indeed effaced, all previousimpressions. One becomes, not without a secret sense of aversion, thespectator of an intense convulsion of life and death. Reproduction anddecay are locked struggling in infinite embraces. In this glitteringEquatorial slum huge trees jostle one another for room to live;slender growths stretch upwards--as it seems in agony--towardssunlight and life. The soil bursts with irrepressible vegetations.Every victor, trampling on the rotting mould of exterminatedantagonists, soars aloft only to encounter another host of aerialrivals, to be burdened with masses of parasitic foliage, smothered inthe glorious blossoms of creepers, laced and bound and interwoven withinterminable tangles of vines and trailers. Birds are as bright asbutterflies; butterflies are as big as birds. The air hums with flyingcreatures; the earth crawls beneath your foot. The telegraph-wire runsnorthward to Gondokoro through this vegetable labyrinth. Even itspoles had broken into bud!As we advanced, continually rising or falling with the waves of theland, and moving in rapid alternations from a blazing patch ofsunshine into a cloistered dimness, every now and then the path becamesmooth, broad, and of firm sandstone. And here one could watch thecolumns of marching soldier-ants. Perhaps in a hundred yards the roadwould be crossed four times by these fierce armies. They move inregular array, and upon purposes at once inscrutable and unswerving. Abrown band, perhaps two inches broad and an inch and a half _deep_, isdrawn across your track. Its ends are lost in the recesses of thejungle. It moves unceasingly and with a multiplied rapidity; for eachant runs swiftly forward, whether upon the ground or upon the backs ofhis already moving comrades. About a yard away, on each side of themain column, are the screening lines of the flank-guards, and for fiveyards beyond this every inch is searched, every object is examined bytireless and fearless reconnoitring patrols. Woe to the enemy who isovertaken by these hordes. No matter what his size or nature, he isattacked at once by an ever-increasing number of assailants, each oneof whom, upon remorseless instinct, plunges his strong mandibles inthe flesh, and will have his head pulled off his shoulders rather thanlet go.These ant armies fascinated me. I could not resist interfering withthem. With my walking-stick I gently broke the column and pushed theswarming rope off its line of march. Their surprise, their confusion,their indignation were extreme. But not for an instant did they pause.In a second the scouts were running all over my boots eagerly seekingan entry, and when I looked back from this to the walking-stick I heldit was already alive. With a gesture so nimble that it might have beenmisunderstood, I cast it from me and jumped back out of the dangercircle until I found refuge on a large rock at a respectful distance.The Soudanese sergeant-major of the escort, a splendid negro, drilledas smart as a Grenadier Guardsman and with a good long row of medalribbons on his khaki tunic, so far forgot himself as to grin from earto ear. But his gravity was fully restored when I invited him torescue my walking-stick, which lay abandoned on the field in themandibles of the victorious enemy. The devoted man was, however, equalto the crisis.I have a sad tale also to tell of the perversity of butterflies. Neverwere seen such flying fairies. They flaunted their splendid liveriesin inconceivable varieties of colour and pattern in our faces at everystep. Swallow-tails, fritillaries, admirals, tortoise-shells,peacocks, orange-tips--all executed in at least a dozen novel andcontrasted styles, with many even more beautiful, but bearing noresemblance to our British species--flitted in sunshine from flower toflower, glinted in the shadow of great trees, or clustered on the pathto suck the moisture from any swampy patch. The butterfly is a dirtyfeeder, and if ever some piece of putrescent filth lay odorous on theground, be sure it would be covered with a cloud of these greedyinsects, come in such gay attire to eat such sorry meat. I found themsometimes so intoxicated with feasting that I could pick them up quitegently in my fingers without the need of any net at all.To any one who has ever tried to collect the modest and now all toorare and scattered butterflies of Britain, these sights could not butbe a hard temptation. For a week I had resisted it, not because it wasnot easy enough to make a net, but because of the difficulty ofsetting and preserving the prizes; and it was not until the end of ourfirst day's march out from Masindi that I was told that much the bestway of sending butterflies home from Africa was to enclose them inneatly-folded triangles of paper and leave them to be set in London.Forthwith, out of telegraph-wire and mosquito-curtain, a net was made,and before another dawn I was fully equipped. It is almost incredibleto state that from that very moment, except near the Murchison Falls,I scarcely ever saw a really fine butterfly again all the way toGondokoro. Whether this was due to the intelligent perversity of theseinsects, or to the fact that we had left the deeper recesses of theforest region, I do not inquire; but the fact remains, and I carryaway from the butterflies of Uganda only the haunting memories ofunrealized opportunity.This first day's march from Masindi was a long one, and our porterspanted and toiled under their loads through the heat of the day. Itwas not till the afternoon that the main body came into camp, andstragglers trickled through into the dusk. Meanwhile the local nativesbuilt under our eyes, with extraordinary speed and cleverness, aspacious dining-hall and two or three quite excellent bedrooms fromthe surrounding elephant-grass and bamboo groves; and we fared ascomfortably in these two humble dwellings as if we dwelt in kings'palaces. The forest was a little thinner on the second day, althoughthe jungle was of the same dense and tangled fertility. We started anhour before sunrise, and by eight o'clock had climbed to the saddle ofthe high rocky wall which contains the valley of the Victoria Nile.From this elevation of, perhaps, six hundred feet above the generallevel of the plain a comprehensive view of the landscape was for thefirst time possible. In every direction spread a wide sea of foliage,thinning here into bush, darkening there into forest, rising andfalling with the waves of the land, and broken only by occasionalpeaks of rock. Far away to the north-west a long silver gleam, justdiscernible through the haze of the horizon, revealed to our eyes thedistant prospect of the Albert Nyanza. The camera cannot do justice tosuch a panorama. In photographs these vast expanses look like merescrubby commons, inhospitable and monotonous to the eye, melancholy tothe soul. One has to remember that here are Kew Gardens and the Zoocombined on an unlimited scale; that Nature's central productivelaboratory is here working night and day at full blast; and that thescrubby common of the picture is really a fairyland of glades andvistas, through which an army of a hundred thousand men might marchwithout the glint of a bayonet, or even the dust of an artillerycolumn, betraying their presence to the watcher on the crag.Our camp this night lay in a tiny patch cleared in the heart of thiswild world. The cluster of tents under a canopy of palms, illumined bythe watch-fires, bright with lanterns, and busy with the movingfigures of men and the hum of human activity, seemed at a hundredyards' distance an island of society amid an ocean of Nature. To whatstrange perils--apart altogether from the certainty of losing yourway--would a walk of a quarter of a mile in any direction expose thewanderer? To withdraw from the firelight was to be engulfed in thesavage conditions of prehistoric time. Advance, and the telegraph-wirewould tell you the latest quotations of the London markets, thefigures of the newest by-election. An odd sensation!  [Illustration: MURCHISON FALLS.]We had scarce proceeded for an hour on our third march, when just asit grew daylight a low vibrant murmur began to be perceptible in theair. Now it was lost as we descended into some moist valley, now itbroke even more strongly on the ear as we reached the summit of someascent--the sound of the Nile plunging down the Murchison Falls. Andby nine o'clock, when we were still about ten miles off, a loud,insistent, and unceasing hum had developed. These Falls are certainlythe most remarkable in the whole course of the Nile. At Foweira thenavigable reaches stretching from Lake Chioga are interrupted bycataracts, and the river hurries along in foam and rapid down agradual but continuous stairway, enclosed by rocky walls, but still abroad flood. Two miles above Fajao these walls contract suddenly tillthey are _not six yards apart_, and through this strangling portal, asfrom the nozzle of a hose, the whole tremendous river is shot in onesingle jet down an abyss of a hundred and sixty feet.The escarpment over which the Nile falls curves away in a vast bay ofprecipitous, or almost precipitous, cliffs, broken here and there bymore gradual rifts, and forms the eastern wall of the Albert Lake,from whose waters it rises abruptly in many places to a height of sixor seven hundred feet. Arrived at the verge of this descent, the lowerreaches of the Victoria Nile could be discerned, stretching away mileafter mile in a broad, gleaming ribbon almost to its mouth on thelake. The Falls themselves were, indeed, invisible, concealed behind aforested bluff, but their roaring left no doubt of their presence.Below me a zigzag path led down by long descents to the water's edge,and on an open meadow a row of tents and grass houses had already beenset up.Fajao as a native town was no more. At hardly any point in Uganda hasthe sleeping sickness made such frightful ravages. At least sixthousand persons had perished in the last two years. Almost the wholepopulation had been swept away. Scarcely enough remained to form thedeputation, who, in their white robes, could be distinguished at theentrance to the cleared area of the camping-ground. And this clearedarea was itself of the utmost importance; for all around it the powersof evil were strong. The groves which fringed and overhung the riverswarmed with tsetse flies of newly-replenished venom and approvedmalignity, and no man could enter them except at a risk. After pausingfor a few minutes to watch a troop of baboons who were leapingabout from tree to tree on the opposite hill, and who seemed as big asmen, I climbed down the zigzag, photographed the deputation, and shookhands with the chief. He was a very civilized chief--by name JamesKago--who wore riding-breeches and leather gaiters, and who spoke afew unexpected sentences of excellent English. He seemed in the bestof spirits, and so did the remnant of the population who gatheredbehind him, though whether this was due to stoical philosophy or goodmanners, I could not tell. All was smiles and bows and gurglings ofguttural gratification. The district officer who had travelled with meexplained that the chief had had the path up to the top of the Fallsimproved, and that he proposed, after we had lunched and rested, toguide us along it to the very edge of the abyss, but that the forestalong the river-bank was so dangerous because of the tsetses that weshould in prudence wear veils and gloves before entering it. With allof this I made no quarrel.  [Illustration: FAJAO, WITH NATIVES ASSEMBLED TO WELCOME US.]In a little rocky inlet forming a small natural harbour we found theAlbert flotilla already arrived. It consisted of the _Kenia_, asteam-launch about forty feet long, decked, and with a cabin, anddrawing four feet of water, and three steel sailing-boats of differentsizes--to wit, the _James Martin_, the _Good Intent_, and the_Kisingiri_. These small vessels were to carry us down the VictoriaNile into the Albert Nyanza, across the top end of this lake, and thendown the hundred and seventy miles' reach of the White Nile tillnavigation is barred at Nimule by more cataracts. They were manned bya crew of jolly Swahili tars smartly dressed in white breeches andblue jerseys, on whose breasts the words 'Uganda Marine' were workedin yellow worsted. The engineer of the steam-launch commanded thewhole with plenary powers of discipline and diplomacy; and it was bymeans of this little group of cock-boats that trade and communicationswith the Nile province and around the whole of Lake Albert were alonemaintained. The flotilla, nestling together in its harbour andsheltered by a rocky breakwater from the swift current, made a prettypicture; and behind it the Nile, streaked and often covered with thecreamy foam of the Falls, swept along in majestic flood six hundredyards from brim to brim.  [Illustration: FLOTILLA AT FAJAO.]We began our climb to the summit of the Falls in the blazing heatof the day, and for the first time I was forced to confess the CentralAfrican sun as formidable as that which beats on the plains of India.Yet even at the worst moments it is more endurable, for the breezedoes not stifle you with the breath of a furnace. First the path ledthrough the deadly groves; and here, of course, the most beautifulbutterflies--some five inches across the wings--floated tantalizingly.Sometimes we descended to where the river lapped along the rocks andcurled in eddies under floating islands of froth. Precautions wererequired against diverse dangers. The Nile below the Murchison Fallsswarms with crocodiles, some of an enormous size, and herds ofhippopotamus are found every half mile or so; so that, what with therifles which it was necessary to take for great beasts, and the glovesand veils which were our protection against even more villainous smallones, we were painfully encumbered. Indeed, the veils were such anuisance and the heat was so great that I resolved to hazard thetsetse and took mine off. But after half an hour of menacing buzzings,and after a fly--presumably of the worst character--had actuallysettled on my shoulder, brushed off by the promptness of mycompanion, I changed my mind again.As we were thus scrambling along the brink of the river a crocodilewas discovered basking in the sunshine on a large rock in mid-stream,about a hundred and fifty yards from the shore. I avow, with whatregrets may be necessary, an active hatred of these brutes and adesire to kill them. It was a tempting shot, for the ruffian laysleeping in the sun-blaze, his mouth wide open and his fat and scalyflanks exposed. Two or three attendant white birds hopped about him,looking for offal, which I have been assured (and does not Herodotusvouch for it?) they sometimes pick from his very teeth. I fired. Whatthe result of the shot may have been I do not know, for the crocodilegave one leap of mortal agony or surprise and disappeared in thewaters. But then it was my turn to be astonished. The river at thisdistance from the Falls was not broader than three hundred yards, andwe could see the whole shore of the opposite bank quite plainly. Ithad hitherto appeared to be a long brown line of mud, on which the sunshone dully. At the sound of the shot the whole of this bank of theriver, over the extent of at least a quarter of a mile, sprang intohideous life, and my companions and I saw hundreds and hundreds ofcrocodiles, of all sorts and sizes, rushing madly into the Nile, whosewaters along the line of the shore were lashed into white foam,exactly as if a heavy wave had broken. It could be no exaggeration tosay that at least a thousand of these saurians had been disturbed at asingle shot. Our British friends explained that Fajao was thefavourite haunt of the crocodiles, who lay in the water below theFalls waiting for dead fish and animals carried over by the river.Very often, they told us, hippos from the upper river and from LakeChioga were caught and swept downwards, the force of the water'breaking every bone in their body.' 'Indeed,' added the officer,somewhat obscurely, 'they are _very lucky_ if they are not smashedinto pulp.'  [Illustration: THE TOP OF THE MURCHISON FALLS.]  [Illustration: UGANDA SCENERY.]At length we turned a corner and came face to face with the Falls.They are wonderful to behold, not so much because of theirheight--though that is impressive--but because of the immense volumeof water which is precipitated through such a narrow outlet. Indeed,seeing the great size of the river below the Falls, it seemedimpossible to believe that it was wholly supplied from this singlespout. In clouds of rainbow spray and amid thunderous concussions ofsound we set to work to climb the southern side of the rock wall, andafter an hour achieved the summit. It was possible to walk to withinan inch of the edge and, lying on one's face with a cautious headcraned over, to look actually down upon the foaming hell beneath. Thenarrowness of the gorge at the top had not been overstated. I doubtwhether it is fifteen feet across from sheer rock to sheer rock. Tenpounds, in fact, would throw an iron bridge across the Nile at thispoint. But it is evident that the falling waters must have arched andcaved away the rock below their surface in an extraordinary degree,for otherwise there could not possibly be room for the whole river todescend.We waited long at this strange place, watching the terrible waters,admiring their magnificent fury, trying to compute their force. Whocan doubt that the bridle is preparing which shall hold and directtheir strength, or that the day will come when forlorn Fajao--nowdepopulated and almost derelict--will throb with the machinery ofmanufacture and electric production? I cannot believe that modernscience will be content to leave these mighty forces untamed, unused,or that regions of inexhaustible and unequalled fertility, capable ofsupplying all sorts of things that civilized industry needs in greaterquantity every year, will not be brought--in spite of their insectsand their climate--into cultivated subjection. Certain it is that theeconomy of the world remains hopelessly incomplete while theseneglects prevail, and, while it would be wasteful and foolish tohustle, it would be more wasteful and more foolish to abate the steadyprogress of development.From these reflections I was roused abruptly by the Nile, a wave ofwhose turbulent waters--cast up by some unusual commotion as theyapproached the verge--boiled suddenly over a ledge of rock hithertohigh and dry, carrying an ugly and perhaps indignant swish of water tomy very feet.
ESTP	 IXHIPPO CAMPIt took no little time to stow all our baggage, food and tents uponthe launch and its steel boats, and though our camp was astir athalf-past three, the dawn was just breaking when we were able toembark. And then the _James Martin_ wedged herself upon a rock a fewyards from the shore of the sheltering inlet, and seemed to have gotherself hard and fast; for pull as we might with all the force of thelaunch at full steam, and the added weight of the current to help us,not an inch would she budge. Everything had, therefore, to be unloadedagain from the straggler, and when she had thus been lightened and herfreight transferred to the attendant canoes, James Kago ordered histribesmen to leap into the water, which was not more than five feetdeep, and push and lift the little vessel whilst the steamer tugged.But this task the natives were most reluctant to perform out offear of the crocodiles, who might at any moment make a pounce,notwithstanding all the noise and clatter. Thereupon the energeticchief seized hold of them one after another round the waist, and threwthem full-splash into the stream, till at least twenty wereaccumulated round the boat, and then, what with their impatience tofinish their uncomfortable job and our straining tow rope, the _JamesMartin_ floated free, was reloaded, and we were off.  [Illustration: THE LANDING-PLACE AT FAJAO.]As we drifted out into mid-stream the most beautiful view of the fallsbroke upon us. It was already almost daylight, but the sun had not yetactually topped the great escarpment over which the Nile descends. Thebanks on both sides of the river, clad with dense and lofty forest andrising about twice as high as Cliveden Woods from the water's edge,were dark in shadow. The river was a broad sheet of steel grey veinedwith paler streaks of foam. The rock portals of the falls were jettyblack, and between them, illumined by a single shaft of sunlight,gleamed the tremendous cataract--a thing of wonder and glory, wellworth travelling all the way to see.We were soon among the hippopotami. Every two or three hundred yards,and at every bend of the river, we came upon a herd of from five totwenty. To us in a steam launch they threatened no resistance ordanger. But their inveterate hostility to canoes leads to repeatedloss of life among the native fishermen, whose frail craft arecrumpled like eggshells in the snap of enormous jaws. Indeed, all theway from here to Nimule they are declared to be the scourge and terrorof the Nile. Fancy mistaking a hippopotamus--almost the largestsurviving mammal in the world--for a water lily. Yet nothing is moreeasy. The whole river is dotted with floating lilies detached from anyroot and drifting along contentedly with the current. It is the habitof the hippo to loll in the water showing only his eyes and the tipsof his ears, and perhaps now and again a glimpse of his nose, and thusconcealed his silhouette is, at three hundred yards, almostindistinguishable from the floating vegetation. I thought they alsolooked like giant cats peeping. So soon, however, as they saw uscoming round a corner and heard the throbbing of the propeller, theywould raise their whole heads out of the water to have a look, andthen immediately dive to the bottom in disgust. Our practice wasthen to shut off steam and drift silently down upon them. In this wayone arrives in the middle of the herd, and when curiosity or want ofair compels them to come up again there is a chance of a shot. Onegreat fellow came up to breathe within five yards of the boat, and thelook of astonishment, of alarm, of indignation, in his large,expressive eyes--as with one vast snort he plunged below--was comicalto see. These creatures are not easy to kill. They bob up in the mostunexpected quarters, and are down again in a second. One does not liketo run the risk of merely wounding them, and the target presented issmall and vanishing. I shot one who sunk with a harsh sort of screamand thud of striking bullet. We waited about a long time for him tofloat up to the surface, but in vain, for he must have been carriedinto or under a bed of reeds and could not be retrieved.  [Illustration: EARLY MORNING ON THE NILE AT FAJAO.]  [Illustration: FAJAO.]The Murchison, or Karuma, Falls, as the natives call them, are aboutthirty miles distance from the Albert Lake, and as with the current wemade six or seven miles an hour, this part of our journey was short.Here the Nile offers a splendid waterway. The main channel is at leastten feet deep, and navigation, in spite of shifting sandbanks,islands, and entanglements of reeds and other vegetation, is notdifficult. The river itself is of delicious, sweet water, and flowsalong in many places half-a-mile broad. Its banks for the first twentymiles were shaded by beautiful trees, and here and there contained bybold headlands, deeply scarped by the current. The serrated outline ofthe high mountains on the far side of the Albert Nyanza could soon beseen painted in shadow on the western sky. As the lake is approachedthe riparian scenery degenerates; the sandbanks became more intricate;the banks are low and flat, and huge marshes encroach upon the riveron either hand. Yet even here the traveller moves through an imposingworld.At length, after five or six hours' steaming, we cleared the mouth ofthe Victoria Nile and swam out on to the broad expanses of the lake.Happily on this occasion it was quite calm. How I wished then that Ihad not allowed myself to be deterred by time and croakers from alonger voyage, and that we could have turned to the south and,circumnavigating the Albert, ascended the Semliki river with all itsmysterious attractions, have visited the forests on the south-westernshores, and caught, perhaps, a gleam of the snows of Ruenzori! But wewere in the fell grip of carefully-considered arrangements, and, likechildren in a Christmas toy shop always looking back, were alwayshurried on.Yet progress offered its prizes as well as delay. Some of my party hadwon the confidence of the engineer of the launch, who had revealed tothem a valuable secret. It appeared that 'somewhere between LakeAlbert and Nimule'--not to be too precise--there was a place knownonly to the elect, and not to more than one or two of them, whereelephants abounded and rhinoceros swarmed. And these rhinoceros, be itobserved, were none of your common black variety with two stumpy hornsalmost equal in size, and a prehensile tip to their noses. Not at all;they were what are called 'white' rhino--Burchell's whiterhinoceros,[1] that is their full style--with one long, thin, enormoushorn, perhaps a yard long--on their noses, and with broad, squareupper lips. Naturally we were all very much excited, and in order togain a day on our itinerary to study these very rare and remarkableanimals more closely, we decided not to land and pitch a camp, but tosteam on all through the night. Meanwhile our friend the engineerundertook to accomplish the difficult feat of finding the channel,with all its windings, in the dark.The scene as we left the Albert Lake and entered the White Nile was ofsurpassing beauty. The sun was just setting behind the high, jaggedpeaks of the Congo Mountains to the westward. One after another, andrange behind range, these magnificent heights--rising perhaps to eightor nine thousand feet--unfolded themselves in waves of darkplum-coloured rock, crested with golden fire. The lake stretched awayapparently without limit like the sea, towards the southward in anever-broadening swell of waters--flushed outside the shadow of themountains into a delicious pink. Across its surface our tinyflotilla--four on a string--paddled its way towards the narrowingnorthern shores and the channel of the Nile.  [Illustration: APPROACH TO LAKE ALBERT, WITH THE CONGO HILLS IN THE    DISTANCE.]  [Illustration: WADELAI.]The White Nile leaves the Albert Lake in majesty. All the way toNimule it is often more like a lake than a river. For the first twentymiles of its course it seemed to me to be at least two miles across.The current is gentle, and sometimes in the broad lagoons and baysinto which the placid waters spread themselves it is scarcelyperceptible. I slept under an awning in the _Kisingiri_, the last andsmallest boat of the string, and, except for the native steersman andpiles of baggage, had it all to myself. It was, indeed, delightful tolie fanned by cool breezes and lulled by the soothing lappings of theripples, and to watch, as it were, from dreamland the dark outlines ofthe banks gliding swiftly past and the long moonlit levels of thewater.At daybreak we were at Wadelai. In twenty-four hours from leavingFajao we had made nearly a hundred miles of our voyage. Without thesigh of a single porter these small boats and launch had transportedthe whole of our 'safari' over a distance which would on land haverequired the labours and sufferings of three hundred men during atleast a week of unbroken effort. Such are the contrasts which impressupon one the importance of utilising the water-ways of CentralAfrica, of establishing a complete circulation along them, and ofusing railways in the first instance merely to link them together.Wadelai was deserted. Upon a high bank of the river stood a long rowof tall, peaked, thatched houses, the walls of a fort, and buildingsof European construction. All was newly abandoned to ruin. TheBelgians are evacuating all their posts in the Lado enclave exceptLado itself, and these stations, so laboriously constructed, so longmaintained, will soon be swallowed by the jungle. The UgandaGovernment also is reducing its garrisons and administration in theNile province, and the traveller sees, not without melancholy, thespectacle of civilization definitely in retreat after more than half acentury of effort and experiment.We disembarked and climbed the slopes through high rank grass andscattered boulders till we stood amidst the rotting bungalows andshanties of what had been a bold bid for the existence of a town.Wadelai had been occupied by white men perhaps for fifty years. Forhalf a century that feeble rush-light of modernity, of cigarettes, ofnewspapers, of whisky and pickles, had burned on the lonely banks ofthe White Nile to encourage and beckon the pioneer and settler. Nonehad followed. Now it was extinguished; and yet when I surveyed thespacious landscape with its green expanses, its lofty peaks, itstrees, its verdure, rising from the brink of the mighty and majesticriver, I could not bring myself for a moment to believe thatcivilization has done with the Nile Province or the Lado Enclave, orthat there is no future for regions which promise so much.All through the day we paddled prosperously with the stream. At timesthe Nile lost itself in labyrinths of papyrus, which reproduced theapproaches to Lake Chioga, and through which we threaded a tortuouscourse, with many bumps and brushings at the bends. But more often thebanks were good, firm earth, with here and there beautiful cliffs ofred sandstone, hollowed by the water, and rising abruptly from itsbrim, crowned with luxuriant foliage. In places these cliffs werepierced by narrow roadways, almost tunnels, winding up to the highground, and perfectly smooth and regular in their construction. Theylooked as if they were made on purpose to give access to and from theriver; and so they had been--by the elephants. Legions of water-fowlinhabited the reeds, and troops of cranes rose at the approach of theflotilla. Sometimes we saw great, big pelican kind of birds, almost asbig as a man, standing contemplative on a single leg, and often on thetree-tops a fish-eagle, glorious in bronze and cream, sat sunninghimself and watching for a prey.I stopped once in the hope of catching butterflies, but found none ofdistinction--only a profuse variety of common types, a high level ofmediocrity without beauties or commanders, and swarms of ferociousmosquitoes prepared to dispute the ground against all comers; and itwas nearly four in the afternoon when the launch suddenly jinked tothe left out of the main stream into a small semi-circular bay, fivehundred yards across, and we came to land at 'Hippo Camp.'  [Illustration: THE 'KENIA,' 'JAMES MARTIN,' AND 'GOOD HOPE' NEARING    NIMULE.]  [Illustration: HIPPO CAMP.]We thought it was much too late to attempt any serious shooting thatday. There were scarcely three and a half hours of daylight. But afterthirty-six hours cramped on these little boats a walk through junglewas very attractive; and, accordingly, dividing ourselves intothree parties, we started in three different directions--like thespokes of a wheel. Captain Dickinson, who commanded the escort, wentto the right with the doctor; Colonel Wilson and another officer setout at right angles to the river bank; and I went to the left underthe guidance of our friend the engineer. I shall relate very brieflywhat happened to each of us. The right-hand party got, after an hour'swalking, into a great herd of elephants, which they numbered at oversixty. They saw no very fine bulls; they found themselves surroundedon every side by these formidable animals; and, the wind being shifty,the hour late, and the morrow free, they judged it wise to return tocamp without shooting. The centre party, consisting of Colonel Wilsonand his companion, came suddenly, after about a mile and a half'swalk, upon a fine solitary bull elephant. They stalked him for sometime, but he moved off, and, on perceiving himself followed, suddenly,without the slightest warning on his part and no great provocation ontheirs, he threw up his trunk, trumpeted, and charged furiously downupon them; whereupon they just had time to fire their rifles in hisface and spring out of his path. This elephant was followed for somemiles, but it was not for three months afterwards that we learned thathe had died of his wounds and that the natives had recovered histusks.So much for my friends. Our third left party prowled off, slantinggradually away inland from the river's bank. It was a regular wildscrub country, with high grass and boulders and many moderate-sizedtrees and bushes, interspersed every hundred yards or so by muchbigger ones. Near the Nile extensive swamps, with reeds fifteen feethigh, ran inland in long bays and fingers, and these, we were told,were the haunts of white rhino. We must have walked along warily andlaboriously for nearly three-quarters of an hour, when I saw through aglade at about two hundred yards distance a great dark animal. Judgingfrom what I had seen in East Africa, I was quite sure it was arhinoceros. We paused, and were examining it carefully with ourglasses, when all of a sudden it seemed to treble in size, and thespreading of two gigantic ears--as big, they seemed, as the flaps ofFrench windows--proclaimed the presence of the African elephant. Thenext moment another and another and another came into view, swingingleisurely along straight towards us--and the wind was almost deadwrong.We changed our position by a flank march of admirable celerity, andfrom the top of a neighbouring ant-bear hill watched, at the distanceof about one hundred and fifty yards, the stately and awe-inspiringprocession of eleven elephants. On they came, loafing along from footto foot--two or three tuskers of no great merit, several largetuskless females, and two or three calves. On the back of everyelephant sat at least one beautiful white egret, and sometimes threeor four, about two feet high, who pecked at the tough hide--I presumefor very small game--or surveyed the scene with the consciousness ofpomp. These sights are not unusual to the African hunter. Those whodwell in the wilderness are the heirs of its wonders. But to me Iconfess it seemed a truly marvellous and thrilling experience towander through a forest peopled by these noble Titans, to watch theirmysterious, almost ghostly, march, to see around on every side, inlarge trees snapped off a few feet from the ground, in enormousbranches torn down for sport, the evidences of their giant strength.And then, while we watched them roam down towards the water, I heard asoft swishing sound immediately behind us, and turning saw, not fortyyards away, a splendid full-grown rhinoceros, with the long, thin hornof his rare tribe upon him--the famous white rhinoceros--Burchellhimself--strolling placidly home after his evening drink and utterlyunconscious of the presence of stranger or foe!We had very carefully judged our wind in relation to the elephants. Itwas in consequence absolutely wrong in relation to the rhinoceros. Isaw that in another fifty yards he would walk right across it. For myown part, perched upon the apex of a ten-foot ant-bear cone, I needhave no misgivings. I was perfectly safe. But my companions, and thenative orderlies and sailors who were with us, enjoyed no suchsecurity. The consequences of not killing the brute at that range andwith that wind would have been a mad charge directly through ourparty. A sense of responsibility no doubt restrained me; but I mustalso confess to the most complete astonishment at the unexpectedapparition. While I was trying to hustle the others by signals andwhispers into safer places; the rhino moved steadily, crossed the lineof wind, stopped behind a little bush for a moment, and then, warnedof his danger, rushed off into the deepest recesses of the jungle. Ihad thrown away the easiest shot I ever had in Africa. Meanwhile theelephants had disappeared.  [Illustration: MR. CHURCHILL ON THE OBSERVATION LADDER AT HIPPO CAMP.]  [Illustration: BANK OF THE VICTORIA NILE.]We returned with empty hands and beating hearts to camp, not withoutchagrin at the opportunity which had vanished, but with the keenestappetite and the highest hopes for the morrow. Thus in three hours andwithin four miles of our landing-place our three separate parties hadseen as many of the greatest wild animals as would reward the wholeexertion of an ordinary big-game hunt. As I dropped off to sleep thatnight in the little _Kisingiri_, moored in the bay, and heard thegrunting barks of the hippo floating and playing all around, minglingwith the cries of the birds and the soft sounds of wind and water, theAfrican forest for the first time made an appeal to my heart,enthralling, irresistible, never to be forgotten.At the earliest break of day we all started in the same order, andwith the sternest resolves. During the night the sailors hadconstructed out of long bamboo poles a sort of light tripod, which,serving as a tower of observation, enabled us to see over the top ofthe high grass and reeds, and this proved of the greatest convenienceand advantage, troublesome though it was to drag along. We spent thewhole morning prowling about, but the jungle, which twelve hoursbefore had seemed so crowded with game of all kinds, seemed nowutterly denuded. At last, through a telescope from a tree-top, we saw,or thought we saw, four or five elephants, or big animals of somekind, grazing about two miles away. They were the other side of anenormous swamp, and to approach them required not only traversingthis, but circling through it for the sake of the wind.We plunged accordingly into this vast maze of reeds, following thetwisting paths made through them by the game, and not knowing what wemight come upon at every step. The ground under foot was quite firmbetween the channels and pools of mud and water. The air was stifling.The tall reeds and grasses seemed to smother one; and above, throughtheir interlacement, shone the full blaze of the noonday sun. To wadeand waddle through such country carrying a double-barrelled ·450rifle, not on your shoulder, but in your hands for instant service,peering round every corner, suspecting every thorn-bush, for at leasttwo hours, is not so pleasant as it sounds. We emerged at last on thefarther side under a glorious tree, whose height had made it ourbeacon in the depths of the swamp, and whose far-spreading branchesoffered a delicious shade.It was three o'clock. We had been toiling for nine hours and had seennothing--literally nothing. But from this moment our luck wasbrilliant. First we watched two wild boars playing at fighting in alittle glade--a most delightful spectacle, which I enjoyed for two orthree minutes before they discovered us and fled. Next a dozensplendid water-buck were seen browsing on the crest of a little ridgewithin easy shot, and would have formed the quarry of any day butthis; but our ambition soared above them, and we would not riskdisturbing the jungle for all their beautiful horns. Then, thirdly, wecame slap up against the rhinoceros. How many I am not certain--four,at least. We had actually walked past them as they stood shelteringunder the trees. Now, here they were, sixty yards away to the leftrear--dark, dim, sinister bodies, just visible through the wavinggrass.When you fire a heavy rifle in cold blood it makes your teeth clatterand your head ache. At such a moment as this one is almost unconsciousalike of report and recoil. It might be a shot-gun. The nearest rhinowas broadside on. I hit him hard with both barrels, and down he went,to rise again in hideous struggles--head, ears, horn flourishedagonizingly above the grass, as if he strove to advance, while Iloaded and fired twice more. That was all I saw myself. Two otherrhinos escaped over the hill, and a fourth, running the other way,charged the native sailors carrying our observation tower, who werevery glad to drop it and scatter in all directions.  [Illustration: MR. CHURCHILL AND BURCHELL'S WHITE RHINOCEROS.]To shoot a good specimen of the white rhinoceros is an eventsufficiently important in the life of a sportsman to make the day onwhich it happens bright and memorable in his calendar. But moreexcitement was in store for us before the night. About a mile from thespot where our victim lay we stopped to rest and rejoice, and, notleast, refresh. The tower of observation--which had been draggedso painfully along all day--was set up, and, climbing it, I saw atonce on the edge of the swamp no fewer than four more full-grownrhinoceros, scarcely four hundred yards away. A tall ant-hill, withineasy range, gave us cover to stalk them, and the wind was exactlyright. But the reader has dallied long enough in this hunter'sparadise. It is enough to say that we killed two more of thesemonsters, while one escaped into the swamp, and the fourth chargedwildly down upon us and galloped through our party without apparentlybeing touched himself or injuring any one. Then, marking the placeswhere the carcasses lay, we returned homeward through the swamp, tootriumphant and too tired to worry about the enraged fugitives wholurked in its recesses. It was very late when we reached home, and ourfriends had already hewn the tusks out of a good elephant whichColonel Wilson had shot, and were roasting a buck which hadconveniently replenished our larder.  [Illustration: COLONEL WILSON'S ELEPHANT.]  [Illustration: THE 'KENIA,' 'JAMES MARTIN,' AND 'GOOD HOPE' ON THE    WHITE NILE.]Such was our day at Hippo Camp, to which the ardent sportsman isrecommended to repair, when he can get some one to show him the way.FOOTNOTE:[1] 'I am informed by the courtesy of Mr. Lydekker of the BritishNatural History Museum, that the true name of the white rhinocerosfound in Uganda is _Rhinoceros Simus Cottoni_. 'Burchell's whiterhinoceros' is the designation of the southern race; but I havepreserved in the text the name commonly used in Uganda.'
ESTP	 XDOWN THE WHITE NILEWe lingered lovingly around Hippo camp for two more days, moving toother lagoons and overflows of the river with the launch, and strikingout inland in search of the great herd of elephants. But althoughtheir recent presence was on all sides proclaimed by snapped-off treesand trampled ground, and broad lanes cut through the grass, we sawnone of them; and a tribe of natives who helped to carry home avariety of buck one afternoon, informed us upon expert authority thatthe whole herd had been alarmed by the arrival of strangers and thesound of firing, and had retired three days' journey from the river'sbank. These natives--of the Lado Enclave--were gentleman-like folk,and I parleyed long with them upon their affairs. They were starknaked and very dignified, with graceful athletic bodies, longtapering well-bred hands, and bright keen eyes. The local chiefexhibited all these characteristics in a superior degree, and hisnatural preeminence was recognized with instantaneous obedience by hisfollowers. We loaded them with gifts. First, quantities of meat andhides; then chocolate all round--they love sweet things--three piecesof sugar for each, at least one empty bottle per man, and tin pots andcard-board boxes almost without limit. The chief showed a fine tastein all these things, and annexed at once in the Imperial stylewhatever took his fancy, to whomsoever it belonged. I cast about forsome means of doing him especial honour, and luckily remembered that Ihad bought a Japanese _kimono_ for a dressing-gown in passing throughPort Said on the journey out. With this he was forthwith enrobed, andI must say he assumed the flowing garment with that easy grace andnatural self-possession which are the gifts of a wilderness life. Thusthe fabrics of Cathay were by the enterprise of Europe introduced intothe heart of Africa.When, finally, with much reluctance we left this attractive place andpushed off determinedly into the stream, we lost no time in makingNimule. Steaming throughout the night and all next day along a broadflood contained by high and healthy slopes--now clothed with forest,now with waving grass--we approached, at about four in the afternoon,the mountains beneath which is the administrative station of Nimule.Hitherto the course of the Nile since it left the Albert Lake had beensmooth and open--a broad, steady-flowing river everywhere navigable tovessels of not more than four feet draught. But at Nimule, after areach of more than a hundred and seventy miles of unobstructedwaterway, the river turns a sharp right angle and enters a longsuccession of granite gorges, through which it plunges in ceaselesscataract for a hundred and twenty miles. It is here at the head ofthese rapids that one of the great reservoirs of the Upper Nile mustsome day be constructed. 'I spent hours,' said Sir William Willcocks,the 'practical mystic' of hydraulic engineering, 'looking at the site,and seeing in a vision a great regulating work of the future.' Andindeed the exact scientific control of the whole vast system ofCentral African waters, of the levels of every lake, of the flow ofevery channel, from month to month and from day to day throughout theyear, is a need so obvious and undisputed as to leave argumentunemployed.The change in the character of the river separated us finally from ourflotilla. From Nimule to Gondokoro we must again proceed by land, andthe swift and easy progress of the last few days must be exchanged forthe steady grind of marches. It was this stage which had always beenpainted to me as the most dangerous and unhealthy in our wholejourney, and I had pictured to myself eight days of toil through swampand forest amid miasma and mosquitoes. These anticipations were notsustained. Of the disadvantages of the track along the river bank Icannot speak; but the upper road over the hills is certainly excellentand healthy, and runs throughout over firm dry undulations of abright, breezy, scrub-covered country.At Nimule we touched the telegraph wire again, and from the Reuter'saccumulations which I studied, I learned that Parliament would notmeet till the 19th of January. This gave another ten days' more rope,and I began to realize how much the spirit of these wonderful landshad taken possession of me, for it was only with the greatestreluctance and difficulty, that I forced myself to continue myhomeward journey without first turning back with the launch andcircumnavigating Lake Albert. No exertion or inconvenience seemed toogreat to win a few more glimpses of these enchanted seas and gardens,on which I may perhaps not look again, but from whose spell I cannever be free. Porters to be fed from day to day, the Sirdar's steamerwaiting at the Soudan frontier, public meetings looming heavily in thefar-off distance, drove me onward; and with feelings of keen andgenuine regret we addressed ourselves to the march to Gondokoro.  [Illustration: FORDING THE ASUA.]This was accomplished uneventfully in six stages, three of which weredouble marches. The country was pleasant and healthy, the sceneryimposing, and, under a fierce sun, the air was cool. Each morning westarted before dawn, and by noon had camped by the side of one of thetributary rivers or streams which flow into the Nile. Of these theAsua was the most important, and the picture of the long _safari_fording it and coming into camp among the palm-trees of the southernbank is one which lingers pleasantly in my memory. But this I mustsay--somehow after Nimule the charm was broken, and none of theregions through which the traveller passes in the long-drawn descentof the Nile revive in any degree those delicious sensations of wonderand novelty which are associated with the great lakes and the kingdomsof Uganda, Usoga, and Unyoro, to say nothing of what I have not beenfortunate enough to see--Toro, Ankole, the Semliki, and the Mountainsof the Moon.At the end of the sixth day we arrived at Gondokoro. The last marchhad been long and scorching. The moisture seemed to have gone from theair, and the vegetation, abundant though it was, seemed parched andstunted. The approaches to Gondokoro are beset by a herd of threehundred elephants of peculiar ill-fame. Nearly all the eligibletuskers have been killed. The females and young bulls are fierce andwary, and, taught by frequent contact with the white man, andprotected by the sacred game laws, exercise a lawless and tyrannicalpower over the whole region. On every side their depredations are tobe seen. Great trees pushed over in careless sport, native plantationstrampled into ruin, the roads rendered precarious for the traveller,the mails often interrupted for days at a time, and occasional loss oflife, are the features of this domination. And it seems likely to lasta long time, for I was informed that the young bulls would not besufficiently grown for about forty years, and even then, as the twowhite officers in the station are not allowed to shoot more than oneelephant apiece each year, the nuisance will only gradually be abated.Rogue elephants are of course fair game at any time, and the daybefore we arrived at Gondokoro, the young civil officer of the stationhad encountered one in a manner which he was scarcely likely toforget. For, having pursued this evil-doer for some time, he at lastgot into an excellent position, and was about to fire at a distance ofthirty yards when suddenly the elephant, without even trumpetingrushed furiously upon him, and, paying no attention to the two heavybullets which struck him in the head, chased the officer twice roundan uncommonly small bush; and then, distracted by the spectacle of thenative gun-bearer in flight, turned off after this new prey, and,overtaking the poor wretch, smashed him to pieces with one blow ofhis terrible trunk. 'Cet animal est très méchant; quand on l'attaque,il se défend.' We reached the bungalow, which serves as the seat ofgovernment, in time to see the tusks of this man-slayer, who had diedof his wounds, brought in by the tribe whose plantations he had sooften ravaged.Gondokoro, like most of the names which figure so imposingly upon theAfrican map, is not a numerously populated town. There are about sixhouses and a number of native huts. There is, however, a telegraphstation, a prison, a court-house, and the lines of a company of nativepolice and King's African Rifles. Here the Nile again becomesnavigable, and offers an unbroken waterway open to large vessels untilthe Shabluka cataract is reached, a hundred miles below Khartoum andfifteen hundred miles from Gondokoro. And here at the river's bank,seen through a tracery of palms, were the white funnel andsuperstructure of the Sirdar's steamer with all the letters andnewspapers; and which, instead of pursuing us across Uganda, had 'comethrough the other way.''Had come through the other way'--it is an easy phrase to write: buthow much it signifies in the modern history of Africa! Ten or elevenyears ago this journey which I was now able to make so easily, soprosperously, so comfortably, would have been utterly impossible. TheDervish empire, stretching from Wady Halfa or Abu Hamed to Wadelai,interposed a harsh barrier which nothing but a stricken field couldsweep away; and these long reaches of the Nile which now bore a fleetof fifty steamers were silent in the embrace of a devastatingbarbarism. A grim slaughter which had strewn the sands of Kerreri,twelve hundred miles to the North, with _jibba_-clad corpses 'likesnow-drifts' had blasted a passage, and the Nile was free.Embarked at Gondokoro we passed out of the sphere of the ColonialOffice into the domain of that undefined joint authority whichregulates the Soudan, which flies two flags side by side on everypublic building, and which you can only correspond with through theBritish Foreign Office.  [Illustration: THE BELGIAN OFFICIALS AT LADO.]  [Illustration: GONDOKORO.]Henceforward our journey was comfortable, and regular. Yet though Ihad no official work to do and was merely coming home the shortestway, I could not traverse the Soudan without the keenest interest.When one has started from Cairo and padded up the Nile to Wady Halfa,crossed the desert railway to the Atbara, marched thence two hundredmiles to the battle of Omdurman, one feels one has seen something ofthe Nile. Yet now we had followed it the other way from its source fornearly five hundred miles, and yet twelve hundred more intervenedbefore even Omdurman was reached; and as the mighty and peerless riverunrolled its length and immemorial history, the feelings of reverence,without which no traveller can drink its sweet waters, grew inintensity.I yield to no one in recognition of the constructive andreconstructive work which Sir Reginald Wingate and his able officershave, with scanty means and in spite of grave military dangers,wrought in the Soudan. Yet it is not possible to descend the Nilecontinuously from its source at Ripon Falls without realizing that thebest lies behind one. Uganda is the pearl. The Nile province and theLado Enclave present splendid and alluring panoramas. Even the marchfrom Nimule to Gondokoro is through a fertile and inspiring region.But thereafter the beauty dies out of the landscape and the richnessfrom the land. We leave the regions of abundant rainfall, ofEquatorial luxuriance, of docile peoples, of gorgeous birds andbutterflies and flowers. We enter stern realms of sinister andforbidding aspect, where nature is cruel and sterile, where man isfanatical and often rifle-armed. Cultivation--nay, vegetation, is buta strip along the river bank: and even there thorn-bushes and pricklyaloes are its chief constituents. We enter two successive deserts ascontrasted in their character, as redoubtable in their inhospitality,as Dante's Circles of the Inferno: the Desert of Sudd and the Desertof Sand.  [Illustration: REVIEW AT KHARTOUM.]  [Illustration: SOUDAN GOVERNMENT STEAMER 'DAL.']About a hundred miles from Gondokoro the White Nile enters and spillsitself in a vast and appalling swamp. Of the action of this tremendoussponge, whether beneficial in regulating the flow, or harmful inwasting the water through evaporation, nothing need here be said. Butits aspect is at once so dismal and so terrifying that to travelthrough it is a weird experience. Our steamer, with the favouringcurrent, made at least seven miles an hour, and, as the moon was full,we travelled night and day. For three days and three nights we werecontinuously in this horrible swamp into which the whole of the UnitedKingdom could be easily packed. By day from the roof of the highpilot-house a commanding view revealed hour after hour, in everydirection, one uninterrupted ocean of floating vegetation spreading tofar horizons. The papyrus-plant is in itself a beautiful, graceful,and venerable thing. To travel through the _sudd_, is to hate it forevermore. Rising fifteen feet above the level of the water, stretchingits roots twenty or even thirty feet below, and so matted and tangledtogether that elephants can walk safely upon its springy surface,papyrus is the beginning and end of this melancholy world. Forhundreds of miles nothing else is to be perceived--not amountain-ridge blue on the horizon, scarcely a tree, no habitation ofman, no sign of beast. The silence is broken only by the croaking ofinnumerable frog armies, and the cry of dreary birds.The vigorous operations of the _sudd_-cutters have opened, and theconstant traffic of steamers has preserved and improved, a channelabout a hundred yards wide, winding by loops and corkscrews throughthe swamp. The river presents a depth of thirty feet along thiscourse, and greater vessels could thread its length for nearly athousand miles. The navigation is intricate and peculiar. Indeed, itwould seem to be an art by itself. No effort is made by the Arabpilots, who alone are employed, to avoid collisions with the banks. Onthe contrary, they rely upon them as an essential feature of theirmanagement of the steamer. The vessel bumps regularly at almost everycorner from one cushion of _sudd_ to the other, or plunges its noseinto the reeds and waits for the currents to carry its stern round,bumps again and recovers its direction. Sometimes where the twistswere very sharp we would turn completely round, not once but two orthree times, and our movements round an S-curve were even morecomplicated. The bumps occasionally swept us out of our chairs andsent us sprawling on the deck. In this strange fashion we waltzedalong at full speed for about seventy or eighty hours.Meanwhile the Nile was accomplishing its destiny. Its vast tributaryrivers, the Sobat and the Bahr-el-Ghazal, came to reinforce its flow.The miles spread out behind us in a long succession of hundreds. Atlength the _sudd_ expanses begin to contract. Distant mountains riseagainst the steel-blue sky in serrated silhouette, and gradually drawin upon the river. Islands of earth and trees, peaks of sharp rockbreak here and there the awful monotony of waving reeds. At last thebanks become firm and clear-cut walls of yellow sand, fringed inplaces with palms and shady trees, and everywhere bristling withundergrowth of thorns. We leave the wilderness of moisture, weapproach the wilderness of drought. But first, in a middle region,vast areas of dusty scrub-covered plains, not wholly incapable ofcultivation in the rainy season, supporting always flocks and herds,now flank both sides of the river. The camel caravans pad slowlyacross them under the blaze and glitter of the heat. The mirage beginsto twist and blur the landscape with deceptive waters. At intervals offorty or fifty miles are the stations of the Soudan Government, eachtrim and regular with its public buildings, its storehouses, the linesof beehive huts of its garrison, a tangle of native sailing-craft, andalways, or nearly always, one or two white gunboats of war-time daysnow turned policemen of the river.Thus we reach in time Fashoda--now called Kodok for old sake's sake;and here are clusters of Shillooks who (by request) stand pensively onone leg in their natural attitude, and smart companies of Soudanesetroops and British officers, civil and military--the whole clear-cutunder sun-blaze dry light, veiled only in dancing dust-devilspiteously whipped by strong hot winds. All this was like a piece ofthe Omdurman campaign to me--the old familiar Soudan, so often madeknown to British minds by pen, pencil, and photograph during nearlytwenty years of war, unfolded itself feature by feature. Yet we werestill five hundred miles south of Khartoum!  [Illustration: A SHELUK AT KODOK (FASHODA).]At Meshra-er-Zeraf we stopped for two days to shoot, by the Sirdar'sinvitation, in the extensive game reserve, and were fortunate insecuring a buffalo and various antelope. We wandered through a harshcountry, of white sand and tussocks of coarse grass, more grey thangreen, with leafless black thorn-trees densely tangled; yet it seemedfull of game. In three hours' walk on the second morning I shot a finewaterbuck, two reed-bucks, and two of a beautiful herd of roanantelope, who walked slowly down to water past our ambuscade. And,be it remembered, that the pleasure and excitement of such sport arein these lands always heightened by the possibility that at any momentthe hunters may come upon game of much more serious quality--lion orbuffalo; so that no one cares to be more than a few yards from hisheavy rifle or give his mind wholly to the buck he stalks. Surely theyare perverse, unenterprising folk who spend fortunes each year inpreserving with so much artificial care, and to the inconvenience ofother dwellers in a small island, well-counted herds of more or lesstame deer, when in a month, and for less expense than the year's rentof their forests, they could pursue wild animals of every kind intheir natural haunts and gain experiences that would last them alltheir lives.I was so much elated by this jolly morning's sport and the nearapproach of civilized conditions--for after all, contrast is anelement in pleasure--that I permitted myself to rejoice at the safeand happy outcome of this long journey, and to exult in our completeimmunity from serious accident or illness or even fever. Howextravagant were the accounts of the dangers of African travel! Howeasy to avoid the evil chances of the road! Reasonable precautions,steady exercise, regular quinine--were these not in themselves theguarantees of safety? Thus I reckoned, and with specious reasons, butin a bad hour. We were not yet at our journey's end.Twenty-four hours' steaming from Meshra-er-Zeraf brought us nearKhartoum. The character of the country was unchanged. Yellowsand-slopes drank at the Nile brim; thorn-scrub fringed the river oneither side; but date-palms mingled even more frequently andnumerously with the vegetation, and brown mud-built villages withbrown mud-coloured populations multiplied as the miles slipped swiftlyby. At length a solitary majestic tree, beneath whose spaciousbranches and luxuriant foliage a hundred persons might have foundshelter from the relentless sun--Gordon's tree--advertised us of theproximity of Khartoum. Soon on the one bank came into view the vastmud labyrinth of Omdurman, with forests of masts rising along theshore, and on the other, among palm-groves ever clustering thicker,sprang the blue and pink and crimson minarets of new Khartoum.Khartoum--the new Khartoum, risen from its ruins in wealth andbeauty--a smiling city sitting like a queen throned at theconfluence of the Niles, the heart and centre of a far-reaching andformidable authority, disclosed herself to the traveller's eye. Sharpto the right turns the steamer, leaving the dull placid waters of thesovereign river we have so long followed, and shouldering a moreturbulent current of clearer water, swings up-stream along its noblefeudatory, the Blue Nile. And passing by the side of high stoneembankments crowned by palms, the steamer enters into a modernOriental port and city, and is soon surrounded by its palaces, itsmosques, its warehouses and its quays.  [Illustration: THE PALACE, KHARTOUM.]Nearly ten years have passed since the Dervish domination wasirretrievably shattered on the field of Omdurman, and every year hasbeen attended by steady and remarkable progress in every sphere ofgovernmental activity in every province of the Soudan. Order has beenestablished, and is successfully, though precariously, maintained evenin the remotest parts of Kordofan. The railway has reached theSouthern bank of the Blue Nile, connects Khartoum with Cairo and withthe Red Sea, waits only for the construction of a bridge to cross theriver and enter the fertile regions of the Ghezireh. A numerous fleetof steamers maintains swift and regular communication along the greatwaterways. The revenue has risen from a few thousands a year in 1899to considerably over a million pounds in 1907. Improved methods ofagriculture have increased the wealth of the country; the preventionof massacre and famine has begun to restore its population. Slaveryhas been abolished, and without affronting the religion or seriouslydisturbing the customs of the people, a measure of education andcraftsmanship has been introduced.These great changes which are apparent throughout the whole Soudan arenowhere presented in so striking and impressive form as in thecapital. A spacious palace, standing in a beautiful garden, has risenfrom the ruins where Gordon perished. Broad thoroughfares lighted byelectricity, and lined with excellent European shops, lead withgeometrical precision through the city. A system of steam tramways inconnection with ferry boats, patronized chiefly by the natives,renders communication easy throughout Khartoum, and between Khartoum,Omdurman, and Halfyah. A semi-circle of substantial barracks, arrangedupon a defensive scheme, protects the landward approaches. TheGordon College hums with scholarly activity--Moslem and Christian,letters or crafts; and seven thousand soldiers of all dress march pastthe British and Egyptian flags on occasions of ceremony.  [Illustration: GEORGE SCRIVINGS.]Yet neither these inspiring facts--the more impressive by contrastwith my memories of ten years before--nor the gracious hospitality ofthe Sirdar--more responsible than any other man for the whole of thistremendous task of reconstruction and revival--were to prevent me fromtaking away a sombre impression of Khartoum. As our steamer approachedthe landing-stage I learned that my English servant, George Scrivings,had been taken suddenly ill, and found him in a condition ofprostration with a strange blue colour under his skin. Good doctorswere summoned. The hospital of Khartoum, with all its resources, wasat hand. There appeared no reason to apprehend a fatal termination.But he had been seized by a violent internal inflammation, the resultof eating some poisonous thing which we apparently had escaped, anddied early next morning after fifteen hours' illness, with almostevery symptom of Asiatic cholera.Too soon, indeed, had I ventured to rejoice. Africa always claims itsforfeits; and so the four white men who had started together fromMombasa returned but three to Cairo. A military interment involves theunion of the two most impressive rituals in the world. The day afterthe Battle of Omdurman it fell to my lot to bury those soldiers of the21st Lancers, who had died of their wounds during the night. Now afternine years, in very different circumstances, from the other end ofAfrica, I had come back to this grim place where so much blood hasbeen shed, and again I found myself standing at an open grave, whilethe yellow glare of the departed sun still lingered over the desert,and the sound of funeral volleys broke its silence.       *       *       *       *       *The remainder of our journey lay in tourist lands, and the comfortablesleeping-cars of the Desert Railway, and the pleasant passengersteamers of the Wady Haifa and Assouan reach soon carried usprosperously and uneventfully to Upper Egypt; and so to Cairo, London,and the rest.  [Illustration: PHILAE.]
ESTP	 XITHE VICTORIA AND ALBERT RAILWAYMy journey is at an end, the tale is told, and the reader who hasfollowed so faithfully and so far has a right to ask what message Ibring back. It can be stated in three words. Concentrate upon Uganda!Over the greater part of the north-east quarter of Africa, Britishinfluence or authority in one form or another is supreme. But when Iturn my mind over all those vast expanses, excluding only Egypt, thereis no region which offers prospects to compare in hopefulness withthose of the Protectorate of Uganda. The Soudan is far greater inextent and importance, and Great Britain is at no charge in respect toit. But the Soudan is clearly inferior in fertility. The East AfricanProtectorate possesses not only enormous coast-lands of great value,but noble plateaux where the air is as cool as an English spring. Butwe already spend on East Africa--and upon the needs of its expensivewhite settlers--more than the whole revenue of Uganda; and yet thepromise is not so bright. Northern Somaliland is a desert of rocks andthorn bushes peopled by rifle-armed fanatics, on which we spend nearlyhalf as much as the whole annual grant-in-aid of Uganda. And betweenSomaliland and Uganda there is this contrast presented in its crudestform--a barren land with dangerous inhabitants; and a fruitful landwith a docile people. What is least worth having, is most difficult tohold: what is most worth having, is easiest.The union under scientific direction in Uganda (and I include in thispopular name Usoga, Unyoro, Toro and Ankole, etc.) of unequalledfertility with a population of high intelligence and social quality,in a region of extraordinary waterways, must, unless some grievouserror or neglect should intervene, result in remarkable economicdevelopments. Already more than half the traffic which passes down therailway to Mombasa comes from beyond the lake. Yet scarcely any moneyhas ever been spent on Uganda. No European roads exist, no railwayshave been built, no waterfalls are harnessed, no public works of anyserious description have been undertaken. A poor little grant-in-aidhas barely supported the day-to-day cost of European administration,and practically nothing in cash or credit has been available for thedevelopment of the country. But it is alive by itself. It is vital;and in my view, in spite of its insects and its diseases, it ought inthe course of time to become the most prosperous of all our East andCentral African possessions, and perhaps the financial driving wheelof all this part of the world. It is far from my desire to disparagethe East African Protectorate, or to suggest diminution of activity orsupport. Both Protectorates are necessary to each other and shouldadvance together; but in view of their relative positions, and lookingat the situation as it is to-day, my counsel plainly is--'Concentrateupon Uganda!' Nowhere else in Africa will a little money go so far.Nowhere else will the results be more brilliant, more substantial ormore rapidly realized.Cotton alone should make the fortune of Uganda. All the best qualitiesof cotton can be grown in the highest perfection, a hundred thousandintelligent landowners occupying twenty thousand square miles ofsuitable soil are eager to engage in the cultivation. An industriousand organized population offers the necessary labour. Merely at therequest of the Government cotton has been planted experimentally on aconsiderable scale throughout Uganda. The figures of production--thoughof course they are only the first beginnings--show a surprisingexpansion. Great care is required, and steps have already been takento secure that the quality of cotton exported from Uganda is notdeteriorated or its reputation prejudiced by hasty or untutoredaction, that only the seeds which yield the best results should bedistributed, and that no indiscriminate mixture should be permitted.The Government must control the culture. Experts must watch theginneries and educate the native cultivator. Roads must be made toenable the crop to be marketed. The scientific organization of thecotton-growing resources of Uganda has now been definitely undertaken.A special grant of £10,000 a year will in future be devoted to thispurpose, and the whole process will be supervised by European officersin close touch through the Colonial Office with the highestManchester authorities and the British Cotton-Growing Association. Inthe opinion of the ablest observers the next five years will see avery remarkable development in cotton production, even though themeans available to foster it continue to be slender.But cotton is only one of those tropical products for which the demandof civilized industry is almost insatiable, and which can nowhere inthe world be grown more cheaply, more easily, more perfectly thanbetween the waters of the two great lakes. Rubber, fibre, cinnamon,cocoa, coffee, sugar may all be cultivated upon the greatest scale;virgin forests of rare and valuable timber await the axe; and eventhough mineral wealth may perhaps never lend its hectic glory toUganda, the economic foundations of its prosperity will stand securelyupon a rich and varied agriculture. A settler's country it can neverbe. Whatever may be the destinies of the East African Highlands, theshores of the great lakes will never be the permanent residence of awhite race. It is a planter's land, where the labours of the nativepopulation may be organized and directed by superior intelligence andexternal capital. For my own part I rejoice that the physicalconditions of the country are such as to prevent the growth in theheart of happy Uganda of a petty white community, with the harsh andselfish ideas which mark the jealous contact of races and theexploitation of the weaker. Let it remain a 'planter's land.' Let theplanters, instead of being the agents of excited syndicates with mindsabsorbed in the profits of shareholders thousands of miles away, beeither Europeans of substance and character who have given proofs oftheir knowledge of natives and their ability to deal skilfully andjustly with them, or better still--say I--let them be thedisinterested officers of the Government, directing the development ofthe country neither in their own, nor any other pecuniary interest,but for the general good of its people and of the Empire of which itforms a part.But if the immediate inflexion of British policy in Eastern Africashould be, without prejudice, but with precedence of other provinces,to accelerate the economic and social development of Uganda, what arethe first steps to take? I might have much to say of Forestry andAgriculture; of an extended system of technical education similar tothat given at the Gordon College at Khartoum, here perhaps in part tobe achieved through grants in aid of the existing missionary schools;of road-making, indispensable to progress, of motor-transport, and ofwater-power. But let me make my message brief and unclouded, and asbefore expressed in three words, 'Build a Railway.'The clusters of colonial possessions which have been acquired on theeast and west coasts of Africa, so rapidly and with so little cost orbloodshed, will unquestionably prove an invaluable, if not indeed anecessary feature of the British Empire. From these vast plantationswill be drawn the raw materials of many of our most importantindustries; to them will flow a continuous and broadening train ofBritish products; and in them the peculiar gifts for administrationand high civic virtues of our race may find a healthy and anhonourable scope. Some of these great estates, like Southern Nigeriaon the west coast, are already so prosperous as not only to beself-supporting, but able to assist with credit and subvention theprogress of neighbours less far advanced. Others are still a chargeupon our estimates. We are annually put to the expense ofgrants-in-aid more or less considerable for Northern Somaliland, theEast African Protectorate, Nyassaland and Uganda. Heavy upon thefinance of all the East Coast hangs the capital charge of the UgandaRailway. In no way will these charges be eased or removed except bythe rise of one or more of the territories concerned to economicbuoyancy, or by the growth of railway traffic down the Uganda trunkconsequent upon development. Under present conditions the progressmade from year to year is steady and encouraging. The charges upon theColonial Estimates diminish regularly every year. Every year theadministration of the different Governments increases in elaboration,in efficiency and consequently in cost. The extra charge is met evermore fully by the returning yield of a grateful soil. Except for thechances of war, rebellion, pestilence, and famine which brood over theinfancy of tropical protectorates, but which may be averted orcontrolled, it would be easy to calculate a date--not too remote--bywhich all contribution from the British tax-payer would beunnecessary. The movement of events is encouraging; but there is onemethod by which it can be made far more sure and far more swift, bywhich all adverse chances are minimized, and all existing resourcesstimulated and multiplied--railways.I would go so far as to say that it is only wasting time and money totry to govern, or still more develop, a great African possessionwithout a railway. There can be no security, progress, or prosperitywithout at least one central line of rapid communication driventhrough the heart of the country. Where, as in Northern Somaliland,the land itself is utterly valueless, a mere desert of rocks andscrub, or where the military dangers are excessive and utterlydisproportioned to any results that can ever be reaped--withdrawal andconcentration are the true policy. But if for any reason it be decidedto remain and to administer, a railway becomes the prime of absolutenecessities. Till then all civilized government is extravagant andprecarious, and all profitable commerce practically impossible. Theseconsiderations have lately led a British Government to sanction theextensive railways, nearly 600 miles long, now being rapidlyconstructed in Northern and Southern Nigeria; and the same argumentsapply, though in my view with increased force, to the UgandaProtectorate.It is not usually realized that the Uganda railway does not passthrough Uganda. It is the railway _to_ Uganda and not _of_ Uganda. Itstops short of the land from which it takes its name, and fallsexhausted by its exertions and vicissitudes, content feverishly to lapthe waters of the Victoria Nyanza. Uganda is reached, but nottraversed by steam communication in any form. Yet the extension of therailway from the western shores of the Victoria to the Albert Nyanzawould not only carry it through much of the most valuable and fertilecountry within its radius, but as I shall show could far more thandouble its effective scope.It may be accepted as an axiom that in the present state ofdevelopment in these African protectorates, it is scarcely ever, andindeed I think never, worth while to build railways in competitionwith waterways. Railways should in new countries be in supplement of,and not in substitution for, lakes and navigable rivers. No doubtdirect through-routes of railway, where bulk is not broken and alldelays and changings are avoided, show an imposing advantage incomparison with a mere alternation of water stages and railway links.There could be no doubt which was the better if only you leave outthe question of cost. But it is just this question of cost whichcannot be left out, which clamorously dominates the proposition fromthe beginning. For first-class countries may afford first-classrailways and _trains de luxe_, but second-class countries must be lessambitious, and young new jungle-born countries are satisfied, or oughtto be, if they get any railway at all. The differences between thebest railway in the world and the worst, are no doubt impressive; butthey become utterly insignificant when contrasted with the differencebetween the worst railway in the world and no railway at all. Forobserve, the comparison is not with perfect lines of Europeancommunication, nor with anything like them, nor even with a waggon ona turnpike road. It is with a jogging, grunting, panting, failing lineof tottering coolies, men reduced to beasts of burden, that the newpioneer line must be compared--that is to say, with the most painful,most degrading, slowest and feeblest method of transportation whichhas ever disgraced the world. And compared with that, any line ofsteam-communication, however primitive, however light, howeverinterrupted, is heaven.I am endeavouring to guide the reader to a positive proposal of amodest and practical character, I mean the construction of a newrailway which might be called 'The Victoria and Albert Railway,'although it would virtually be an extension of the existing Ugandaline. This railway should traverse the country between the greatlakes, and join together these two noble reservoirs with all theirrespective river connections. The distance is not great. Two hundredand fifty miles would exceed the largest computation; and perhaps aline of one hundred and fifty miles would suffice. If the cost of thisrailway were estimated, as I am informed is reasonable, at a maximumfigure of £5,000 a mile, the total sum involved would be between£1,250,000 and £750,000.The supreme advantage of making a railway debouch upon a great lake,is that every point on the lake shore is instantly put in almost equalcommunication with railhead. Steamers coast round on circular tours,and whatsoever trade or traffic may offer along the wholecircumference, is carried swiftly to the railway. Lakes are in factthe catchment areas of trade, and it is by tapping and uniting themthat the economic life of Central Africa can be most easily andswiftly stimulated.Two routes present themselves with various competing advantages bywhich the Victoria and Albert Railway may proceed. The first, the mostobvious, most desirable and most expensive, is straight across theHighlands of Toro, through the best of the cotton country, from apoint on the Victoria Lake in the neighbourhood of Entebbe, to wherethe Semliki river runs into the southern end of Lake Albert. Thesecond would practically follow the footsteps recorded in these pages.It does not offer a direct line. It does not pass during the whole ofits length through cultivated and inhabited country. It does not reachthe Albert Lake at the most convenient end. But it is far cheaper thanthe other. It is only 135 miles long instead of nearly 250. Itconnects not only the two great lakes, but also Lake Chioga with allits channels and tributaries, in one system of unbroken steamcommunication.Briefly this latter project would consist of two links of railway: thefirst about sixty miles long from Jinja (or Ripon Falls) to Kakindu,the first point where the Victoria Nile becomes navigable: the secondabout seventy-five miles long from the neighbourhood of Mruli to theNile below the Murchison Falls and near its mouth on the Albert. Bythese two sections of railway, together only 135 miles in length, awonderful extent of waterways would be commanded; to wit: 1. Thirtymiles of the Victoria Nile navigable from Kakindu to Lake Chioga. 2.Lake Chioga itself, with its long arms and gulfs stretching deeplyinto the whole of the fertile regions to the south-west of MountElgon, and affording a perimeter of navigable coastline accessible bysteamers, of certainly not less than 250 miles. 3. All that reach ofthe Victoria Nile navigable from Lake Chioga to Foweira when therapids ending in the Murchison Falls begin again--70 miles. 4. Thirtymiles from below the falls to the Albert Lake. 5. The whole of theAlbert Lake shores--250 miles. 6. The Semliki river navigable (once asandbar has been passed) for sixty miles. 7. The glorious open reachof the White Nile from the Albert Lake to Nimule--120 miles. Thus bythe construction of only 135 miles of railroad, swift moderncommunication would be established over a total range of 800 miles: orfor an addition of one-fifth to its length and one-eighth to its costthe effective radius of the Uganda railway would be more than doubled.Such railway propositions are few and far between.I do not prejudge the choice of these two routes. Both are now beingcarefully surveyed. The advantages of the longer and more ambitiousline across Toro are perhaps superior. But the cost is also nearlytwice as great; and cost is a vital factor--not merely to thegovernment called upon to find money, but still more to the commercialsoundness of an enterprise which is permanently crippled, if itsoriginal capital charges are allowed notably to exceed what theestimated earnings would sustain. The question is one which willrequire severe and patient examination, the nicest balancings betweencompetitive advantages, the smoothest compromises between thepractical and the ideal.But let us now look forward to a time--not, I trust, remote--when byone route or the other the distance between the Victoria and AlbertLakes has been spanned by a railway, and when the Mountains of theMoon are scarcely four days' journey from Mombasa. The BritishGovernment will then be possessed of the shortest route to theEastern Congo. The Uganda railway will be able to offer rates formerchandise and railway material with which no other line that canever be constructed will ever be able to compete. The whole of thatalready considerable, though as yet stifled trade, which feeblytrickles back half across Africa by Boma to the Atlantic, which islooking desperately for an outlet to the northward, which percolatesin driblets through Uganda to-day, will flow swiftly and abundantly tothe benefit of all parties concerned down the Uganda trunk, raisingthat line with steady impulse from the _status_ of a political railwaytowards the level of a sound commercial enterprise. In no other waywill the British tax-payer recover his capital. The advantages aregreat and the expense moderate. Larger considerations may postpone,and the imperative need of the fullest surveys will in any case delayconstruction; but I cannot doubt that the Victoria and Albert railwayis now the most important project awaiting action in the whole of thatgroup of Protectorates which Sir Frederick Lugard used proudly to call'our East African Empire.'But let us proceed one step further in the development of thecommunications of north-east Africa. When an extension of the Ugandarailway has reached the Albert Nyanza, only one link will be missingto connect the whole of the rail and waterway system of East Africaand Uganda with the enormous system of railways and riverways of Egyptand the Soudan, to connect the Uganda with the Desert railway, to jointhe navigation of the great lakes to the navigation of the Blue andWhite Niles. Only one link will be missing, and that a very short one;the distance of 110 miles from Nimule to Gondokoro, where the Nile isinterrupted by cataracts. Of the commercial utility of such a link _initself_ I have nothing to say; but as a means of marrying two giganticsystems of steam communication, it will some day possess a highimportance; and thereafter over the whole of the north-east quarter ofthe African continent under the influence or authority of the BritishCrown, comprising a total mileage by rail and river of perhaps 20,000miles, uninterrupted steam communication will prevail.The adventurous and the imaginative may peer out beyond these compactand practicable steps into a more remote and speculative region.Perhaps by the time that the junction between the Uganda and Soudanrail and water systems has been effected, the Rhodes Cape to Cairorailway will have reached the southern end of Lake Tanganyika: andthen only one comparatively short hiatus will bar a completetranscontinental line, if not wholly of railroad, at least of steamtraffic and of comfortable and speedy travel.Then, perhaps it will be time to make another journey; but as thereader, who will no doubt take care to secure a first-class touristticket, will no longer require my services as guide, I shall take thisopportunity of making him my bow.
ESTP	 Ernest Miller was born into an afflu-ent family in the Chicago suburb of Oak Park, Illi-nois, on July 21, 1899, the eldest of six children. Hisfather,  Clarence  Edmond,  was  a  physician.  Hismother, the former Grace Hall, kept an attractivehouse at 439 North Oak Park Avenue, her father’sdwelling, into which her husband moved and liveduntil her father’s death in 1905. Grace exposed herson Ernest to the arts by taking him to museums inChicago  and  by  enrolling  him  in  piano  lessons, as both son and writer, frequently re-belled against her puritanical values.As  a  student  at  Oak  Park  High  School,  fromwhich graduated in 1917, he contrib-uted to the school newspaper and other publica-tions. Upon graduation, he realized that he wouldsoon be in some way drawn into World War I. Hisfirst job, as a reporter for theKansas City Star, wascut short when, after being rejected for militaryservice because of weak eyesight, he enlisted as anambulance driver for the Red Cross early in 1918and was sent to Italy.On July 8, 1918, who served withsome heroism, was wounded by mortar fire at Fos-salta di Piave. He was hospitalized for an extendedperiod, and when he returned to the United States,the dashing, dark-haired  was consid-ered a conquering hero and was in great demandto speak before civic groups about his war experi-ence. He was lionized for his heroism.After recuperating at his family’s summer homein  Michigan, became  a  reporter  fortheToronto StarandStar Weekly, which sent him toEurope as a foreign correspondent in 1921, shortlyafter his marriage to Hadley Richardson. The twosettled in Paris, where they met many of the fore-most contributors to Europe’s avant-garde artisticscene. Among his Parisian associates numbered  Sherwood  Anderson,  Ford  MadoxFord, James Joyce, Ezra Pound, and, perhaps mostsignificant, Gertrude Stein. It was from Stein thathe learned the elements of literary style that werelater to affect his writing most directly began to write short stories and, in1923, publishedThree Stories and Ten Poemsin Paris,followed the next year byIn Our Time, a collectionof short stories, which was republished in 1925 inthe United States. By then, was begin-ning  to  move  away  from  reporting  and  full-timeinto his career.In 1926, he publishedThe Torrents of Springandhis  renowned  novel  of  the  so-called  lost  genera-tion,The Sun Also Rises, with Charles Scribner’s Sonsin  New  York,  which  remained  his  publisher  forall but one of his later books.The Sun Also Riseses-tablished ’s early reputation, althoughreal commercial success evaded him for anothertwo years untilA Farewell to Armsappeared in 1929.Both books showcase his strength: writing aboutmen who responded to adversity in a way that he1068© The Nobel Foundationdefined as courageous. For , couragewas showing grace under pressure.Men Without Womenappeared in 1927, the yearin which divorced Hadley and marriedPauline Pfeiffer. In 1928, decided toreturn to the United States. He and Pauline usedtheir house in Key West, Florida, as their base until1939, although their stays there were interruptedby frequent travel, particularly from 1936 to 1938,when  went to Spain to cover the Span-ish Civil War for the North American NewspaperAlliance.The  Key  West  years  were  productive  ones  for He was happy there and began his ex-tensive adventures as a sport fisherman in the Gulfof Mexico. These were much more elaborate ex-cursions than his cherished childhood fishing andhunting trips with his father in northern Michigan.At about this time, who had experi-enced the running of the bulls at Pamplona, beganto develop his lifelong interest in bullfighting. Hisbook  on  the  subject,Death  in  the  Afternoon,  ap-peared  in  1932,  his  first  to  depart  from  the  wartheme that had come for many to define his writ-ing.  His  major  concern  therein,  however,  is  stillgrace under pressure.Ever seeking new adventures,  tookhis first African safari in 1933-1934; during thesetravels he also revisited Spain and France. HisGreenHills of Africa, published in 1935, resulted from this,his first of many African ventures. Back in Key Westafter the Spanish Civil War ended in 1938, Heming-way was restless, and in 1939, he bought a house,called  Finca  Vigia,  outside  Havana,  Cuba,  andmoved there. ’s obsession with adventure and withproving  his  masculinity—clear  motivations  formany of his more daring adventures—made himdifficult to live with; in 1940, Pauline divorced him.In the same year,For Whom the Bell Tollswas pub-lished, and married newswoman Mar-tha Gellhorn, several years his senior, whom he re-garded  subconsciously  as  a  mother  figure,  as  hemay have done all his wives. His resentment of hisown mother is often said to have manifested itselfin his marriages, directed against the women hechose to marry.With the entry of the United States into WorldWar II,  again went to Europe as a warcorrespondent. He participated in the Allied Nor-mandy invasion, hatched a personal scheme to lib-erate Paris, and attached himself to the Fourth In-fantry  Division,  somewhat  against  the  will  of  itsofficers. When returned to Cuba dur-ing the war, he became a self-appointed antisubma-rine operative, sailing into the ocean on his yachtto spot enemy submarines and disable any he en-countered.The U.S. government was embarrassed by Hem-ingway’s unsolicited help. His literary productiondeclined during this period, and his drinking wasout of control. When Martha Gellhorn divorcedhim in 1944, he quickly married Mary Welsh, whowould remain his wife until, seekingthe same solution to his problems that his fatherhad earlier, committed suicide in 1961.’s artistic end seemed imminent in1950 when his novelAcross the River and into the Treeswas poorly received by critics and the public alike;however, he rallied from that defeat and, in 1952,published one of his most popular works, the no-vellaThe Old Man and the Sea. About a year after thebook was published, survived two air-plane crashes in Africa. Reported dead, he eventu-ally charged out of the bush with a bottle of whiskeyin his hand. In 1954, he was awarded the NobelPrize  in  Literature  but,  because  of  his  injuries,could not attend the awards ceremony. His Nobelcitation, even though the prize is for the full bodyof his literary work, specifically citedThe Old Manand the Seaas exemplifying that which the awardseeks to honor in literature.When Cuba fell to Fidel Castro in 1959, Hem-ingway  bought  his  final  residence,  a  house  inKetchum,  Idaho.  He  moved  there  in  1959,  thesame year in which he began treatments for depres-sion and various physical ills at the Mayo Clinic inRochester, Minnesota. His despondence over hisdeclining health and over his inability to write aswell as he once had led him to end his life on July 2,1961, by putting a twelve-gauge shotgun into hismouth and pulling the trigger.AnalysisDuring ’s formative years, his mothertried to civilize her son. His father, when he couldtake time away from his medical practice to be withhis family at its summer home near Petosky, Michi-gan, exposed to such sporting activi-ties as hunting, fishing, and living in the woods.Ernest , never a large man, endured an adoles-cence of viewing the world from the perspective ofsomeone five feet, four inches tall. This early per-spective eventually made itself felt in his work.Beginning to write long before the graphic artshad coined the term “minimalist,” wasan early minimalist in his writing. He learned partof the minimalist lesson during his years as a news-paper reporter. He learned, also, during that pe-riod the importance of close, accurate observation.As anyone who has studied journalism knows, jour-nalistic writing is direct, unencumbered, and ac-cessible. Journalists write short sentences that theyincorporate into short paragraphs. Their vocabu-lary is simple, their syntax not obscure.During his apprenticeship as a writer, Heming-way was a journalist—but not merely a journalist.He was a journalist living in post-World War I Paris,certainly the preferred gathering place of avant-garde artists and intellectuals of that age. Besidesliving  at  the  geographical  center  of  European—and therefore, worldwide—intellectual and artisticferment,  was a part of an inner circleof challenging artists.Ezra  Pound,  newly  emerged  from  his  Imagistand vorticist stages in poetry, was working on hisCantos,  which  he  began  to  publish  in  1930  andpublished periodically for the following ten years.Pound was also encouraging and guiding the youngT. S. Eliot, who dwelt just across the English Chan-nel in London, as he wroteThe Waste Land(1922),the poem that came to define modernism in po-etry. Ford Madox Ford was turning his efforts to re-cording in novels and short stories much of whathe had experienced in the war. Sherwood Ander-son,  goaded  by  Gertrude  Stein,  was  discoveringmetaphors for the whole of human existence in hisclose  examination  of  lives  of  the  people  whosehouses  fronted  on  the  main  street  of  his  nativeWinesburg, Ohio.Around Stein grew a circle of artists bent on re-defining art as it was then known. Pablo Picassohad passed from expressionism to impressionismand was emerging as a cubist, accomplishing withpaint  what  others  would  come  to  work  towardachieving with words. Henri Matisse was rediscov-ering color and using it in ways and in forms thatalarmed the public and set an aesthetic revolutiongoing in the minds of artists. Fortunately for Hem-ingway, he soon became a favored guest at 27 ruedes Fleures, where the redoubtable Stein lived withAlice B. Toklas, her companion, who talked withthe wives while Stein picked the brains of their cre-ative husbands. Such was the intellectual milieu inwhich found  himself  as  a  youth  notquite twenty-five. He was a reporter, and the pres-sure of that job assured his fluency in writing. Thewriting he did on his own was less voluminous thanthe writing he was paid to do. set for himself the task of writingabout a thousand words a day, or about three typedpages. He did not consider his work done, however,until he had revised that thousand words down toabout  three  hundred.  His  sentences  were  short.His words were simple. His constructions were un-complicated, his prose electrified. He assured him-self of its electricity by reading what he wrote eachday to his wife. When she got goose bumps fromwhat he read her, he knew that he was on target. was a consciously masculine writer.His  protagonists,  with  the  possible  exception  ofJake  Barnes  inThe  Sun  Also  Rises,  were  men  en-gaged  in  extreme  external  conflicts.  The  formsthese took included the solitary conflict of Santi-ago inThe Old Man and the Seaas he tried to beachhis fish after a three-day struggle; that of the bull-fighter inDeath in the Afternoon; the adventurers inThe Green Hills of Africa; his autobiographical char-acter, Frederic Henry, inA Farewell to Arms; or Rob-ert Jordan, who fought along with the Spanish loy-alists inFor Whom the Bell Tolls.In nearly everything he wrote, depicted courage as he defined the word: grace un-der pressure. He was fearful lest he not be consid-ered  courageous  himself, and  he  rankled  whenWilliam Faulkner, who was awarded the Nobel Prizein Literature four years before receivedit in 1954, was quoted in an interview as suggestingthat was lacking in courage—an astuteobservation on Faulkner’s part. learned much about literary style,especially about depicting human speech authenti-cally,  from  Stein.  He,  in  turn,  became  a  stylisticmodel for such modern writers as James Jones, Nel-son Algren, and Norman Mailer. Perhaps no othertwentieth century American author has been thespiritual progenitor to as many notable literary off-spring.Whereas Faulkner examined his native Missis-sippi  microscopically  in  his  work,  In so far as the collection of information is concerned, the advantages of travel may often be over-stated. So much has been written, so many facts are upon record about every country, even the most remote, that a judicious and persevering study of existing materials would no doubt enable a reader to fill himself with knowledge almost to repletion without leaving his chair. But for the formation of opinion, for the stirring and enlivenment of thought, and for the discernment of colour and proportion, the gifts of travel, especially of travel on foot, are priceless. It was with the design and in the hope of securing such prizes, that I undertook last year the pilgrimage of which these pages give account. I cannot tell whether I have succeeded in winning them; and still less whether, if won, they are transferable. I therefore view these letters with amodest eye. They were written mainly in long hot Uganda afternoons, after the day's march was done. The larger portion has already appeared in the _Strand Magazine_, and what has been added was necessary to complete the story. They present a continuous narrative of the lighter side of what was to me a very delightful and inspiring journey; and it is in the hope that they may vivify and fortify the interest of the British people in the wonderful estates they have recently acquired in the northeastern quarter of Africa, that I offer them in a connected form to the indulgence of the public. 1070bolted  from  the  environment  in  which  he  hadgrown  up.  His  major  work  explores  foreign  cul-tures in one way or another. If his cast of charac-ters is American, as it often is, these characters liveout their roles in foreign, usually hostile, environ-ments. Moving people away from all that is most fa-miliar to them heightens the pressure under whichthey  must  perform,  and  that  is  clearly  a  part  of’s technique. Even Santiago inThe OldMan and the Sea, although he is adrift in his fishingskiff in the waters off his native land, finds himselfalone in a huge, hostile environment.The Old Man and the Seais, however, differentfrom most of the others. In it, is moremellow than in any of his earlier work. He is stilltough, but the old man survives, and although thesharks that close in on his boat strip the flesh fromhis prized catch, he has the satisfaction of havingprevailed in the struggle. It is this book that tippedthe balance in favor of ’s winning theNobel Prize. His earlier work had not been affir-mative enough to reflect the Nobel Foundation’sguidelines.The  Old  Man  and  the  Sea,  although  itdoes not retreat from ’s basic themes,ends on a note of subdued triumph.Those who have but an indifferent banquet to offer, are not usually inclined to discourage their guests, by a repulsive bill of fare; yet surely, when a public invitation is given, there is honesty, and prudence too, in simply stating the kind of regale we are going to spread, lest a palled and sickly appetite should expect stimulants, or a perverted taste should pine for foreign luxuries and modern cookery, when we have nothing to set before them but plain old English food. Church and King now look as obsolete in a publication, as beef and pudding would at a gala dinner; yet let us remember, that as the latter have fed our heroes from the days of Cressy and Agincourt to the present times, so the former have fashioned minds fit to animate these mighty bodies. It is only to those who have a relish for stern virtue and gravereflection, that I would recommend the following pages.I have dated this narrative in a peculiarly calamitous period, though well aware that virtue, like happiness, is supposed to flourish most in times of tranquility. Such times afford no subjects for the historian o the bard; and even the moralist is often led to revert rather to those stormy eras which roused the energies of the human soul, and compelled it to assert qualities of which they who have observed only the repose of domestic life can form no conception. Man, attempting with finite powers to compass the most stupendous designs in spite of physical or moral obstacles; submitting to every privation, braving danger and death, often even defying omnipotence, and all for the sake of some speculative tenet, some doubtful advantage, the post of honour burdened by superlative responsibility, or the eminence of power attended with perpetual care, is an object no less interesting to the philosopher, than it is miraculous to the peasant, who places enjoyment in ease and animal indulgence. It is on the motives and actions which characterise this self-denial and enterprise, that the hero and the statesman fix their attention; forming their models, and drawing their conclusions, not from the passive inclinations, but from the capabilities of our species, not from what man would or ought to prefer, but from what he has achieved when stimulated by hope, goaded by ambition, or instigated by desperation.I do not prejudge the choice of these two routes. Both are now being carefully surveyed. The advantages of the longer and more ambitious line across Toro are perhaps superior. But the cost is also nearly twice as great; and cost is a vital factor--not merely to the government called upon to find money, but still more to the commercial soundness of an enterprise which is permanently crippled, if its original capital charges are allowed notably to exceed what the estimated earnings would sustain. The question is one which will require severe and patient examination, the nicest balancings between competitive advantages, the smoothest compromises between the practical and the ideal. I am endeavouring to guide the reader to a positive proposal of a modest and practical character, I mean the construction of a new railway which might be called 'The Victoria and Albert Railway,' although it would virtually be an extension of the existing Uganda line. Then, perhaps it will be time to make another journey; but as the reader, who will no doubt take care to secure a first-class tourist ticket, will no longer require my services as guide, I shall take this opportunity of making him my bow.
INFP	I DECIDE TO PLAY HOOKEYA steak-and-kidney pie, influenza, and a cablegram. There is thetriple alliance that is responsible for the whole thing. Though theremight have been a bit of homesickness and a desire for applause mixedup in the cycle of circumstances that started me off to Europe for avacation.For seven years I had been basking in California's perpetual sunlight,a sunlight artificially enhanced by the studio Cooper-Hewitts. Forseven years I had been working and thinking along in a single channeland I wanted to get away. Away from Hollywood, the cinema colony, awayfrom scenarios, away from the celluloid smell of the studios, awayfrom contracts, press notices, cutting rooms, crowds, bathingbeauties, custard pies, big shoes, and little moustaches. I was in theatmosphere of achievement, but an achievement which, to me, wasrapidly verging on stagnation.I wanted an emotional holiday. Perhaps I am projecting at the start adifficult condition for conception, but I assure you that even theclown has his rational moments and I needed a few.The triple alliance listed above came about rather simultaneously. Ihad finished the picture of 'The Kid' and 'The Idle Class' and wasabout to embark on another. The company had been engaged. Script andsettings were ready. We had worked on the picture one day.I was feeling very tired, weak, and depressed. I had just recoveredfrom an attack of influenza. I was in one of those 'what's the use'moods. I wanted something and didn't know what it was.And then Montague Glass invited me to dinner at his home in Pasadena.There were many other invitations, but this one carried with it theassurance that there would be a steak-and-kidney pie. A weakness ofmine. I was on hand ahead of time. The pie was a symphony. So was theevening. Monty Glass, his charming wife, their little daughter, LuciusHitchcock, the illustrator, and his wife--just a homey little familyparty devoid of red lights and jazz orchestras. It awoke within me achord of something reminiscent. I couldn't quite tell what.After the final onslaught on the pie, into the parlour before an openfire. Conversation, not studio patois nor idle chatter. An exchange ofideas--ideas founded on ideas. I discovered that Montague Glass wasmuch more than the author of _Potash and Perlmutter_. He thought. Hewas an accomplished musician.He played the piano. I sang. Not as an exponent of entertainment, butas part of the group having a pleasant, homey evening. We playedcharades. The evening was over too soon. It left me wishing. Here washome in its true sense. Here was a man artistically and commerciallysuccessful who still managed to lock the doors and put out the cat atnight.I drove back to Los Angeles. I was restless. There was a cablegramwaiting for me from London. It called attention to the fact that mylatest picture, 'The Kid,' was about to make its appearance in London,and, as it had been acclaimed my best, this was the time for me tomake the trip back to my native land. A trip that I had been promisingmyself for years.What would Europe look like after the war?I thought it over. I had never been present at the first showing ofone of my pictures. Their debut to me had been in Los Angelesprojection rooms. I had been missing something vital and stimulating.I had success, but it was stored away somewhere. I had never openedthe package and tasted it. I sort of wanted to be patted on the back.And I rather relished the pats coming in and from England. They hadhinted that I could, so I wanted to turn London upside down. Whowouldn't want to do that? And all the time there was the spectre ofnervous breakdown from overwork threatening and the results ofinfluenza apparent, to say nothing of the steak-and-kidney pie.Sensation of the pleasantest sort beckoned me, at the same time restwas promised. I wanted to grab it while it was good. Perhaps 'The Kid'might be my last picture. Maybe there would never be another chancefor me to bask in the spotlight. And I wanted to see Europe--England,France, Germany, and Russia. Europe was new.It was too much. I stopped preparations on the picture we were taking.Decided to leave the next night for Europe. And did it despite theprotests and the impossibility howlers. Tickets were taken. We packed;everyone was shocked. I was glad of it. I wanted to shock everyone.The next night I believe that most of Hollywood was at the train inLos Angeles to see me off. And so were their sisters and their cousinsand their aunts. Why was I going? A secret mission, I told them. Itwas an effective answer. I was immediately under contract to dopictures in Europe in the minds of most of them. But then, would theyhave believed or understood if I had told them I wanted an emotionalholiday? I don't believe so.There was the usual station demonstration at the train. The crowdrather surprised me. It was but a foretaste. I do not try to rememberthe shouted messages of cheer that were flung at me. They were of theusual sort, I imagine. One, however, sticks. My brother Syd at thelast moment rushed up to one of my party.'For God's sake, don't let him get married!' he shouted.It gave the crowd a laugh and me a scare.The train pulled out and I settled down to three days of relaxationand train routine. I ate sometimes in the dining car, sometimes in ourdrawing-room. I slept atrociously. I always do. I hate travelling. Thefaces left on the platform at Los Angeles began to look kinder andmore attractive. They did not seem the sort to drive one away. Butthey had, or maybe it was optical illusion on my part, illusionfostered by mental unrest.For two thousand miles we did the same thing over many times, thenrepeated it. Perhaps there were many interesting people on the train.I did not find out. The percentage of interesting ones on trains istoo small to hazard. Most of the time we played solitaire. You canplay it many times in two thousand miles.Then we reached Chicago. I like Chicago, I have never been there forany great length of time, but my glimpses of it have disclosedtremendous activity. Its record speaks achievement.But to me, personally, Chicago suggested Carl Sandburg, whose poetry Iappreciate highly and whom I had met in Los Angeles. I must see dearold Carl and also call at the office of the _Daily News_. They wererunning an enormous scenario contest. I am one of the judges, and ithappens that Carl Sandburg is on the same paper.Our party went to the Blackstone Hotel, where a suite had been placedat our disposal. The hotel management overwhelmed us with courtesies.Then came the reporters. You can't describe them unless you label themwith the hackneyed interrogation point.'Mr. Chaplin, why are you going to Europe?''Just for a vacation.''Are you going to make pictures while you are there?''No.''What do you do with your old moustaches?''Throw them away.''What do you do with your old canes?''Throw them away.''What do you do with your old shoes?''Throw them away.'That lad did well. He got in all those questions before he wasshouldered aside and two black eyes boring through lenses surroundedby tortoise-shell frames claimed an innings. I restored the 'propgrin' which I had decided was effective for interviews.'Mr. Chaplin, have you your cane and shoes with you?''No.''Why not?''I don't think I'll need them.''Are you going to get married while you are in Europe?''No.'  [Illustration: THE CALIFORNIAN SEA LION   THE ORIGIN OF THE FAMOUS BOOTS REVEALED AT LAST.   (_One of my favourite cartoons._)]The bespectacled one passed with the tide. As he passed I letthe grin slip away, but only for a moment. Hastily I recalled it as acharming young lady caught me by the arm.'Mr. Chaplin, do you ever expect to get married?''Yes.''To whom?''I don't know.''Do you want to play 'Hamlet'?''Why, I don't know. I haven't thought much about it, but if you thinkthere are any reasons why----'But she was gone. Another district attorney had the floor.'Mr. Chaplin, are you a Bolshevik?''No.''Then why are you going to Europe?''For a holiday.''What holiday?''Pardon me, folks, but I did not sleep well on the train and I must goto bed.'Like a football player picking a hole in the line, I had seen thebedroom door open and a friendly hand beckon. I made for it. Within Ihad every opportunity to anticipate the terror that awaited me on myholiday. Not the crowds. I love them. They are friendly andinstantaneous. But interviewers! Then we went to the _News_ office,and the trip was accomplished without casualty. There we metphotographers. I didn't relish facing them. I hate still pictures.But it had to be done. I was the judge in the contest and they musthave pictures of the judge.Now I had always pictured a judge as being a rather dignifiedpersonage, but I learned about judges from them. Their idea of the wayto photograph a judge was to have him standing on his head or with oneleg pointing east. They suggested a moustache, a Derby hat, and acane.It was inevitable.I couldn't get away from Chaplin.And I did so want a holiday.But I met Carl Sandburg. There was an oasis amid the misery. Good oldCarl! We recalled the days in Los Angeles. It was a most pleasantchat.Back to the hotel.Reporters. More reporters. Lady reporters.A publicity barrage.'Mr. Chaplin--'But I escaped. What a handy bedroom! There must be something inpractice. I felt that I negotiated it much better on the secondattempt. I rather wanted to try out my theory to see if I had becomean adept in dodging into the bedroom. I would try it. I went out tobrave the reporters. But they were gone. And when I ducked back intothe bedroom, as a sort of rehearsal, it fell flat. The effect was lostwithout the cause.A bit of food, some packing, and then to the train again. This timefor New York. Crowds again. I liked them. Cameras. I did not mindthem this time, as I was not asked to pose.Carl was there to see me off.I must do or say something extra nice to him. Something he couldappreciate. I couldn't think. I talked inanities and I felt that heknew I was being inane. I tried to think of a passage of his poetry torecite. I couldn't. Then it came--the inspiration.'Where can I buy your book of poems, Carl?' I almost blurted it out.It was gone. Too late to be recalled.'At any bookstore.'His reply may have been casual. To me it was damning.Ye gods, what a silly imbecile I was! I needed rest. My brain wasgone. I couldn't think of a thing to say in reprieve. Thank God, thetrain pulled out then. I hope Carl will understand and forgive when hereads this, if he ever does.A wretched sleep _en train_, more solitaire, meals at schedule times,and then we hit New York.Crowds. Reporters. Photographers. And Douglas Fairbanks. Good oldDoug. He did his best, but Doug has never had a picture yet where hehad to buck news photographers. They snapped me in every postureanatomically possible. Two of them battled with my carcass in argumentover my facing east or west.Neither won. But I lost. My body couldn't be split. But my clothescould--and were.But Doug put in a good lick and got me into an automobile. Panting, Ilay back against the cushions.To the Ritz went Doug and 
INFP	To the Ritz went the crowd.Or at least I thought so, for there was a crowd there and it lookedlike the same one. I almost imagined I saw familiar faces. Certainly Isaw cameras. But this time our charge was most successful. With aguard of porters as shock troops, we negotiated the distance betweenthe curb and the lobby without the loss of a single button.I felt rather smart and relieved. But, as usual, I was too previous.We ascended to the suite. There they were. The gentlemen of the press.And one lady of the press.'Mr. Chaplin, why are you going to Europe?''For a vacation.''What do you do with your old moustaches?''Throw them away.''Do you ever expect to get married?''Yes.''What's her name?''I don't know.''Are you a Bolshevik?''I am an artist. I am interested in life. Bolshevism is a new phase oflife. I must be interested in it.''Do you want to play 'Hamlet'?''Why, I don't know--'Again Lady Luck flew to my side. I was called to the telephone. Ianswered the one in my bedroom, and closed the door, and kept itclosed. The Press departed. I felt like a wrung dish-rag. I lookedinto the mirror. I saw a Cheshire cat grinning back at me. I was stillcarrying the 'prop' grin that I had invented for interviews. Iwondered if it would be easier to hold it all the time rather thanchase it into play at the sight of reporters. But some one mightaccuse me of imitating Doug. So I let the old face slip back tonormal.Doug came. Mary was better. She was with him. It was good to see her.The three of us went to the roof to be photographed. We were, in everyconceivable pose until some one suggested that Doug should hang overthe edge of the roof, holding Mary in one hand and me in the other.Pretty little thought. But that's as far as it got. I beat Doug to therefusal by a hair.It's great to have friends like Doug and Mary. They understood meperfectly. They knew what the seven years' grind had meant to mynerves. They knew just how badly I needed this vacation, how I neededto get away from studios and pictures, how I needed to get away frommyself.Doug had thought it all out and had planned that while I was in NewYork my vacation should be perfect. He would see that things were keptpleasant for me.So he insisted that I should go and see his new picture, 'The ThreeMusketeers.'I was nettled. I didn't want to see pictures. But I was polite. I didnot refuse, though I did try to evade.It was useless. Very seriously he wanted me to see the picture andgive my honest opinion. He wanted my criticism, my suggestions.I had to do it. I always do. I saw the picture in jerks.Reporters were there. Their attendance was no secret.The picture over, I suggested a few changes and several cuts which Ithought would improve it.I always do.They listened politely and then let the picture ride the way it was.They always do.Fortunately, the changes I suggested were not made, and the picture isa tremendous success.But I still have status as a critic. I am invited to a showing ofMary's picture, 'Little Lord Fauntleroy,' and asked for suggestions.They know that I'll criticise. I always do and they are afraid of me.Though when they look at my pictures they are always kind andsympathetic and never criticise.I told Mary her picture was too long. I told her where to cut it.Which, of course, she doesn't do. She never does.She and Doug listen politely and the picture stands. It always does.Newspaper men are at the hotel. I go through the same barrage ofquestions. My 'prop' grin does duty for fifteen minutes. I escape.Douglas 'phones me. He wants to be nice to me. I am on my vacation andhe wants it to be a very pleasant one. So he invites me to see 'TheThree Musketeers' again. This time at its first showing before thepublic.Before the opening of Doug's picture we were to have dinner together,Mary and Doug, Mrs. Conde Nast and 
INFP	I felt very embarrassed at meeting Mrs. Nast again. Somewhere therelurks in my memory a broken dinner engagement. It worried me, as I hadnot even written. It was so foolish not to write. I would be metprobably with an 'all-is-forgiven' look.I decide that my best defence is to act vague and not speak of it. Ido so and get away with it.And she has the good taste not to mention it, so a pleasant time ishad by all.We went to the theatre in Mrs. Nast's beautiful limousine. The crowdswere gathered for several blocks on every side of the theatre.I felt proud that I was in the movies. Though on this night, withDouglas and Mary, I felt that I was trailing in their glory. It wastheir night.There are cheers--for Mary, for Doug, for me. Again I feel proud thatI am in the movies. I try to look dignified. I coax up the 'prop'smile and put into it real pleasure. It is a real smile. It feels goodand natural.We get out of the car and crowds swarm. Most of the 'all-American'selections are there. Doug takes Mary under his wing and ploughsthrough as though he were doing a scene and the crowd were extras.I took my cue from him. I took Mrs. Nast's arm. At least I tried totake it, but she seemed to sort of drift away from me down towardsEighth Avenue, while I, for no apparent reason, backed towardBroadway. The tide changed. I was swept back toward the entrance ofthe theatre. I was not feeling so proud as I had been. I was stillsmiling at the dear public, but it had gone back to the 'prop' smile.I realised this and tried to put real pleasure into the smile again.As the grin broadened it opened new space and a policeman parked hisfist in it.I don't like the taste of policemen's fists. I told him so. He glaredat me and pushed me for a 'first down.' My hat flew toward theheavens. It has never returned to me.I felt a draught. I heard machinery. I looked down. A woman with apair of scissors was snipping a piece from the seat of my trousers.Another grabbed my tie and almost put an end to my suffering throughstrangulation. My collar was next. But they only got half of that.My shirt was pulled out. The buttons torn from my vest. My feettrampled on. My face scratched. But I still retained the smile, 'prop'one though it was. Whenever I could think of it I tried to raise itabove the level of a 'prop' smile and was always rewarded with apoliceman's fist. I kept insisting that I was Charlie Chaplin and thatI belonged inside. It was absolutely necessary that I should see 'TheThree Musketeers.'Insistence won. As though on a prearranged signal I felt myself liftedfrom my feet, my body inverted until my head pointed toward the centreof the lobby and my feet pointed toward an electric sign advertisingthe Ziegfeld Roof. Then there was a surge, and I moved forward rightover the heads of the crowd through the lobby.As I went through the door, not knowing into what, I saw a friend.With the 'prop' smile still waving, I flung back, 'See you later,'and, head first, I entered the theatre and came to in a heap at thefoot of a bediamonded dowager. I looked up, still carrying the 'prop'smile, but my effort fell flat. There was no applause in the look shegave me.Crestfallen, I gathered myself together, and with what dignity therewas left I strode to the box that had been set aside for our party.There was Mary, as sweet and beautiful as ever; Mrs. Nast, calm andcomposed: Doug serene and dapper.'Late again,' they looked.And Mary, steely polite, enumerated my sartorial shortcomings. But Iknew one of them, at least better than she did, and I hastened to themen's room for repairs. Soap and water and a brush did wonders, but Icould find no trousers, collar, or tie, and I returned clean butragged to the box, where disapproval was being registered unanimously.I tried to make the 'prop' grin more radiant, even though I was mosttired after my journey, but it didn't go with Doug and Mary.But I refused to let them spoil my pleasure and I saw 'The ThreeMusketeers.'It was a thrilling success for Doug. I felt good for him, though I wasa bit envious. I wondered if the showing of 'The Kid' could have meantas big a night for me.'Twas quite a night, this opening of the Fairbanks masterpiece, and,considering all the circumstances, I think I behaved admirably.Somehow, though, I think there is a vote of three to one against me.I
INFP	OFF TO EUROPENext morning there was work to do. My lawyer, Nathan Burkan, had to beseen. There were contracts and other things. Almost as much a nuisanceas interviews. But I dare say they are necessary.Poor old Nath! I love him, but am afraid of him. His pockets alwaysbulge contracts. We could be such good friends if he were not alawyer. And I am sure that there must be times when he is delightfulcompany. I might fire him and then get acquainted.A very dull day with him. Interrupted by 'phones, invitations,parties, theatre tickets sent to me, people asking for jobs. Hundredsof letters camouflaged with good wishes and invariably asking favours.But I like them.Calls from many old friends who depress me and many new ones whothrill me. I wanted some buckwheat cakes. I had to go three blocks toa Childs' restaurant to get them.That night I went to see 'Liliom,' the best play in New York at thetime and one which in moments rises to true greatness. It impressed metremendously and made me dissatisfied with myself. I don't like beingwithout work. I want to go on the stage. Wonder if I could play thatpart?I went back behind the scenes and met young Skildkraut. I was amazedat his beauty and youth. Truly an artist, sincere and simple. And EvaLe Gallienne, I recall no one else on the stage just like her. She isa charming artist. We renewed our acquaintance made in Los Angeles.The next morning provided a delightful treat. Breakfast for me,luncheon for the others, at the Coffee House Club, a most interestinglittle place where artists and artizans belong--writers, actors,musicians, sculptors, painters--all of them interesting people. I gothere often whenever I am in New York. It was a brilliant party,Heywood Broun, Frank Crowninshield, Harrison Rhodes, Edward Knoblock,Conde Nast, Alexander Woolcott--but I can't remember all the names. Iwish all meals were as pleasant.I received an invitation to dine with Ambassador Gerard and then gofor a ride in the country. The motor broke down, as they usually do onsuch occasions, and I had to 'phone and disappoint. I was sorry,because I was to meet some brilliant people.I had luncheon next day with Max Eastman, one of my best friends. Heis a radical and a poet and editor of _The Liberator_, a charming andsympathetic fellow who thinks. All of his doctrines I do not subscribeto, but that makes no difference in our friendship. We get together,argue a bit, and then agree to disagree and let it go at that andremain friends.He told me of a party that he was giving at his home that evening andI hastened to accept his invitation to attend. His home is alwaysinteresting. His friends likewise.What a night it was for me! I got out of myself. My emotions went thegamut of tears to laughter without artificiality. It was what I hadleft Los Angeles for, and that night Charlie Chaplin seemed very faraway, and I felt or wanted to feel myself just a simple soul amongother souls.I was introduced to George, an ex-
INFP	 W. W. secretary. I suppose he hasa last name, but I didn't know it and it didn't seem to matter whenone met George. Here was a real personality. He had a light in hiseyes that I have never seen before, a light that must have shone fromhis soul. He had the look of one who believes he is right and has thecourage of his convictions. It is a scarce article.I learned that he had been sentenced by Judge Landis to serve twentyyear in the penitentiary, that he had served two years and was outbecause of ill-health. I did not learn the offence. It did not seem tomatter.A dreamer and a poet, he became wistfully gay on this hectic nightamong kindred spirits. In a mixed crowd of intellectuals he stood out.He was going back to serve his eighteen years in the penitentiary andwas remaining jovial. What an ordeal! But ordeal signifies what itwould have been for me. I don't believe it bothered him. I hardlybelieve he was there. He was somewhere else in the place from whichthat look in his eyes emanated. A man whose ideas are ideals.I pass no opinion, but with such charm one must sympathise.It was an amusing evening. We played charades and I watched Georgeact. It was all sorts of fun. We danced a bit.Then George came in imitating Woodrow. It was screamingly funny, andhe threw himself into the character, or caricature, making Wilson seemabsurdly ridiculous. We were convulsed with laughter.But all the time I couldn't help thinking that he must go back to thepenitentiary for eighteen years.What a party!It didn't break up until two in the morning, though clock or calendardidn't get a thought from me.We all played, danced, and acted. No one asked me to walk funny, noone asked me to twirl a cane. If I wanted to do a tragic bit, I did,and so did everyone else. You were a creature of the present, not aproduction of the past, not a promise of the future. You were acceptedas is, _sans_ 'Who's Who' labels and income-tax records.George asks me about my trip, but he does not interview. He gives meletters to friends.In my puny way, sounding hollow and unconvincing, I try to tell Georgehow foolish he is. He tries to explain that he can't help it. Like alltrail blazers, he is a martyr. He does not rant. He blames no one. Hedoes not rail at fate.If he believes himself persecuted, his belief is unspoken. He isalmost Christlike as he explains to me. His viewpoint is beautiful,kind, and tender.I can't imagine what he has done to be sentenced to twenty years. Mythought must speak. He believes he is spoiling my party through makingme serious. He doesn't want that.He stops talking about himself. Suddenly he runs, grabs a woman's hat,and says, 'Look, Charlie, I'm Sarah Bernhardt!' and goes into a mostridiculous travesty.I laugh. Everyone laughs. George laughs.And he is going back to the penitentiary to spend eighteen of the mostwonderful years of his life!I can't stand it. I go out in the garden and gaze up at the stars. Itis a wonderful night and a glorious moon is shining down. I wish therewas something I could do for George. I wonder if he is right or wrong.Before long George joins me. He is sad and reflective, with a sadnessof beauty, not of regret. He looks at the moon, the stars. Heconfides, how stupid is the party, any party, compared with theloveliness of the night. The silence that is a universal gift--how fewof us enjoy it. Perhaps because it cannot be bought. Rich men buynoise. Souls revel in nature's silences. They cannot be denied thosewho seek them.We talk of George's future. Not of his past nor of his offence. Can'the escape? I try to make him think logically toward regaining hisfreedom. I want to pledge my help. He doesn't understand, or pretendsnot to. He has not lost anything. Bars cannot imprison his spirit.I beg him to give himself and his life a better chance.He smiles.'Don't bother about me, Charlie. You have your work. Go on making theworld laugh. Yours is a great task and a splendid one. Don't botherabout me.'We are silent. I am choked up. I feel a sort of pent-up helplessness.I want relief. It comes.The tears roll down my cheeks and George embraces me.There are tears in both our eyes.'Good-bye, Charlie.''Good-bye, George.'What a party! Its noise disgusts me now. I call my car. I go back tothe Ritz.George goes back to the 'pen.'Chuck Reisner, who played the big bully in 'The Kid,' called the nextday. He wants to go to Europe. Why? He doesn't know. He is emotionaland sensational. He is a pugilist and a song writer. A civil soldierof fortune. He doesn't like New York and thinks he wants to get backto California at once.We have breakfast together. It is a delightful meal because it is sodifferent from my usual lonely breakfast. Chuck goes on at a greatrate and succeeds in working up his own emotions until there are tearsin his eyes.I promise him all sorts of things to get rid of him. He knows it andtells me so. We understand each other very well. I promise him anengagement. Tell him he can always get a job with me if he doesn'twant too much money.He is indignant at some press notices that have appeared about me andwants to go down to newspaper row and kill a few reporters. Hefathers, mothers me in his rough way.We talk about everybody's ingratitude for what he and I have done forpeople. We have a mutual-admiration convention. Why aren't weappreciated more? We are both sour on the world and its hypocrisies.It's a great little game panning the world so long as you don't letyour sessions get too long or too serious.I had a luncheon engagement at the Coffee House Club with FrankCrowninshield, and we talked over the arrangements of a dinner which Iam giving to a few intimate friends. Frank is my social mentor, thoughI care little about society in the general acceptance of the term. Wearranged for a table at the Elysee Cafe and it was to be a mixedparty.Among the guests were Max Eastman, Harrison Rhodes, Edward Knoblock,Mme. Maeterlinck, Alexander Woolcott, Douglas Fairbanks and Mary,Heywood Broun, Rita Weiman, and Neysa McMein, a most charming girl forwhom I am posing.Frank Harris and Waldo Frank were invited, but were unable to attend.Perhaps there were others, but I can't remember, and I am sure theywill forgive me if I have neglected to mention them. I am alwaysconfused about parties and arrangements.The last minute sets me wild. I am a very bad organiser. I am alwaysleaving everything until the last minute, and as a rule no one showsup.This was the exception. For on this occasion everybody did turn up.And it started off like most parties; everybody was stiff and formal;I felt a terrible failure as a host. But in spite of Mr. Volsteadthere was a bit of 'golden water' to be had, and it saved the day.What a blessing at times!I had been worried since sending the invitations. I wondered how MaxEastman would mix with the others, but I was soon put at my ease,because Max is clever and is just as desirous of having a good time asanyone, in spite of intellectual differences. That night he seemed thenecessary ingredient to make the party.The fizz water must have something of the sort of thing that old Poncede Leon sought. Certainly it made us feel very young. Back tochildren we leaped for the night. There were games, music, dancing.And no wallflowers. Everyone participated.We began playing charades, and Doug and Mary showed us some cleveracting. They both got on top of a table and made believe he was theconductor of a trolley car and she was a passenger. After an orgy ofcalling out stations _en route_ the conductor came along to thepassenger and collected her fare. Then they both began dancing aroundthe floor, explaining that they were a couple of fairies dancing alongthe side of a brook, picking flowers. Soon Mary fell in and Douglasplunged in after her and pulled her up on the banks of the brook.That was their problem, and, guess though we would, we could not solveit.They gave the answer finally. It was 'Fairbanks.'Then we sang, and in Italian--at least it passed for that. I actedwith Mme. Maeterlinck. We played a burlesque on the great dying sceneof 'Camille.' But we gave it a touch that Dumas overlooked.When she coughed, I got the disease immediately, and was soon takenwith convulsions and died instead of Camille.We sang some more, we danced, we got up and made impromptu speeches onany given subject. None were about the party, but on subjects like'political economy,' 'the fur trade,' 'feminism.'Each one would try to talk intelligently and seriously on a givensubject for one minute. My subject was the 'fur trade.'I prefaced my talk by references to cats, rabbits, etc., and finishedup by diagnosing the political situation in Russia.For me the party was a great success. I succeeded in forgetting myselffor a while. I hope the rest of them managed to do the same thing.From the cafe the party went over to a little girl's house--she was afriend of Mr. Woolcott--and again we burst forth in music and dancing.We made a complete evening of it and I went to bed tired and exhaustedabout five in the morning.I want a long sleep, but am awakened by my lawyer at nine. He haspackages of legal documents and papers for me to sign, my orders aboutcertain personal things of great importance. I have a splittingheadache. My boat is sailing at noon, and altogether, with a lawyerfor a companion, it is a hideous day.All through the morning the telephone bell is ringing. Reporters. Ilisten several times, but it never varies.'Mr. Chaplin, why are you going to Europe?''To get rid of interviews,' I finally shout, and hang up the 'phone.Somehow, with invaluable assistance, we get away from the hotel andare on our way to the dock. My lawyer meets me there. He has come tosee me off. I tremble, though, for fear he has more business with me.I am criticised by my lawyer for talking so sharply the first thing inthe morning. That's just it. He always sees me the first thing in themorning. That's what makes me short.But it is too big a moment. Something is stirring within me. I amanxious and reluctant about leaving. My emotions are all mixed.It is a beautiful morning. New York looks much finer and nicer becauseI am leaving it. I am terribly troubled about passports and the usualprocedure about declaring income tax, but my lawyer reassures me thathe has fixed everything O.K. and that my name will work a lot ofinfluence with the American officials; but I am very dubious about itwhen I am met by the American officials at the port.I am terrified by American officials. I am extra nice to theofficials, and to my amazement they are extra nice to me. Everythingpasses off very easily.As usual, my lawyer was right. He had fixed everything. He is a goodlawyer.We could be such intimate friends if he wasn't.But I am too thrilled to give much time to pitying lawyers.I am going to Europe.The crowds of reporters, photographers, all sorts of traffic, pushing,shoving, opening passports, vises O.K.'d, stamped, in perfect, almostclocklike precision, I am shoved aboard.The newspaper battery pictorial and reportorial. There is no originalnote.'Mr. Chaplin, why are you going to Europe?'I feel that in this last moment I should be a bit more tolerant andpleasant, no matter how difficult. I bring forth the 'prop' smileagain.'For a vacation,' I answer.Then they go through the standard interview form and I try to beobliging.Mrs. John Carpenter is on the boat--was also invited to my party, butcouldn't attend--with her charming daughter, who has the face of anangel, also Mr. Edward Knoblock. We are all photographed. Doug andMary are there. Lots of people to see me off. Somehow I don't seeminterested in them very much. My mind is pretty well occupied. I amtrying to make conversation, but am more interested in the people andthe boat and those who are going to travel with me.Many of the passengers on the boat are bringing their children that Imay be introduced. I don't mind children.'I have seen you so many times in the pictures.'I find myself smiling at them graciously and pleasantly, especiallythe children.I doubt if I am really sincere in this, as it is too early in themorning. Despite the fact that I love children, I find them difficultto meet. I feel rather inferior to them. Most of them have assurance,have not yet been cursed with self-consciousness.And one has to be very much on his best behaviour with childrenbecause they detect our insincerity. I find there are quite a lot ofchildren on board.Everyone is so pleasant, especially those left behind. Handkerchiefsare waving. The boat is off. We start to move, the waters arechurning. Am feeling very sad, rather regretful--think what a nice manmy lawyer is.We turn around the bend and get into the channel. The crowds are butlittle flies now. In this fleeting dramatic moment there comes thefeeling of leaving something very dear behind.The camera man and many of his brothers are aboard. I discover him asI turn around. I did not want to discover anyone just then. I wantedto be alone with sky and water. But I am still Charlie Chaplin. I mustbe photographed--and am.We are passing the Statue of Liberty. He asks me to wave and throwkisses, which rather annoys me.The thing is too obvious. It offends my sense of sincerity.The Statue of Liberty is thrilling, dramatic, a glorious symbol. Iwould feel self-conscious and cheap in deliberately waving andthrowing kisses at it. I will be myself.I refuse.The incident of the photographic seeker before the Statue of Libertyupset me. I felt that he was trying to capitalise the statue. Hisrequest was deliberate, insincere. It offended me. It would have beenlike calling an audience to witness the placing of flowers upon agrave. Patriotism is too deep a feeling to depict in the posing for aphotograph. Why are attempts made to parade such emotions? I feel gladthat I have the courage to refuse.As I turn from the photographer I feel a sense of relief. I am to havea reprieve from such annoyances. Reporters for the while are leftbehind. It is a delicious sense of security.I am ready for the new adjustment. I am in a new world, a little cityof its own, where there are new people--people who may be eitherpleasant or unpleasant, and mine is the interesting job of placingthem in their proper category. I want to explore new lands and I feelthat I shall have ample opportunity on such an immense ship. The_Olympic_ is enormous and I conjure up all sorts of pleasure to be hadin its different rooms--Turkish baths, gymnasium, music rooms--itsRitz-Carlton restaurant, where everything is elaborate and of ornatesplendour. I find myself looking forward to my evening meal.We go to the Ritz grill to dine. Everyone is pleasant. I seem to sensethe feel of England immediately. Foreign food--a change of system--thedifferent bill of fare, with money in terms of pounds, shillings, andpence. And the dishes--pheasant, grouse, and wild duck. For the firsttime I feel the elegant gentleman, the man of means.I ask questions and discover that there are really some veryinteresting people aboard. But I resent anyone telling me about them.I want to discover them myself. I almost shout when someone tries toread me a passenger list. This is my desert island--I am going toexplore it myself. The prospect is intriguing. I am three thousandmiles from Hollywood and three thousand miles from Europe. For themoment I belong to neither.God be praised, I am myself.It is my little moment of happiness, the glorious 'to-day' that issandwiched in between the exhausting 'yesterday' of Los Angeles andthe portentous 'to-morrow' of Europe.For the moment I am content.II
INFP	DAYS ON SHIPBOARDI notice a thoughtful-looking, studious sort of man seated across fromus. He is reading a book, a different sort of book, if covers meananything. It looks formidable, a sort of intellectual fodder. I wonderwho he is. I weave all sorts of romance about him. I place him in allsorts of intellectual undertakings, though he may be a collegeprofessor. I would love to know him. I feel that he is interested inus. I mention it to Knoblock. He keeps looking at us. Knoblock tellsme he is Gillette, the safety-razor man. I feel like romancing abouthim more than ever. I wonder what he is reading? I would love to knowhim. It is our loss, I believe. And I never learned what the book wasthat he was reading.There are very few pretty girls aboard. I never have any luck thatway. And it is a weakness of mine. I feel that it would be awfullypleasant to cross the ocean with a number of nice girls who werepretty and who would take me as I am. We listened to the music andretired early, this because of a promise to myself that I would dolots of reading aboard. I have a copy of Max Eastman's poems, coloursof life, a volume of treasures. I try to read them, but am toonervous. The type passes in parade, but I assimilate nothing, so Iprepare to sleep and be in good shape for the morning. But that isalso impossible.I am beyond sleep to-night now. I am in something new, somethingpregnant with expectation. The immediate future is too alluring forsleep.How shall I be received in England? What sort of a trip shall I have?Whom shall I meet on board? The thoughts chased one another round mybrain and back again, all running into one another in their rambling.I get up at one o'clock. Decide to read again. This time H. G. Wells's_Outline of History_. Impossible! It doesn't register. I try to forceit by reading aloud. It can't be done. The tongue can't cheat thebrain, and right now reading is out of the question.I get up and go to see if Knoblock is in. He sleeps audibly andconvincingly. He is not making his debut.I go back to my room. I rather feel sorry for myself. If only theTurkish baths were open I could while a few hours of time away untilmorning. Thus I mediate. The last thing I remember it is four o'clockin the morning and the next thing eleven-thirty. I can hear a greatbit of excitement going on outside my cabin door. There are a lot oflittle children there with autograph books. I tell them that I willsign them later and have them leave the books with my secretary, TomHarrington.There is a composite squeal of pleasure at this and a sickening fearcomes over me. I call Tom. He enters amid a raft of autograph books. Istart to sign, then postpone it until after breakfast.Knoblock comes in all refreshed and with that radiant sort ofcheerfulness that I resent in the morning. Am I going to get up forlunch or will I have it in my cabin? There is a pleading lethargy thatsays, 'Take it in bed,' but I cannot overcome the desire to exploreand the feeling of expectancy of something about to happen--I was tosee somebody or meet somebody--so I decide to have luncheon in thedining-room. I am giving myself the emotional stimulus. Nothing comesoff. We meet nobody.After lunch a bit of exercise. We run around the deck for a couple ofmiles. It brings back thoughts of the days when I ran in Marathonraces. I feel rather self-conscious, however, as I am being pointedout by passengers. With each lap it gets worse. If there was only aplace where I could run with nobody looking. We finally stop and leanagainst the rail.All the stewards are curious. They are trying to pick me out. I noticeit and pretend not to notice it. I go up into the gymnasium and lookaround. There is every contrivance to give joy to healthy bodies. Andbest of all, nobody else is there. Wonderful!I try the weights, the rowing machine, the travelling rings, punch thebag a bit, swing some Indian clubs, and leap to the trapeze. Suddenlythe place is packed. News travels quickly aboard ship. Some come forthe purpose of exercising, like myself; others out of curiosity towatch me perform. I grow careless. I don't care to go through with it.I put on my coat and hat and go to my room, finding that the oldonce-discarded 'prop' smile is useful as I make my way through thecrowd.At four o'clock we have tea. I decide that the people are interesting.I love to meet so many. Perhaps they are the same ones I hated to seecome into the gym, but I feel no sense of being paradoxical. Thegymnasium belongs to individuals. The tea-room suggests and invitessocial intercourse. Somehow there are barriers and conventionalitiesthat one cannot break, for all the vaunted 'freedom of shipboard.' Ifeel it's a sort of awkward situation. How is it possible to meetpeople on the same footing? I hear of it, I read of it, but somehow Icannot meet people myself and stay myself.I immediately shift any blame from myself and decide that thefirst-class passengers are all snobs. I resolve to try thesecond-class or the third-class. Somehow I can't meet these people. Iget irritable and decide deliberately to seek the other classes ofpassengers and the boat crew.Another walk around the deck. The salt air makes me feel good inspite of my mental bothers. I look over the rail and see otherpassengers, second or third class, and in one large group the ship'sfiremen and stokers. They are the night force come on deck for abreath of air between working their shifts in the hellish heat below.They see and recognise me. To their coal-blackened faces come smiles.They shout 'Hooray!' 'Hello, Charlie!' Ah, I am discovered. But Itingle all over with pleasure. As those leathery faces crack intolines through the dust I sense sincerity. There is a friendly feeling.I warm to them.There is a game of cricket going on. That's intriguing. I lovecricket. Wish I could try my hand at it. Wish there was enoughspontaneity about first-cabin passengers to start a game. I wish Iwasn't so darn self-conscious. They must have read my thoughts. I aminvited timidly, then vociferously, to play a game. Their invitationcheers me. I feel one of them. A spirit of adventure beckons. I leapover the rail and right into the midst of it.I carry with me into the steerage just a bit ofself-consciousness--there are so many trying to play upon me. I amlooked upon as a celebrity, not a cricket player. But I do my part andtry and we get into the game. Suddenly a motion-picture camera manbobs up from somewhere. What leeches! He snaps a picture. This getssickening.One of the crew has hurriedly made himself up as 'Charlie Chaplin.' Hecauses great excitement. This also impresses me. I find myself actinga part, looking surprised and interested. I am conscious of the factthat this thing has been done many times before. Then on secondthought I realise it is all new to them and that they mean well, so Itry to enter into the spirit of the thing. There comes a pause in thecricket game. Nobody is very much interested in it.I find that I have been resurrected again in character and am thecentre of attraction. There are calls, 'What have you done with yourmoustache?' I look up with a grin and ready to answer anything theyask, these chaps who labour hard and must play the same way. But I seethat hundreds of first-class passengers are looking down over the railas though at a side show. This affects my pride, though I dare say Iam supersensitive. I have an idea that they think I am 'Charlie'performing for them. This irritates me. I throw up my hands and say,'See you to-morrow.'One of the bystanders presents himself. 'Charlie, don't you rememberme?' I have a vague recollection of his face, but cannot place him.Now I have it, of course; we worked in some show together. Yes, I canactually place him. He has a negative personality. I remember that heplayed a small part, a chorus man or something of the sort. Thisbrings back all sorts of reminiscences, some depressing and othersinteresting. I wonder what his life has been. I remember him now veryplainly. He was a bad actor, poor chap. I never knew him very welleven when we worked in the same company. And now he is stoking in thehold of a ship. I think I know what his emotions are and understandthe reasons. I wonder whether he understands mine.I try to be nice, even though I discover the incident is not overinteresting. But I try to make it so--try harder just because he nevermeant a great deal before. But now it seems to take on a greatersignificance, the meeting with this chap, and I find myself beingextra nice to him, or at least trying to be.Darn it all, the first-class passengers are looking on again, and Iwill not perform for them. They arouse pride, indignation. I havedecided to become very exclusive on board. That's the way to treatthem.It is five o'clock. I decide to take a Turkish bath. Ah, what adifference travelling first class after the experience in thesteerage!There is nothing like money. It does make life so easy. These thoughtscome easily in the luxury of a warm bath. I feel a little more kindlydisposed toward the first-cabin passengers. After all, I am anemotional cuss.Discover that there are some very nice people on board. I get intoconversation with two or three. They have the same ideas about lots ofthings that I have. This discovery gives me a fit of introspectionand I discover that I am, indeed, a narrow-minded little pinhead.What peculiar sights one sees in a Turkish bath. The two extremes, fatand thin, and so seldom a perfect physique. I am a discoveredman--even in my nakedness. One man will insist upon showing me how todo a hand balance in the hot room. Also a somersault and a back flip.It challenges my nimbleness. Can I do them? Good heavens--no! I'm notan acrobat, I'm an actor. I am indignant.Then he points out the value of regular exercise, outlining for mybenefit a daily course for me to do aboard. I don't want any dailycourse and I tell him so.'But,' says he, 'if you keep this up for a week you may be able to dothe stunts I do.'But I can't see it even with that prospect ahead, because to save mylife I can't think of any use I would have for the hand balance,somersault, or the back flip.I meet another man who has manoeuvred until he has me pinned in acorner. He shows a vital interest in Theda Bara. Do I know her? Whatsort of a person is she? Does she 'vamp' in real life? Do I knowLouise Glaum? He sort of runs to the vampish ladies. Do I know any ofthe old-timers? So his conversation goes depressingly on, with meanswering mostly in the negative.  [Illustration: A scene from 'Sunnyside,' one of my favourite photo   plays.]They must think I am very dull. Why, anyone should know the answers tothe questions they figure. There are grave doubts as to whetherI am Charlie Chaplin or not. I wish they would decide that I am not. Iconfess that I have never met Theda Bara. They return to motionpictures of my own. How do I think up my funny stunts? It is too much.Considerably against my wishes I have to retreat from the hot room. Iwant to get away from this terrible, strenuous experience. But retreatis not so easy.A little rotund individual, smiling, lets me know that he has seen anumber of my pictures. He says:'I have seen you so much in 'reel' life that I wanted to talk to youin 'real' life.' He laughs at this bright little sally of his and Idare say he thinks it original. The first time I heard it I choked onmy milk bottle.But I grinned. I always do. He asked what I was taking a Turkish bathfor, and I told him I was afraid of acquiring a bit of a stomach. Iwas speaking his language. He knew the last word in taking downstomachs. He went through all the stomach-reducing routine. He rolled,he slapped, he stretched across a couch on his stomach while hebreathed deeply and counted a hundred. He had several other stunts butI stopped him. He had given me enough ideas for a beginning. He got uppanting, and I noticed that the most prominent thing about him was hisstomach and that he had the largest stomach in the room. But headmitted that the exercise had fixed him O.K.Eventually he glanced down at my feet. 'Good heavens! I always thoughtyou had big feet. Have you got them insured?' I can stand it nolonger. I burst through the door into the cooling room and on to theslab.At last I am where I can relax. The masseur is an Englishman and hasseen most of my pictures. He talks about 'Shoulder Arms.' He mentionsthings in my pictures that I never remembered putting there. He hadalways thought I was a pretty muscular guy, but was sadlydisappointed.'How do you do your funny falls?' He is surprised that I am notcovered with bruises. 'Do I know Clara Kimball Young? Are most of thepeople in pictures immoral?'I make pretences. I am asleep. I am very tired. An audience hasdrifted in and I hear a remark about my feet.I am manhandled and punched and then handed on into another room.At last I can relax. I am about to fall asleep when one of thepassengers asks if I would mind signing my autograph for him. But Iconquer them. Patience wins and I fall asleep to be awakened at seveno'clock and told to get out of the bath.I dress for dinner. We go into the smoking-room. I meet the demoncamera man. I do not know him, as he is dressed up like a regularperson. We get into conversation. Well, hardly conversation. He talks.'Listen, Charlie, I am very sorry, but I've been assigned tophotograph you on this trip. Now we might as well get to know eachother and make it easy for both of us, so the best thing to do is tolet's do it fully and get it over with. Now, let's see, I'll taketo-morrow and part of the next day. I want to photograph you with thethird-class passengers, then the second-class, and have you shownplaying games on deck. If you have your make-up and your moustache,hat, shoes, and cane, it will be all the better.'I call for help. He will have to see my personal representative, Mr.Robinson.He says, 'I won't take 'No' for an answer.'And I let him know that the only thing he isn't going to do on thetrip is to photograph me. I explain that it would be a violation ofcontract with the First National exhibitors.'I have been assigned to photograph you and I'm going to photographyou,' he says. And then he told me of his other camera conquests, ofhis various experiences with politicians who did not want to bephotographed.'I had to break through the palace walls to photograph the King ofEngland, but I got him. Also had quite a time with Foch, but I havehis face in celluloid now.' And he smiled as he deprecatingly lookedup and down my somewhat small and slight figure.This is the last straw. I defy him to photograph me. For from now on Ihave made up my mind that I am going to lock myself in my cabin--I'llfool him.But my whole evening is spoiled. I go to bed cursing themotion-picture industry, the makers of film, and those responsible forcamera men. Why did I take the trip? What is it all for? It has gottenbeyond me already and it is my trip, my vacation.It is early, and I decide to read a bit. I pick up a booklet of poemsby Claude McKay, a young negro poet who is writing splendid verse ofthe inspired sort. Reading a few of his gems, my own annoyances seempuny and almost childish.I read:The Tropics of New York.     Bananas ripe and green, and ginger root,       Cocoa in pods and alligator pears,     And tangerines and mangos and grapefruit,       Fit for the highest prize at parish fairs.     See in the windows, bringing memories       Of fruit trees laden, by low-singing rills,     And dewy dawns and mystical blue skies.       In benediction over nunlike hills.     Mine eyes grow dim and I could no more gaze.       A wave of longing through my body swept,     And a hunger for the old, familiar ways;       I turned aside and bowed my head and wept.I read again:     Lovely, dainty Spanish Needle,       With your yellow flower and white;     Dew-decked and softly sleeping;       Do you think of me to-night?     Shadowed by the spreading mango       Nodding o'er the rippling stream,     Tell me, dear plant of my childhood,       Do you of the exile dream?     Do you see me by the brook's side,       Catching grayfish 'neath the stone,     As you did the day you whispered:       'Leave the harmless dears alone?'     Do you see me in the meadow,       Coming from the woodland spring,     With a bamboo on my shoulder       And a pail slung from a string?     Do you see me, all expectant,       Lying in an orange grove,     While the swee-swees sing above me,       Waiting for my elf-eyed love?     Lovely, dainty Spanish Needle;       Source to me of sweet delight,     In your far-off sunny Southland       Do you dream of me to-night?I am passing this along because I don't believe it is published inthis country, and I feel as though I am extending a rare treat. Theybrought me better rest that night--a splendid sleep.Next morning there were more autograph books and several wirelessmessages from intimate friends wishing me _bon voyage_. They are allvery interesting.Also there are about two hundred ship postcards. Would I mind signingthem for the stewards? I am feeling very good-natured and I enjoysigning anything this morning. I pass the forenoon till lunch time.I really feel as though I haven't met anybody. They say that barriersare lowered aboard ship, but not for me.Ed. Knoblock and I keep very much to ourselves. But all the time Ihave been sort of wondering what became of the beautiful opera singerwho came aboard and was photographed with me. I wonder if beingphotographed together constitutes an introduction? I have not seen hersince the picture.We get seats in deck chairs. Knoblock and myself. Ed. is busy reading_Economic Democracy_ by some one important. I have splendid intentionsof reading Wells's _Outline of History_. My intentions falter after afew paragraphs. I look at the sea, at people passing all around theship. Every once in a while I glance at Knoblock hoping that he isovercome by his book and that he will look up, but Knoblock apparentlyhas no such intention.Suddenly I notice, about twenty chairs away, the beautiful singer. Idon't know why I always have this peculiar embarrassment that grips menow. I am trying to make up my mind to go over and make myself known.No, such an ordeal would be too terrific. The business of makingoneself known is a problem. Here she is within almost speakingdistance and I am not sure whether I shall meet her or not. I glanceaway again. She is looking in my direction. I pretend not to see herand quickly turn my head and get into conversation with Knoblock, whothinks I have suddenly gone insane.'Isn't that lady the opera singer?' I ask.'Yes.'That about expresses his interest.'Shouldn't we go over and make ourselves known?' I suggest.'By all means, if you wish it.' And he is up and off almost before Ican catch my breath.We get up and walk around the deck. I just do not know how to meetpeople. At last the moment comes in the smoking-room, where they arehaving 'log auction.' She is with two gentlemen. We meet. Sheintroduces one as her husband, the other as a friend.She reprimands me for not speaking to her sooner. I try to pretendthat I had not seen her. This amuses her mightily and she becomescharming. We become fast friends. Both she and her husband join us atdinner the following night. We recall mutual friends. Discover thatthere are quite a lot of nice people aboard. She is Mme. Namara and inprivate life Mrs. Guy Bolton, wife of the author of 'Sally.' They areon their way to London where he is to witness the English opening of'Sally.' We have a delightful evening at dinner and then later intheir cabin.IV.HELLO, ENGLAND!Everything sails along smoothly and delightfully until the night ofthe concert for the seaman's fund. This entertainment is customary onall liners and usually is held on the last night out. The passengersprovide the entertainment.I am requested to perform. The thought scares me. It is a greattragedy, and, much as I would like to do something, I am too exhaustedand tired. I beg to be excused, I never like making appearances inpublic. I find that they are always disappointing.I give all manner of reasons for not appearing--one that I have noparticular thing to do, nothing arranged for, that it is against myprinciples because it spoils illusion--especially for the children.When they see me minus my hat, cane, and shoes, it is like taking thewhiskers off Santa Claus. And not having my equipment with me, I feelvery conscious of this. I am always self-conscious when meetingchildren without my make-up for that very reason. I must say theofficers were very sympathetic and understood my reasons for notwanting to appear, and I can assure you that the concert was adistinct success without me. There were music and recitations andsinging and dancing, and one passenger did a whistling act, imitatingvarious birds and animals, also the sawing of wood, with thescreeching sound made when the saw strikes a knot. It was veryeffective.I watched and enjoyed the concert immensely until near the end, whenthe entertainment chairman announced that I was there and that if theaudience urged strongly enough I might do something for them. This wasvery disconcerting, and after I had explained that I was physicallyexhausted and had nothing prepared I am sure the audience understood.The chairman, however, announced that it did not matter, as they couldsee Charlie Chaplin at any time for a nickel--and that's that.The next day is to be the last aboard. We are approaching land. I havegot used to the boat and everybody has got used to me. I have ceasedto be a curiosity. They have taken me at my face value--face withoutmoustache and kindred make-up. We have exchanged addresses, cards,invitations; have made new friends, met a lot of charming people,names too numerous to mention.The lighter is coming out. The top deck is black with men. Somebodytells me they are French and British camera men coming to welcome me.I am up on the top deck, saying good-bye to Mme. Namara and herhusband. They are getting off at Cherbourg. We are staying aboard.Suddenly there is an avalanche. All sorts and conditions of men armedwith pads, pencils, motion-picture cameras, still cameras. There is anembarrassing pause. They are looking for Charlie Chaplin. Some haverecognised me. I see them searching among our little group. EventuallyI am pointed out.'Why, here he is!'My friends suddenly become frightened and desert me. I feel very muchalone, the victim. Square-headed gentlemen with mannersdifferent--they are raising their hats.'Do I speak French?' Some are speaking in French to me--it meansnothing, I am bewildered. Others English. They all seem too curious toeven do their own business. I find that they are personallyinterested. Camera men are forgetting to shoot their pictures.But they recover themselves after their curiosity has been gratified.Then the deluge.'Are you visiting in London?''Why did you come over?''Did you bring your make-up?''Are you going to make pictures over here?'Then from Frenchmen:'Will I visit France?''Am I going to Russia?'I try to answer them all.'Will you visit Ireland?''I don't expect to do so.''What do you think of the Irish question?''It requires too much thought.''Are you a Bolshevik?''I am an artist, not a politician.''Why do you want to visit Russia?''Because I am interested in any new idea.''What do you think of Lenin?''I think him a very remarkable man.''Why?''Because he is expressing a new idea.''Do you believe in Bolshevism?''I am not a politician?'Others ask me to give them a message to France. A message to London.What have I to say to the people of Manchester? Will I meet BernardShaw? Will I meet H. G. Wells? Is it true that I am going to beknighted? How would I solve the unemployment problem?In the midst of all this a rather mysterious gentleman pulls me to oneside and tells me that he knew my father intimately and acted as agentfor him in his music-hall engagements. Did I anticipate working? Ifso, he could get me an engagement. Would I give him the firstopportunity? Anyway, he was very pleased to meet me. If I wanted anice quiet rest I could come down to his place and spend a few dayswith my kind of people, the people I liked.I am rescued by my secretaries, who insist that I go to my cabin andlie down. Anything the newspaper men have to ask they will answer forme. I am dragged away bewildered.Is this what I came six thousand miles for? Is this rest? Where isthat vacation that I pictured so vividly?I lie down and nap until dinner time. I have dinner in my cabin. Nowcomes another great problem.Tipping. One has the feeling that if you are looked at you should tip.One thing that I believe in, though--tipping. It gets you goodservice. It is money well spent. But when and how to tip--that is thequestion. It is a great problem on shipboard.There's the bedroom steward, the waiter, the head waiter, the hallboy,the deck steward, boots, bathroom steward, Turkish bath attendants,gymnasium instructor, smoking-room steward, lounge-room steward, pageboys, elevator boys, barber. It is depressing. I am harassed as towhether to tip the doctor and the captain.I am all excited now; full of expectancy. Wonder what's going tohappen. After my first encounter with fifty newspaper men atCherbourg, somehow I do not resent it. Rather like it, in fact. Beinga personage is not so bad. I am prepared for the fray. It is exciting.I am advancing on Europe. One o'clock. I am in my cabin. We are todock in the morning.I look out of the porthole. I hear voices. They are alongside thedock. Am very emotional now. The mystery of it out there in blacknessenvelops me. I revel in it--its promise. We are at Southampton. We arein England.To-morrow! I go to bed thinking of it. To-morrow!I try to sleep, childishly reasoning that in sleeping I will make thetime pass more quickly. My reasoning was sound, perhaps, but somewherein my anatomy there slipped a cog. I could not sleep. I rolled andtossed, counted sheep, closed my eyes and lay perfectly still, but itwas no go. Somewhere within me there stirred a sort of Christmas Evefeeling. To-morrow was too portentous.I look at my watch. It is two o'clock in the morning. I look throughthe porthole. It is pitch dark outside. I try to pierce the darkness,but can't. Off in the distance I hear voices coming out of the night.That and the lapping of the waves against the side of the boat.Then I hear my name mentioned once, twice, three times. I am thrilled.I tingle with expectancy and varying emotions. It is all so peculiarand mysterious. I try to throw off the feeling. I can't.There seems to be no one awake except a couple of men who are pacingthe deck. Longshoremen, probably. Every once in a while I hear themystic 'Charlie Chaplin' mentioned. I peer through the porthole. It isstarting to rain. This adds to the spell. I turn out the lights andget back to bed and try to sleep. I get up again and look out.I call Robinson. 'Can you sleep?' I ask.'No. Let's get up and dress.' It's got him, too.We get up and walk around the top deck. There is a curious mixture offeelings all at once. I am thrilled and depressed. I cannot understandthe depression. We keep walking around the deck, looking over theside. People are looking up, but they don't recognise me in the night.I feel myself speculating, wondering if it is going to be the welcomeI am expecting.Scores of messages have been arriving all day.'Will you accept engagements?' 'Will you dine with us?' 'How about afew days in the country?' I cannot possibly answer them all. Notreceiving replies, they send wireless messages to the captain.'Mr. Lathom, is Mr. Chaplin on board?' 'Has my message beendelivered?'I have never received so many messages. 'Will you appear on Tuesday?''Will you dine here?' 'Will you join a revue?' 'Are you open forengagements?' 'I am the greatest agent in the world.'One of the messages is from the Mayor of Southampton, welcoming me tothat city. Others from heads of the motion-picture industry in Europe.This is a source of great worriment. Welcomed by the mayor. It willprobably mean a speech. I hate speeches, I can't make them. This isthe worst spectre of the night.In my sleeplessness I go back to my cabin and try to write down what Ishall say, trying to anticipate what the mayor will say to me. Ipicture his speech of welcome. A masterpiece of oratory brought forthafter much preparation by those who are always making speeches. It istheir game, this speech-making, and I know I shall appear a hopelessdub with my reply.But I attack it valiantly. I write sentence after sentence and thenpractise before the mirror.'Mr. Mayor and the people of Southampton.' The face that peers back atme from the mirror looks rather silly. I think of Los Angeles andwonder how they would take my speech there. But I persevere. I writemore. I overcome that face in the looking-glass to such an extent thatI want a wider audience.I call Carl Robinson. I make him sit still and listen. I make myspeech several times. He is kind the first time and the second time,but after that he begins to get fidgety. He makes suggestions. I takeout some lines and put in others. I decide that it is prepared andleave it. I am to meet the mayor in the morning at eight o'clock.Eventually I get to bed and asleep, a fitful, tossing sleep. They wakeme in the morning. People are outside my door. Carl comes in.'The mayor is upstairs waiting for you.' I am twenty minutes late.This adds to my inefficiency.I am pushed and tumbled into my clothes, then taken by the arm, as ifI were about to be arrested, and led from my cabin. Good Lord! I'veforgotten my slip--my speech, my answer to the mayor, with itsplatform gestures that I had laboured with during the long night. Ibelieved that I had created some new gestures never before attemptedon platform, or in pulpit, but I was lost without my copy.But there is little time for regrets. It doesn't take long to reachany place when that place is holding something fearful for you. I wasbefore the mayor long before I was ready to see him.This mayor wasn't true to type. He was more like a schoolmaster. Verypleasant and concise, with tortoiseshell rims to his glasses and withnone of the ornaments of chain and plush that I had anticipated aspart of the regalia of his office. This was somewhat of a relief.There are lots of men, women and children gathered about. I amintroduced to the children. I am whirled around into the crowd, andwhen I turn back I can't quite make out who is the mayor. There seemsto be a roomful of mayors. Eventually I am dug from behind. I turn. Iam whirled back by friendly or official assistance. Ah, here is themayor.  [Illustration: I am welcomed by the Mayor of Southampton.]I stand bewildered, twirling my thumbs, quite at a loss as to what isexpected of me.The mayor begins. I have been warned that it is going to be veryformal.'Mr. Chaplin, on behalf of the citizens of Southampton--'Nothing like I had anticipated. I am trying to think. Trying to hearprecisely what he says. I think I have him so far. But it is nothinglike I had anticipated. My speech doesn't seem to fit what he issaying. I can't help it. I will use it anyhow, at least as much as Ican recall.It is over. I mumble some inane appreciation. Nothing like I hadwritten, with nary a gesture so laboriously rehearsed.There comes interruptions of excited mothers with their children.'This is my little girl.'I am shaking hands mechanically with everybody. From all sidesautograph albums are being shoved under my nose. Carl is warding themoff, protecting me as much as possible.I am aware that the mayor is still standing there. I am trying tothink of something more to say. All visions of language seem to haveleft me. I find myself mumbling. 'This is nice of you' and 'I am veryglad to meet you all.'Somebody whispers in my ear, 'Say something about the English cinema.''Say a word of welcome to the English.' I try to and can't utter aword, but the same excitement that had bothered me now comes forwardto my aid.The whole thing is bewildering and thrilling and I find that I ampleased with it all.But now strange faces seem to fade out and familiar ones take theirplaces. There is Tom Geraghty, who used to be Doug Fairbanks'sscenario writer. He wrote 'When the Clouds Roll By' and 'TheMollycoddle.' Tom is a great friend of mine and we have spent many apleasant hour in Doug's home in Los Angeles. There is Donald Crisp,who played Battling Burrows in 'Broken Blossoms,' a clubmate in theLos Angeles Athletic Club.My cousin, Aubrey Chaplin, a rather dignified gentleman, but with allthe earmarks of a Chaplin, greets me.Heavens! I look something like him. I picture myself in another fiveyears. Aubrey has a saloon in quite a respectable part of London. Ifeel that Aubrey is a nice simple soul and quite desirous of taking mein hand.Then Abe Breman, manager of the United Artists' affairs in England.And there is 'Sonny,' a friend in the days when I was on the stage. Ihave not heard from him in ten years. It makes me happy andinterested, the thought of reviving the old friendship.We talk of all sorts of subjects. Sonny is prosperous and doing well.He tells me everything in jerky asides, as we are hustled about amidstthe baggage and bundled into a compartment that somebody has arranged.Somehow the crowds here are not so large as I had anticipated. I am alittle shocked. What if they don't turn up? Every one has tried toimpress upon me the size of the reception I am to get. There is atinge of disappointment, but then I am informed that, the boat beinga day late, the crowd expected had no way of knowing when I wouldarrive.This explanation relieves me tremendously, though it is not so muchfor myself that I feel this, but for my companions and my friends, whoexpect so much. I feel that the whole thing should go off with a bangfor their sake. Yes, I do.But I am in England. There is freshness. There is glow. There isNature in its most benevolent mood. The trains, those little toytrains with the funny little wheels like those on a child's toy. Thereare strange noises. They come from the engine--snorting, explosivesounds, as though it was clamoring for attention.I am in another world. Southampton, though I have been there before,is absolutely strange to me. There is nothing familiar. I feel asthough I am in a foreign country. Crowds, increasing with everyminute. What lovely women, different from American women. How, why, Icannot tell.There is a beautiful girl peering at me, a lovely English type. Shecomes to the carriage and in a beautiful, musical voice says, 'May Ihave your signature, Mr. Chaplin?' This is thrilling. Aren't Englishgirls charming? She is just the type you see in pictures, somethinglike Hall Caine's Gloria in _The Christian_--beautiful auburn hair,about seventeen.Seventeen! What an age! I was that once--and here, in England. Itseems very long ago.Tom Geraghty and the bunch, we are all so excited we don't know justwhat to do or how to act. We cannot collect ourselves. Bursting withpent-up questions of years of gathering, overflowing with importantmessages for one another, we are talking about the most commonplacethings. I find that I am not listening to them, nor they to me. I amjust taking it all in, eyes and ears.An English 'bobby.' Everything is different. Taking the tickets. Thewhole thing is upside down. The locking us in our compartment. I lookat the crowds. The same old 'prop' smile is working. They smile. Theycheer. I wave my hat. I feel silly, but it seems that they like it.Will the train never start? I want to see something outside thestation.I want to see the country. They are all saying things. I do not knowwhat they all think of me, my friends. I wish they were not here. Iwould love to be alone so that I could get it all.We are moving. I sit forward as though to make the train go faster. Iwant a sight of Old England. I want more than a sight.Now I see the English country. New houses going up everywhere. Newtypes for labouring men. More new houses. I have never seen OldEngland in such a frenzy of building. The brush fields are ratherburned up. This is something new for England, for it is always sogreen. It is not as green as it used to be. But it is England, and Iam loving every mile of it.I discover that everything is Los Angeles in my compartment, with theexception of my cousin and Sonny. Here I am in the midst of Hollywood.I have travelled six thousand miles to get away from Hollywood. Motionpictures are universal. You can't run away from them. But I am notbothering much, because I am cannily figuring on shaking the whole lotof them after the usual dinner and getting off by myself.And I am getting new thrills every minute. There are people waitingall along the line, at small stations, waiting for the train to pass.I know they are waiting to see me. It's a wonderful sensation--everybodyso affectionate. Gee! I am wondering what's going to happen in London?Aubrey and the bunch are talking about making a strong-arm squadaround me for protection. I intimately feel that it is not going to benecessary. They say: 'Ah, you don't know, my boy. Wait until you getto London.'Secretly, I am hoping it is true. But I have my doubts. Everybody isnice. They suggest that I should sleep awhile, as I look tired. I feelthat I am being pampered and spoiled. But I like it. And they all seemto understand.My cousin interests me. He warns me what to talk about. At first Ifelt a little conscious in his presence. A little sensitive. Hispersonality--how it mixes with my American friends. I sense that I amshocking him with my American points of view.He has not seen me in ten years. I know that I am altered. I sort ofwant to pose before him a little. I want to shock him; no, not exactlyshock him, but surprise him. I find myself deliberately posing andjust for him. I want to be different, and I want him to know that I ama different person. This is having its effect.Aubrey is bewildered. I am sure that he doesn't know me. I feel that Iam not acting according to his schedule. It encourages me.I become radical in my ideas. Against his conservatism. But I ambeginning not to like this performing for him. One feels so conscious.I am wondering whether he will understand. There are lots of otherpeople I have got to meet. I won't be able to devote all my time tohim. I shall have a long talk with Aubrey later and explaineverything. I doze off for a while.But just for a moment. We are coming to the outskirts of London. Ihear nothing, I see nothing, but I know it is so and I awake. Now I amall expectancy. We are entering the suburbs of the city.V.I ARRIVE IN LONDONLondon! There are familiar buildings. This is thrilling. The samebuildings. They have not altered. I expected that England would bealtered. It isn't. It's the same. The same as I left it, in spite ofthe War. I see no change, not even in the manner of the people.There's Doulton's Potteries! And look, there's the Queen's Headpublic-house that my cousin used to own. I point it out to himdecidedly, but he reminds me that he has a much better place now. Nowwe are coming into the Cut. Can it be true? I can see two or threefamiliar stores. This train is going too fast. I want more time withthese discoveries. I find my emotions almost too much for me. I havemore sentiment about the buildings than I have the people.The recognition of these localities! There is a lump rising in mythroat from somewhere. It is something inexplicable. They are there,thank God!If I could only be alone with it all. With it as it is, and with it asI would people it with ghosts of yesterday. I wish these peopleweren't in the compartment. I am afraid of my emotions.The dear old Cut. We are getting into it now. Here we are. There areall conceivable kinds of noises, whistles, etc. Crowds, throngs linedup on the platforms. Here comes a police sergeant looking for aculprit. He looks straight at me. Good Lord! I am going to bearrested! But no, he smiles.A shout, 'There he is!'Previous to this we had made resolutions. 'Don't forget we are all tolock arms, Knoblock, my cousin, Robinson, Geraghty, and myself.'Immediately I get out of the train, however, we somehow getdisorganised and our campaign manoeuvre is lost. Policemen take meby each arm. There are motion-picture men, still-camera men. I see asign announcing that motion pictures of my trip on board ship will beshown that night at a picture theatre. That dogged photographer of theboat must have gotten something in spite of me.I am walking along quite the centre of things. I feel like royalty. Ifind I am smiling. A regular smile. I distinguish distant faces amongthose who crowd about me. There are voices at the end of the platform.'Here he is. He is there, he is. That's him.' My step is lightninggay. I am enjoying each moment. I am in Waterloo Station, London.The policemen are very excited. It is going to be a terrible ordealfor them. Thousands are outside. This also thrills me. Everything isbeyond my expectations. I revel in it secretly. They all stop toapplaud as I come to the gate. Some of them say:'Well done, Charlie.' I wonder if they mean my present stunt betweenthe bobbies. It is too much for me.What have I done? I feel like a cricketer who has made a hundred andis going to the stand. There is real warm affection. Do I deserve evena part of it?A young girl rushes out, breaks the line, makes one leap, and smothersme with a kiss. Thank God, she is pretty. There seem to be othersready to follow her, and I find myself hesitating a bit on my way. Itis a signal. The barriers are broken.They are coming on all sides. Policemen are elbowing and pushing.Girls are shrieking.'Charlie! Charlie! There he is! Good luck to you. Charlie. God blessyou.' Old men, old women, girls, boys, all in one excited thrill. Myfriends are missing. We are fighting our way through the crowd. I donot mind it at all. I am being carried on the crest of a wave.Everybody is working but me. There seems to be no effort. I amenjoying it--lovely.Eventually we get through to the street. It is worse here. 'Hooray!''Here he is!' 'Good luck, Charlie!' 'Well done, Charlie!' 'God blessyou. God love you!' 'Good luck, Charlie!' Bells are ringing.Handkerchiefs are waving. Some are raising their hats. I have lostmine. I am bewildered, at a loss, wondering where it is all leadingto, but I don't care. I love to stay in it.Suddenly there is a terrific crash. Various currents of the crowd arebattling against one another. I find that now I am concerned about myfriends. Where's Tom? Where's So-and-so? Where's Carl? Where's mycousin? I'm asking it all aloud, on all sides, of anyone who willlisten to me. I am answered with smiles.I am being pushed toward an automobile.'Where's my cousin?' Another push.Policemen on all sides. I am pushed and lifted and almost dumped intothe limousine. My hat is thrown in behind me. There are threepolicemen on each side of the car, standing on the running board. Ican't get out. They are telling the chauffeur to drive on. He seems tobe driving right over the people. Occasionally a head, a smiling face,a hand, a hat flashes by the door of the car. I ask and keep asking,'Where's my cousin?'But I regain myself, straighten my clothes, cool off a bit, and lookround. There is a perfect stranger in the limousine with me. I seem totake him for granted for the moment. He is also cut up and bleeding.Evidently he is somebody. He must be on the schedule to do something.He looks bewildered and confused.I say, 'Well--I have missed my cousin.'He says, 'I beg your pardon, I have not been introduced to you.''Do you know where we are going?' I ask.He says, 'No.''Well, what are you doing--Who are you?' I splutter.'No one in particular,' he answers. 'I have been pushed in hereagainst my will. I think it was the second time you cried for yourcousin. One of the cops picked me, but I don't believe there is anyrelationship.'We laugh. That helps. We pull up and he is politely let off at thecorner. As quickly as possible he is shut out. Crowds are around onboth sides, raising their hats English fashion, as though they weremeeting a lady. The mounted policemen leave us. I am left alone withmy thoughts.If I could only do something--solve the unemployment problem or makesome grand gesture--in answer to all this. I look through the windowin the back of the car. There are a string of taxis following behind.In the lead, seated on top of the cab, is a young and pretty girl alldressed in scarlet. She is waving to me as she chases. What a pictureshe makes! I think what good fun it would be to get on top of the cabwith her and race around through the country.I feel like doing something big. What an opportunity for a politicianto say something and do something big! I never felt such affection. Weare going down York Road. I see placards, 'Charlie Arrives.' Crowdsstanding on the corner, all lined up along my way to the hotel. I ambeginning to wonder what it's all about.Am feeling a bit reflective, after all, thinking over what I havedone; it has not been very much. Nothing to call forth all this.'Shoulder Arms' was pretty good, perhaps, but all this clamour over amoving-picture actor!Now we are passing over Westminster Bridge. There are double-deckedstreet cars. There's one marked 'Kennington.'I want to get out and get on it--I want to go to Kennington. Thebridge is so small; I always thought it was much wider. We are held upby traffic. The driver tells the bobby that Charlie Chaplin is inside.There is a change in the expression of the cop.'On your way.'By this time the policemen have dropped off the side of the car andare on their way back. Once more I am a private citizen. I am just abit sad at this. Being a celebrity has its nice points.There is an auto with a motion-picture camera on top of itphotographing our car. I tell the driver to put down the top. Whydidn't we do this before? I wanted to let the people see. It seemed ashame to hide in this way. I wanted to be seen. There are littlecrowds on the street corners again.Ah yes, and Big Ben. It looks so small now. It was so big before Iwent away. We are turning up the Haymarket. People are looking andwaving from their windows. I wave back. Crowded streets. We arenearing the Ritz, where I am to stop.The crowds are much denser here. I am at a loss. I don't know what todo, what to say. I stand up. I wave and bow at them, smile at them,and go through the motions of shaking hands, using my own hands.Should I say something? Can I say anything? I feel the genuineness ofit all, a real warmth. It is very touching. This is almost too muchfor me. I am afraid I am going to make a scene.I stand up. The crowd comes to a hush. It is attentive. They see I amabout to say something. I am surprised at my own voice. I can hear it.It is quite clear and distinct, saying something about its being agreat moment, etc. But tame and stupid as it is, they like it.There is a 'Hooray!' 'Good boy, Charlie!'Now the problem is how am I going to get out of this? The police arethere, pushing and shoving people aside to make way, but they areout-numbered. There are motion-picture cameras, cameras on the steps.The crowds close in. Then I step out. They close in. I am stillsmiling. I try to think of something useful, learned from myexperience at the New York opening of 'The Three Musketeers.' But I amnot much help to my comrades.Then as we approach, the tide comes in toward the gates of the hotel.They have been kept locked to prevent the crowd from demolishing thebuilding. I can see one intrepid motion-picture camera man at the dooras the crowd starts to swarm. He begins to edge in, and startsgrinding his camera frantically as he is lifted into the whirlpool ofhumanity. But he keeps turning, and his camera and himself aregradually turned up to the sky, and his lens is registering nothingbut clouds as he goes down turning--the most honorable fall a cameraman can have, to go down grinding. I wonder if he really got anypictures.In some way my body has been pushed, carried, lifted, and projectedinto the hotel. I can assure you that through no action of mine wasthis accomplished. I am immediately introduced to some Englishnobleman. The air is electric. I feel now I am free. Everybody issmiling. Everybody is interested. I am shown to a suite of rooms.I like the hotel lobby. It is grand. I am raced to my room. There arebouquets of flowers from two or three English friends whom I hadforgotten. There come cards. I want to welcome them all. Do not mindin the least. Am out for the whole day of it. The crowds are outside.The manager presents himself. Everything has been spread to make mystay as happy as possible.The crowd outside is cheering. What is the thing to do? I had bettergo to the window. I raise my hands again. I pantomime, shake handswith myself, throw them kisses. I see a bouquet of roses in the room.I grab it and start tossing the flowers into the crowd. There is a madscramble for the souvenirs. In a moment the chief of police burstsinto my room.'Please, Mr. Chaplin, it is very fine, but don't throw anything. Youwill cause an accident. They will be crushed and killed. Anything butthat, don't throw anything. If you don't mind, kindly refrain fromthrowing anything.' Excitedly he repeats his message over and overagain.Of course I don't mind; the flowers are all gone, anyway. But I amtheatrically concerned. 'Ah, really I am so sorry. Has anythinghappened?' I feel that everything is all right.The rest of my friends arrive all bruised and cut up. Now that theexcitement has died down, what are we going to do? For no reason atall we order a meal. Nobody is hungry. I want to get out again. Wish Icould.I feel that everybody ought to leave immediately. I want to be alone.I want to get out and escape from all crowds. I want to get overLondon, over to Kennington, all by myself. I want to see some familiarsights. Here baskets of fruit keep pouring in, fresh bouquets,presents, trays full of cards, some of them titles, some well-knownnames--all paying their respects. Now I am muddled. I don't know whatto do first. There is too much waiting. I have too much of a choice.But I must get over to Kennington, and to-day. I am nervous,overstrung, tense. Crowds are still outside. I must go again and bowand wave my hands. I am used to it, am doing it mechanically; it hasno effect. Lunch is ordered for everybody. Newspaper men are outside,visitors are outside. I tell Carl to get them to put it off untilto-morrow. He tells them that I am tired, need a rest, for them tocall to-morrow and they will be given an interview.The bishop of something presents his compliments. He is in the roomwhen I arrive. I can't hear what he is saying. I said 'yes, I shall bedelighted.' We sit down to lunch. What a crowd there is eating withme! I am not quite sure I know them all.Everyone is making plans for me. This irritates me. My cousin, TomGeraghty, Knoblock--would I spend two or three days in the country andget a rest? No. I don't want to rest. Will you see somebody? I don'twant to see anybody. I want to be left entirely alone. I've just gotto have my whim.I make a pretence at lunch. I whisper to Carl, 'You explain everythingto them--tell them that I am going out immediately after lunch.' I ammerely taking the lunch to discipline myself.I look out the window. The crowds are still there. What a problem! Howam I going to get out without being recognised? Shall I openly suggestgoing out, so I can get away? I hate disappointing them. But I must goout.Tom Geraghty, Donald Crisp, and myself suggest taking a walk. I donot tell them my plans, merely suggest taking the walk. We go throughthe back way and escape. I am sure that everything is all right, andthat no one will recognise me. I cannot stand the strain any longer. Itell Donald and Tom--they really must leave me alone. I want to bealone, and want to visit alone. They understand. Tom is a good sortand so is Donald. I do not want to ride, but just for a quicker meansof getting away I call a taxicab.I tell him to drive to Lambeth. He is a good driver, and an old one.He has not recognised me, thank heaven!But he is going too fast. I tell him to drive slower, to take histime. I sit back now. I am passing Westminster Bridge again. I see itbetter. Things are more familiar. On the other side is the new LondonCounty Council building. They have been building it for years. Theystarted it before I left.The Westminster Road has become very dilapidated, but perhaps it isbecause I am riding in an automobile. I used to travel across itanother way. It doesn't seem so long ago, either.My God! Look! Under the bridge! There's the old blind man. I stop thedriver and drive back. We pull up outside the Canterbury.'You wait there, or do you want me to pay you off?' He will wait. Iwalk back.There he is, the same old figure, the same old blind man I used to seeas a child of five, with the same old earmuffs, with his back againstthe wall and the same stream of greasy water trickling down the stonebehind his back.The same old clothes, a bit greener with age, and the irregular bushof whiskers coloured almost in a rainbow array, but with a dirty greypredominant.What a symbol from which to count the years that I had been away. Alittle more green to his clothes! A bit more grey in his matted beard!He has that same stark look in his eyes that used to make me sick as achild. Everything exactly the same, only a bit more dilapidated.No. There is a change. The dirty little mat for the unhealthy-lookingpup with the watering eyes that used to be with him--that is gone. Iwould like to hear the story of the missing pup.Did its passing make much difference to the lonely derelict? Was itsending a tragic one, dramatic, or had it just passed out naturally?The old man is laboriously reading the same chapter from his old,greasy, and bethumbed embossed Bible. His lips move, but silently, ashis fingers travel over the letters. I wonder if he gets comfortthere? Or does he need comfort?To me it is all too horrible. He is the personification of poverty atits worst, sunk in that inertia that comes of lost hope. It is tooterrible.V
INFP	THE HAUNTS OF MY CHILDHOODI jump into the automobile again and we drive along past ChristChurch. There's Baxter Hall, where we used to see magic-lantern slidesfor a penny. The forerunner of the movie of to-day. I see significancein everything around me. You could get a cup of coffee and a piece ofcake there and see the Crucifixion of Christ all at the same time.We are passing the police station. A drear place to youth. KenningtonRoad is more intimate. It has grown beautiful in its decay. There issomething fascinating about it.Sleepy people seem to be living in the streets more than they used towhen I played there. Kennington Baths, the reason for many a day'shookey. You could go swimming there, second class, for three pence (ifyou brought your own swimming trunks).Through Brook Street to the upper Bohemian quarter, where third-ratemusic-hall artists appear. All the same, a little more decayed,perhaps. And yet it is not just the same.I am seeing it through other eyes. Age trying to look back through theeyes of youth. A common pursuit, though a futile one.It is bringing home to me that I am a different person. It takes theform of art; it is beautiful. I am very impersonal about it. It isanother world, and yet in it I recognise something, as though in adream.We pass the Kennington 'pub,' Kennington Cross, Chester Street, whereI used to sleep. The same, but, like its brother landmarks, a bit moredilapidated. There is the old tub outside the stables where I used towash. The same old tub, a little more twisted.I tell the driver to pull up again. 'Wait a moment.' I do not knowwhy, but I want to get out and walk. An automobile has no place inthis setting. I have no particular place to go. I just walk along downChester Street. Children are playing, lovely children. I see myselfamong them back there in the past. I wonder if any of them will comeback some day and look around enviously at other children.Somehow they seem different from those children with whom I used toplay. Sweeter, more dainty were these little, begrimed kids with theirarms entwined around one another's waists. Others, little girlsmostly, sitting on the doorsteps, with dolls, with sewing, all playingat that universal game of 'mothers.'For some reason I feel choking up. As I pass they look up. Franklyand without embarrassment they look at the stranger with theirbeautiful, kindly eyes. They smile at me. I smile back. Oh, if I couldonly do something for them. These waifs with scarcely any chance atall.Now a woman passes with a can of beer. With a white skirt hangingdown, trailing at the back. She treads on it. There, she has done itagain. I want to shriek with laughter at the joy of being in this sameold familiar Kennington. I love it.It is all so soft, so musical; there is so much affection in thevoices. They seem to talk from their souls. There are the inflectionsthat carry meanings, even if words were not understood. I think ofAmericans and myself. Our speech is hard, monotonous, except whereexcitement makes it more noisy.There is a barber shop where I used to be the lather boy. I wonder ifthe same old barber is still there? I look. No, he is gone. I see twoor three kiddies playing on the porch. Foolish, I give them something.It creates attention. I am about to be discovered.I leap into the taxi again and ride on. We drive around until I haveescaped from the neighbourhood where suspicion has been planted andcome to the beginning of Lambeth Walk. I get out and walk along amongthe crowds.People are shopping. How lovely the cockneys are! How romantic thefigures, how sad, how fascinating! Their lovely eyes. How patient theyare! Nothing conscious about them. No affectation, just themselves,their beautifully gay selves, serene in their limitations, perfect intheir type.I am the wrong note in this picture that nature has concentrated here.My clothes are a bit conspicuous in this setting, no matter howunobtrusive my thoughts and actions. Dressed as I am, one neverstrolls along Lambeth Walk.I feel the attention I am attracting. I put my handkerchief to myface. People are looking at me, at first slyly, then insistently. Whoam I? For a moment I am caught unawares.A girl comes up--thin, narrow-chested, but with an eagerness in hereyes that lifts her above any physical defects.'Charlie, don't you know me?'Of course I know her. She is all excited, out of breath. I can almostfeel her heart thumping with emotion as her narrow chest heaves withher hurried breathing. Her face is ghastly white, a girl abouttwenty-eight. She has a little girl with her.This girl was a little servant girl who used to wait on us at thecheap lodging-house where I lived. I remembered that she had left indisgrace. There was tragedy in it. But I could detect a certain savagegloriousness in her. She was carrying on with all odds against her.Hers is the supreme battle of our age. May she and all others of herkind meet a kindly fate.With pent-up feelings we talk about the most commonplace things.'Well, how are you, Charlie?''Fine.' I point to the little girl. 'Is she your little girl?'She says, 'Yes.'That's all, but there doesn't seem to be much need of conversation. Wejust look and smile at each other and we both weave the other's storyhurriedly through our own minds by way of the heart. Perhaps in ourweaving we miss a detail or two, but substantially we are right. Thereis warmth in the renewed acquaintance. I feel that in this moment Iknow her better than I ever did in the many months I used to see herin the old days. And right now I feel that she is worth knowing.There's a crowd gathering. It's come. I am discovered, with no chancefor escape. I give the girl some money to buy something for the child,and hurry on my way. She understands and smiles. Crowds are following.I am discovered in Lambeth Walk.But they are so charming about it. I walk along and they keep behindat an almost standard distance. I can feel rather than hear theirshuffling footsteps as they follow along, getting no closer, losing noground. It reminds me of the Pied Piper of Hamelin.All these people just about five yards away, all timid, thrilled,excited at hearing my name, but not having the courage to shout itunder this spell.'There he is.' 'That's 'im.' All in whispers hoarse with excitementand carrying for great distance, but at the same time repressed bythe effort of whispering. What manners these cockneys have! The crowdsaccumulate. I am getting very much concerned. Sooner or later they aregoing to come up, and I am alone, defenceless. What folly this goingout alone, and along Lambeth Walk!Eventually I see a bobby, a sergeant--or, rather, I think him one, helooks so immaculate in his uniform. I go to him for protection.'Do you mind?' I say. 'I find I have been discovered. I am CharlieChaplin. Would you mind seeing me to a taxi?''That's all right, Charlie. These people won't hurt you. They are thebest people in the world. I have been with them for fifteen years.' Hespeaks with a conviction that makes me feel silly and deservedlyrebuked.I say, 'I know it; they are perfectly charming.''That's just it,' he answers. 'They are charming and nice.'They had hesitated to break in upon my solitude, but now, sensing thatI have protection, they speak out.'Hello, Charlie!' 'God bless you, Charlie!' 'Good luck to you, lad!'As each flings his or her greetings they smile and self-consciouslyback away into the group, bringing others to the fore for theirgreeting. All of them have a word--old women, men, children. I amalmost overcome with the sincerity of their welcome.We are moving along and come to a street corner and into KenningtonRoad again. The crowds continue following as though I were theirleader, with nobody daring to approach within a certain radius.The little cockney children circle around me to get a view from allsides.I see myself among them. I, too, had followed celebrities in my timein Kennington. I, too, had pushed, edged, and fought my way to thefront rank of crowds, led by curiosity. They are in rags, the samerags, only more ragged.They are looking into my face and smiling, showing their blackenedteeth. Good God! English children's teeth are terrible! Something canand should be done about it. But their eyes!Soulful eyes with such a wonderful expression. I see a young girlglance slyly at her beau. What a beautiful look she gives him! I findmyself wondering if he is worthy, if he realises the treasure that ishis. What a lovely people!We are waiting. The policeman is busy hailing a taxi. I just standthere self-conscious. Nobody asks any questions. They are content tolook. Their steadfast watching is so impressing. I feel small--like acheat. Their worship does not belong to me. God, if I could only dosomething for all of them!But there are too many--too many. Good impulses so often die beforethis 'too many.'I am in the taxi.'Good-bye, Charlie! God bless you!' I am on my way.The taxi is going up Kennington Road along Kennington Park. KenningtonPark. How depressing Kennington Park is! How depressing to me are allparks! The loneliness of them. One never goes to a park unless one islonesome. And lonesomeness is sad. The symbol of sadness, that's apark.But I am fascinated now with it. I am lonesome and want to be. I wantto commune with myself and the years that are gone. The years thatwere passed in the shadow of this same Kennington Park. I want to siton its benches again in spite of their treacherous bleakness, in spiteof the drabness.But I am in a taxi. And taxis move fast. The park is out of sight. Itsalluring spell is dismissed with its passing. I did not sit on thebench. We are driving toward Kennington Gate.Kennington Gate. That has its memories. Sad, sweet, rapidly recurringmemories.'Twas here, my first appointment with Hetty (Sonny's sister). How Iwas dolled up in my little, tight-fitting frock coat, hat, and cane! Iwas quite the dude as I watched every street car until four o'clockwaiting for Hetty to step off, smiling as she saw me waiting.I get out and stand there for a few moments at Kennington Gate. Mytaxi driver thinks I am mad. But I am forgetting taxi drivers. I amseeing a lad of nineteen, dressed to the pink, with fluttering heart,waiting, waiting for the moment of the day when he and happinesswalked along the road. The road is so alluring now. It beckons foranother walk, and as I hear a street car approaching I turn eagerly,for the moment almost expecting to see the same trim Hetty step off,smiling.The car stops. A couple of men get off. An old woman. Some children.But no Hetty.Hetty is gone. So is the lad with the frock coat and cane.Back into the cab, we drive up Brixton Road. We pass GlenshoreMansions--a more prosperous neighbourhood. Glenshore Mansions, whichmeant a step upward to me, where I had my Turkish carpets and my redlights in the beginning of my prosperity.We pull up at The Horns for a drink. The same Horns. Used to adjointhe saloon bar. It has changed. Its arrangement is different. I do notrecognise the keeper. I feel very much the foreigner now; do not knowwhat to order. I am out of place. There's a barmaid.How strange, this lady with the coiffured hair and neat littleshirtwaist!'What can I do for you, sir?'I am swept off my feet. Impressed. I want to feel very much theforeigner. I find myself acting.'What have you got?'She looks surprised.'Ah, give me ginger beer.' I find myself becoming a little bitaffected. I refuse to understand the money--the shillings and thepence. It is thoroughly explained to me as each piece is countedbefore me. I go over each one separately and then leave it all on thetable.There are two women seated at a near-by table. One is whispering tothe other. I am recognised.'That's 'im; I tell you 'tis.''Ah, get out! And wot would 'e be a-doin' 'ere?'I pretend not to hear, not to notice. But it is too ominous. Suddenlya white funk comes over me and I rush out and into the taxi again.It's closing time for a part of the afternoon. Something different. Iam surprised. It makes me think it is Sunday. Then I learn that it isa new rule in effect since the war.I am driving down Kennington Road again. Passing Kennington Cross.Kennington Cross.It was here that I first discovered music, or where I first learnedits rare beauty, a beauty that has gladdened and haunted me from thatmoment. It all happened one night while I was there, about midnight. Irecall the whole thing so distinctly.I was just a boy, and its beauty was like some sweet mystery. I didnot understand. I only knew I loved it and I became reverent as thesounds carried themselves through my brain _via_ my heart.I suddenly became aware of a harmonica and a clarinet playing a weird,harmonious message. I learned later that it was 'The Honeysuckle andthe Bee.' It was played with such feeling that I became conscious forthe first time of what melody really was. My first awakening to music.I remembered how thrilled I was as the sweet sounds pealed into thenight. I learned the words the next day. How I would love to hear itnow, that same tune, that same way!Conscious of it, yet defiant, I find myself singing the refrain softlyto myself:     You are the honey, honeysuckle. I am the bee;     I'd like to sip the honey, dear, from those red lips. You see     I love you dearie, dearie, and I want you to love me--     You are my honey, honeysuckle. I am your bee.Kennington Cross, where music first entered my soul. Trivial, perhaps,but it was the first time.There are a few stragglers left as I pass on my way along ManchesterBridge at the Prince Road. They are still watching me. I feel thatKennington Road is alive to the fact that I am in it. I am hoping thatthey are feeling that I have come back, not that I am a stranger inthe public eye.I am on my way back. Crossing Westminster Bridge. I enter a new land.I go back to the Haymarket, back to the Ritz to dress for dinner.VI
INFP	A JOKE AND STILL ON THE GOIn the evening I dined at the Ritz with Ed. Knoblock, Miss Forrest,and several other friends. The party was a very congenial one and thedinner excellent. It did much to lift me from the depression intowhich the afternoon in Kennington had put me.Following dinner we said 'Good night' to Miss Forrest, and the rest ofus went around to Ed. Knoblock's apartment in the Albany. The Albanyis the most interesting building I have yet visited in London.In a sort of dignified grandeur it stands swathed in an atmosphere oftradition. It breathes the past, and such a past! It has housed menlike Shelley and Edmund Burke and others whose fame is linked closelywith the march of English civilisation.Naturally, the building is very old. Ed.'s apartment commands awonderful view of London. It is beautifully and artisticallyfurnished, its high ceilings, its tapestries, and its old Victorianwindows giving it a quaintness rather startling in this modern age.We had a bit of supper, and about eleven-thirty it began to rain, andlater there was a considerable thunderstorm.Conversation, languishing on general topics, turns to me, the what andwherefore of my coming and going, my impressions, plans, etc. I tellthem as best I can.Knoblock is anxious to get my views on England, on the impression thatLondon has made. We discuss the matter and make comparisons. I feelthat England has acquired a sadness, something that is tragic and atthe same time beautiful.We discuss my arrival. How wonderful it was. The crowds, thereception. Knoblock thinks that it is the apex of my career. I aminclined to agree with him.Whereupon Tom Geraghty comes forward with a startling thought. Tomsuggests that I die immediately. He insists that this is the onlyfitting thing to do, that to live after such a reception and ovationwould be an anti-climax. The artistic thing to do would be to finishoff my career with a spectacular death. Everyone is shocked at hissuggestion. But I agree with Tom that it would be a great climax. Weare all becoming very sentimental; we insist to one another that wemust not think such thoughts, and the like.The lightning is flashing fitfully outside. Knoblock, with aninspiration, gathers all of us, except Tom Geraghty, into a corner andsuggests that on the next flash of lightning, just for a joke, Ipretend to be struck dead, to see what effect it would have on Tom.We make elaborate plans rapidly. Each is assigned to his part in theimpromptu tragedy. We give Tom another drink and start to talkingabout death and kindred things. Then we all comment how the wind isshaking this old building, how its windows rattle and the weird effectthat lightning has on its old tapestries and lonely candlesticks.Surreptitiously, some one has turned out all but one light, but oldTom does not suspect.The atmosphere is perfect for our hoax and several of us who are 'inthe know' feel sort of creepy as we wait for the next flash. I primemyself for the bit of acting.The flash comes, and with it I let forth a horrible shriek, then standup, stiffen, and fall flat on my face. I think I did it rather well,and I am not sure but that others beside Tom were frightened.Tom drops his whisky glass and exclaims: 'My God! It's happened!' andhis voice is sober. But no one pays any attention to him.They all rush to me and I am carried feet first into the bedroom, andthe door closed on poor old Tom, who is trying to follow me in. Tomjust paces the floor, waiting for some one to come from the bedroomand tell him what has happened. He knocks on the door several times,but no one will let him in.  [Illustration: My 'property grin.']Finally, Carl Robinson comes out of the room, looking seriouslyintent, and Tom rushes to him.'For God's sake, Carl, what's wrong?'Carl brushes him aside and makes for the telephone.'Is he--dead?' Tom puts the question huskily and fearfully.Carl pays no attention except: 'Please don't bother me now, Tom. Thisis too serious.' Then he calls on the telephone for the coroner. Thishas such an effect on Geraghty that Knoblock comes forth from thebedroom to pacify him.'I am sure it will be all right,' Knoblock says to Tom, at the sametime looking as though he were trying to keep something secret.Everything is staged perfectly and poor old Tom just stands and looksbewildered, and every few moments tries to break into the bedroom, butis told to stay out, that he is in no condition to be mixing up inanything so serious.The chief of police is called, doctors are urged to rush there in allhaste with motors, and with each call Tom's suffering increases. Wekeep up the joke until it has reached the point of artistry, and thenI enter from the bedroom in a flowing sheet for a gown and a pillowslip on each arm to represent wings, and I proceed to be an angel fora moment.But the effect has been too great on Tom, and even the travesty at thefinish does not get a laugh from him.We laughed and talked about the stunt for a while and Tom was askedwhat he would have done if it had been true and I had been hit by thelightning.Tom made me feel very cheap and sorry that I had played the trick onhim when he said that he would have jumped out of the window himself,as he would have no desire to live if I were dead.But we soon got away from serious things and ended the party merrilyand went home about five in the morning. Which meant that we wouldsleep very late that day.Three o'clock in the afternoon found me awakened by the news thatthere was a delegation of reporters waiting to see me. They were allushered in and the whole thirty-five of them started firing questionsat me in a bunch. And I answered them all, for by this time I wasquite proficient with reporters, and as they all asked the samequestions that I had answered before it was not hard.In fact, we all had luncheon or tea together, though for me it wasbreakfast, and I enjoyed them immensely. They are real, sincere, andintelligent and not hero worshippers.Along about five o'clock Ed. Knoblock came in with the suggestion thatwe go out for a ride together and call around to see Bernard Shaw.This did sound like a real treat. Knoblock knows Shaw very well and hefelt sure that Shaw and I would like each other.First, though, I propose that we take a ride about London, and Ed.leads the way to some very interesting spots, the spots that thetourist rarely sees as he races his way through the buildings listedin guide books.He takes me to the back of the Strand Theatre, where there arebeautiful gardens and courts suggesting palaces and armour and thedays when knights were bold. These houses were the homes of privatepeople during the reign of King Charles and even farther back. Theyabound in secret passages and tunnels leading up to the royal palace.There is an air about them that is aped and copied, but it is not hardto distinguish the real from the imitation. History is written onevery stone; not the history of the battlefield that is laid bare forthe historians, but that more intimate history, that of thedrawing-room, where, after all, the real ashes of empires are sifted.Now we are in Adelphi Terrace, where Bernard Shaw and Sir James Barrielive. What a lovely place the terrace is! And its arches underneathleading to the river. And at this hour, six-thirty, there comes thefirst fall of evening and London with its soft light is at its best.I can quite understand why Whistler was so crazy about it. Itslighting is perfect--so beautiful and soft. Perhaps there are thosewho complain that it is poorly lighted and who would install manymodern torches of electricity to remedy the defect, but give me Londonas it is. Do not paint the lily.We make for Shaw's house, which overlooks the Thames Embankment. As weapproach I feel that this is a momentous occasion. I am to meet Shaw.We reach the house. I notice on the door a little brass name platewith the inscription, 'Bernard Shaw.' I wonder if there is anythingsignificant about Shaw's name being engraved in brass. The thoughtpleases me. But we are here, and Knoblock is about to lift theknocker.And then I seem to remember reading somewhere about dozens of movieactors going abroad, and how they invariably visited Shaw. Good Lord!the man must be weary of them. And why should he be singled out andimposed upon? And I do not desire to ape others. And I want to beindividual and different. And I want Bernard Shaw to like me. And Idon't want to force myself upon him.And all this is occurring very rapidly, and I am getting fussed, andwe are almost before him, and I say to Knoblock, 'No, I don't want tomeet him.'Ed. is annoyed and surprised and thinks I am crazy and everything. Heasks why, and I suddenly become embarrassed and shy. 'Some othertime,' I beg. 'We won't call to-day.' I don't know why, but suddenly Ifeel self-conscious and silly--Would I care to see Barrie? He lives just across the road.'No, I don't want to see any of them to-day.' I am too tired. I findthat it would be too much effort.So I go home, after drinking in all the beauties of the evening, thetwilight, and the loveliness of Adelphi Terrace. This requires noeffort. I can just drift along on my own, let thoughts come and go asthey will, and never have to think about being polite and wondering ifI am holding my own in intelligent discussion that is sure to arisewhen one meets great minds. I wasted the evening just then. Some othertime, I know, I am going to want Shaw and Barrie.I drift along with the sight and am carried back a hundred years, twohundred, a thousand. I seem to see the ghosts of King Charles andothers of Old England with the tombstones epitaphed in Old English anddating back even to the eleventh century.It is all fragrant and too fleeting. We must get back to the hotel todress for dinner.Then Knoblock, Sonny, Geraghty, and a few others dine with me at theEmbassy Club, but Knoblock, who is tired, leaves after dinner. Alongabout ten o'clock Sonny, Geraghty, Donald Crist, Carl Robinson, andmyself decide to take a ride. We make toward Lambeth. I want to showthem Lambeth. I feel as if it is mine--a choice discovery andpossession that I wish to display.I recall an old photographer's shop in the Westminster Bridge Roadjust before you come to the bridge. I want to see it again. We get outthere. I remember having seen a picture framed in that window when Iwas a boy--a picture of Dan Leno, who was an idol of mine in thosedays.The picture was still there, so is the photographer--the name 'Sharp'is still on the shop. I tell my friends that I had my picture takenhere about fifteen years ago, and we went inside to see if we couldget one of the photos.'My name is Chaplin,' I told the person behind the counter. 'Youphotographed me fifteen years ago. I want to buy some copies.''Oh, we destroyed the negative long ago,' the person behind thecounter thus dismisses me.'Have you destroyed Mr. Leno's negative?' I ask him.'No,' was the reply, 'but Mr. Leno is a famous comedian.'Such is fame. Here I had been patting myself on the back, thinking Iwas some pumpkins as a comedian, and my negative destroyed. However,there is balm in Gilead. I tell him I am Charlie Chaplin and he wantsto turn the place upside down to get some new pictures of me; but wehaven't the time, and, besides, I want to get out, because I amhearing suppressed snickers from my friends, before whom I was goingto show off.VII
INFP	A MEMORABLE NIGHT IN LONDONSo we wandered along through South London by Kennington Cross andKennington Gate, Newington Butts, Lambeth Walk, and the Clapham Road,and all through the neighbourhood. Almost every step brought backmemories, most of them of a tender sort. I was right here in the midstof my youth, but somehow I seemed apart from it. I felt as though Iwas viewing it under a glass. It could be seen all too plainly, butwhen I reached to touch it it was not there--only the glass could befelt, this glass that had been glazed by the years since I left.If I could only get through the glass and touch the real live thingthat had called me back to London. But I couldn't.A man cannot go back. He thinks he can, but other things have happenedto his life. He has new ideas, new friends, new attachments. Hedoesn't belong to his past, except that the past has, perhaps, mademarks on him.My friends and I continue our stroll--a stroll so pregnant withinterest to me at times that I forget that I have company and wanderalong alone.Who is that old derelict there against the cart? Another landmark. Ilook at him closely. He is the same--only more so. Well do I rememberhim, the old tomato man. I was about twelve when I first saw him, andhe is still here in the same old spot, plying the same old trade,while I--I can picture him as he first appeared to me standing beside his roundcart heaped with tomatoes, his greasy clothes shiny in theirunkemptness, the rather glassy single eye that had looked from oneside of his face staring at nothing in particular, but giving you thefeeling that it was seeing all, the bottled nose with the network ofveins spelling dissipation.I remember how I used to stand around and wait for him to shout hiswares. His method never varied. There was a sudden twitchingconvulsion, and he leaned to one side, trying to straighten out theother as he did so, and then, taking into his one good lung all theair it would stand, he would let forth a clattering, gargling,asthmatic, high-pitched wheeze, a series of sounds which defiedinterpretation.Somewhere in the explosion there could be detected 'ripe tomatoes.'Any other part of his message was lost.And he was still here. Through summer suns and winter snows he hadstood and was standing. Only a bit more decrepit, a bit older, moredyspeptic, his clothes greasier, his shoulder rounder, his one eyerather filmy and not so all-seeing as it once was. And I waited. Buthe did not shout his wares any more. Even the good lung was failing.He just stood there inert in his ageing. And somehow the tomatoes didnot look so good as they once were.We get into a cab and drive back towards Brixton to the Elephant andCastle, where we pull up at a coffee store. The same old London coffeestore, with its bad coffee and tea.There are a few pink-cheeked roues around and a couple of oldderelicts. Then there are a lot of painted ladies, many of them withyoung men and the rest of them looking for young men. Some of theyoung fellows are minus arms and many of them carry various ribbons ofmilitary honour. They are living and eloquent evidence of the War andits effects. There are a number of stragglers. The whole scene to meis depressing. What a sad London this is! People with tired, wornfaces after four years of War!Someone suggests that we go up and see George Fitzmaurice, who livesin Park Lane. There we can get a drink and then go to bed. We jump ina cab and are soon there. What a difference! Park Lane is anotherworld after the Elephant and Castle. Here are the homes of themillionaires and the prosperous.Fitzmaurice is quite a successful moving-picture director. We find alot of friends at his house, and over whiskies-and-sodas we discussour trip. Our trip through Kennington suggests Limehouse, andconversation turns toward that district and Thomas Burke.I get their impressions of Limehouse. It is not as tough as it hasbeen pictured. I rather lost my temper through the discussion.One of those in the party, an actor, spoke very sneeringly of thatromantic district and its people.'Talk about Limehouse nights. I thought they were tough down there.Why, they are like a lot of larks!' said this big-muscled leading man.And then he tells of a visit to the Limehouse district--a visit madesolely for the purpose of finding trouble. How he had read of thetough characters there and how he had decided to go down to find outhow tough they were.'I went right down there into their joints,' he said, 'and told themthat I was looking for somebody that was tough, the tougher thebetter, and I went up to a big mandarin wearing a feather and said:'Give me the toughest you've got. You fellows are supposed to be toughdown here, so let's see how tough you are.' And I couldn't get a riseout of any of them,' he concluded.This was enough for me. It annoyed.I told him that it was very fine for well-fed, over-paid actorsflaunting toughness at these deprived people, who are gentle and niceand, if ever tough, only so because of environment. I asked him justhow tough he would be if he were living the life that some of theseunfortunate families must live. How easy for him, with five meals aday beneath that thrust-out chest with his muscles trained andperfect, trying to start something with these people. Of course theywere not tough, but when it comes to four years of War, when it comesto losing an arm or a leg, then they are tough. But they are not goingaround looking for fights unless there is a reason.It rather broke up the party, but I was feeling so disgusted that Idid not care.We meander along, walking from Park Lane to the Ritz.On our way we are stopped by two or three young girls. They arestamped plainly and there is no subtlety about their 'Hello boys! Youare not going home so early?' They salute us. We wait a moment. Theypause and then wave their hands to us and we beckon them.'How is it you are up so late?' They are plainly embarrassed at thisquestion. Perhaps it has been a long time since they were given thebenefit of the doubt. They are not sure just what to say. We aredifferent. Their usual method of attack or caress does not seem inorder, so they just giggle.Here is life in its elemental rawness. I feel very kindly disposedtoward them, particularly after my bout with the well-fed actor whogot his entertainment from the frailties of others. But it is ratherhard for us to mix. There is a rather awkward silence.Then one of the girls asks if we have a cigarette. Robinson gives thema package, which they share between the three of them. This breaks theice. They feel easier. The meeting is beginning to run along theparliamentary rules that they know.Do we know where they can get a drink?'No.' This is a temporary setback, but they ask if we mind theirwalking along a bit with us. We don't, and we walk along towards theRitz. They are giggling, and before long I am recognised. They areembarrassed.They look down at their shabby little feet where ill-fitting shoes runover at the heels. Their cheap little cotton suits class them even lowin their profession, though their youth is a big factor toward theirpotential rise when they have become hardened and their mentalfaculties have become sharpened in their eternal battles with men.Then men will come to them.Knowing my identity, they are on their good behaviour. No longer arewe prospects. We are true adventure for them this night. Theirintimacy has left them and in its place there appears a reserve whichis attractive even in its awkwardness.The conversation becomes somewhat formal. And we are nearing thehotel, where we must leave them. They are very nice and charming now,and are as timid and reserved as though they had just left a convent.They talk haltingly of the pictures they have seen, shyly telling howthey loved me in 'Shoulder Arms,' while one of them told how she weptwhen she saw 'The Kid' and how she had that night sent some money hometo a little kid brother who was in school and staying there throughher efforts in London.The difference in them seems so marked when they call me Mr. Chaplinand I recall how they had hailed us as 'Hello, boys.' Somehow I ratherresent the change. I wish they would be more intimate in theirconversation. I would like to get their viewpoint. I want to talk tothem freely. They are so much more interesting than most of the peopleI meet.But there is a barrier. Their reserve stays. I told them that I wassure they were tired and gave them cab fare.One of their number speaks for the trio.'Thanks, Mr. Chaplin, very much. I could do with this, really. I wasbroke, honest. Really, this comes in very handy.'They could not quite understand our being nice and sympathetic.They were used to being treated in the jocular way of streetcomradery. Finer qualities came forward under the respectful attentionwe gave them, something rather nice that had been buried beneath theveneer of their trade.Their thanks are profuse, yet awkward. They are not used to givingthanks. They usually pay, and pay dearly, for anything handed them. Webid them 'good night.' They smile and walk away.We watch them for a bit as they go on their way. At first they arestrolling along, chattering about their adventure. Then, as if on asignal, they straighten up as though bracing themselves, and withquickened steps they move toward Piccadilly, where a haze of light isreflected against the murky sky.It is the beacon light from their battleground, and as we follow themwith our eyes these butterflies of the night make for the lights wherethere is laughter and gaiety.As we go along to the Ritz we are all sobered by the encounter withthe three little girls. I think blessed is the ignorance that enablesthem to go on without the mental torture that would come from knowingthe inevitable that awaits them.As we go up the steps of the hotel we see a number of derelictshuddled asleep against the outside of the building, sitting under thearches and doors, men and women, old and young, underfed, deprived,helpless, so much so that the imprint of helplessness is woven intotheir brain and brings on an unconsciousness that is a blessing.We wake them up and hand them each money. 'Here, get yourself a bed.'They are too numbed. They thank us mechanically, accepting what wegive them, but their reaction and thanks are more physical thanmental.There was one old woman about seventy. I gave her something. She wokeup, or stirred in her sleep, took the money without a word ofthanks--took it as though it was her ration from the bread line and nothanks were expected, huddled herself up in a tighter knot thanbefore, and continued her slumber. The inertia of poverty had longsince claimed her.We rang the night bell at the Ritz, for they are not like our Americanhotels, where guests are in the habit of coming in at all hours of thenight. The Ritz closes its doors at midnight, and after that hour youmust ring them.But the night was not quite over. As we were ringing the bell wenoticed a waggon a little way off in the street, with the horseslipping and the driver out behind the waggon with his shoulder to thewheel and urging the horse along with cheery words.We walked to the waggon and found it was loaded with apples and on itsway to the market. The streets were so slippery that the horse couldnot negotiate the hill. I could not help but think how different fromthe usual driver this man was.He did not belay the tired animal with a whip and curse and swear athim in his helplessness. He saw that the animal was up against it, andinstead of beating him he got out and put his shoulder to the wheel,never for the moment doubting that the horse was doing his best.We all went out into the street and put our shoulders against thewaggon along with the driver. He thanked us, and as we finally got themomentum necessary to carry it over the hill he said:'These darn roads are so slippery that the darned horse even can'tpull it.'It was a source of wonder to him that he should come upon somethingtoo much for his horse. And the horse was so well fed and well kept. Icould not help but notice how much better the animal looked than hismaster. The evening was over. I don't know but that the incident ofthe apple waggon was a fitting finale.The next morning for the first time I am made to give my attention tothe mail that has been arriving. We have been obliged to have anotherroom added to our suite in order to have some place in which to keepthe numerous sacks that are being brought to us at all hours.The pile is becoming so mountainous that we are compelled to engagehalf a dozen stenographers just for the purpose of reading andclassifying them.We found that there were 73,000 letters or cards addressed to meduring the first three days in London, and of this number more than28,000 were begging letters--letters begging anywhere from L1 toL100,000.Countless and varied were the reasons set forth. Some were ridiculous.Some were amusing. Some were pathetic. Some were insulting. All ofthem in earnest.I discovered from the mail that there are 671 relatives of mine inEngland that I knew nothing about.The greater part of these were cousins, and they gave very detailedfamily-tree tracings in support of their claims. All of them wished tobe set up in business or to get into the movies.But the cousins did not have a monopoly on the relationships. Therewere brothers and sisters and aunts and uncles, and there were nineclaiming to be my mother, telling wondrous adventure stories about mybeing stolen by gipsies when a baby or being left on doorsteps, untilI began to think my youth had been a very hectic affair. But I did notworry much about these last, as I had left a perfectly good motherback in California, and so far I have been pretty much satisfied withher.There were letters addressed just to Charles Chaplin, some to KingCharles, some to the 'King of Mirth'; on some there was drawn thepicture of a battered derby; some carried a reproduction of my shoesand cane; and in some there was stuck a white feather with thequestion as to what I was doing during the war?Would I visit such and such institutions? Would I appear for such andsuch charity? Would I kick off the football season or attend someparticular Soccer game? Then there were letters of welcome and oneenclosing an iron cross inscribed, 'For your services in the GreatWar,' and 'Where were you when England was fighting?'Then there were others thanking me for happiness given the senders.These came by the thousand. One young soldier sent me four medals hehad gotten during the big war. He said that he was sending thembecause I had never been properly recognised. His part was so smalland mine so big, he said, that he wanted me to have his _Croix deGuerre_, his regimental and other medals.Some of the letters were most interesting. Here are a few samples:     DEAR MR. CHAPLIN,--You are a leader in your line and I am a     leader in mine. Your speciality is moving pictures and custard     pies. My speciality is windmills.     I know more about windmills than any man in the world. I have     studied the winds all over the world and am now in a position     to invent a windmill that will be the standard mill of the     world, and it will be made so it can be adapted to the winds of     the tropics and the winds of the arctic regions.     I am going to let you in on this in an advantageous way. You     have only to furnish the money. I have the brains, and in a few     years I will make you rich and famous. You had better 'phone me     for quick action.     DEAR MR. CHAPLIN,--Won't you please let me have enough money to     send little Oscar to college? Little Oscar is twelve, and the     neighbours all say that he is the brightest little boy they     have ever seen. And he can imitate you so well that we don't     have to go to the movies any more. [This is dangerous. Oscar is     a real competitor, ruining my business.] And so, if you can't     send the little fellow to college, won't you take him in the     movies with you like you did Jackie Coogan?     DEAR MR. CHAPLIN,--My brother is a sailor, and he is the only     man in the world who knows where Capt. Kidd's gold is buried.     He has charts and maps and everything necessary, including a     pick and shovel. But he cannot pay for the boat.     Will you pay for the boat, and half the gold is yours? All you     need do is to say 'yes' to me in a letter, and I will go out     and look for John as he is off somewhere on a bust, being what     you might call a drinking man when ashore. But I am sure that I     can find him, as he and I drink in the same places. Your     shipmate.     DEAR CHARLIE,--Have you ever thought of the money to be made in     peanuts? I know the peanut industry, but I am not telling any     of my business in a letter. If you are interested in becoming a     peanut king, then I'm your man. Just address me as Snapper     Dodge, above address.     DEAR MR. CHAPLIN,--My daughter has been helping me about my     boarding-house now for several years, and I may say that she     understands the art of catering to the public as wishes to stay     in quarters. But she has such high-toned ideas, like as putting     up curtains in the bathroom and such that at times I think she     is too good for the boarding-house business and should be     having her own hotel to run.     If you could see your way to buy a hotel in London or New York     for Drusilla, I am sure that before long your name and     Drusilla's would be linked together all over the world because     of what Drusilla would do to the hotel business. And she would     save money because she could make all the beds and cook     herself, and at nights could invent the touches like what I     have mentioned. Drusilla is waiting for you to call her.     DEAR MR. CHAPLIN,--I am enclosing pawn tickets for Grandma's     false teeth and our silver water pitcher, also a rent bill     showing that our rent was due yesterday. Of course, we would     rather have you pay our rent first, but if you could spare it,     grandma's teeth would be acceptable, and we can't hold our     heads up among the neighbours since father sneaked our silver     pitcher to get some beer.IX.I MEET THE IMMORTALSHere are extracts from a number of letters selected at random from themountain of mail awaiting me at the hotel:'---- wishes Mr. Chaplin a hearty welcome and begs him to give him thehonour of shaving him on Sunday, Sept. 11, any time which he thinkssuitable.'A West End moneylender has forwarded his business card, which states:'Should you require temporary cash accommodation, I am prepared toadvance you L50 to L10,000 on note of hand alone, without fees ordelay. All communications strictly private and confidential.'A man living in Golden Square, W., writes: 'My son, in the endeavourto get a flower thrown by you from the Ritz Hotel, lost his hat, thebill for which I enclose, seven shillings and sixpence.'A Liverpool scalp specialist gathers that Mr. Chaplin is muchconcerned regarding the appearance of grey hairs in his head. 'I claimto be,' he adds, 'the only man in Great Britain who can and doesrestore the colour of grey hair. You may visit Liverpool, and if youwill call I shall be pleased to examine your scalp and give you acandid opinion. If nothing can be done I will state so frankly.''Is there any chance,' writes a woman of Brixton, 'of you requiringfor your films the services of twin small boys nearly four years oldand nearly indistinguishable? An American agent has recently been inthis neighbourhood and secured a contract with two such small girls(twins), which points to at least a demand for such on Americanfilms.'A widow of sixty-two writes: 'I have a half-dozen china teaset of thelate Queen Victoria's diamond jubilee, and it occurred to me that youmight like to possess it. If you would call or allow me to take itanywhere for you to see, I would gladly do so. I have had ittwenty-four years, and would like to raise money on it.'A South London picture dealer writes: 'If ever you should be passingthis way when you are taking your quiet strolls around London, I wouldlike you to drop in and see a picture that I think might interest you.It is the Strand by night, painted by Arthur Grimshaw in 1887. I hopeyou won't think I have taken too much of a liberty--but I knew yourmother when I was in Kate Paradise's troupe, and I think she wouldremember me if ever you were to mention Clara Symonds of that troupe.It is a little link with the past.''DEAR OLD FRIEND,--Some months ago I wrote to you, and no doubt youwill remember me. I was in 'Casey's Court,' and, as you know, we hadMr. Murray for our boss. You have indeed got on well. I myself haveonly this month come home from being in Turkey for eight years. Dearold boy, I should like to see you when you come to London--that is, ifyou do not mind mixing with one of the Casey's Court urchins.'A Sussex mother writes: 'Would you grant a few moments' interview to alittle girl of nine (small for her years) whom I am anxious to starton the films? She has much in her favour, being not only bright andclever, but unusually attractive in appearance, receiving unlimitedattention wherever she goes, as she is really quite out of theordinary.'A disengaged actress writes: 'If you should take a film in England itwould be a great kindness to employ some of the hundreds of actressesout of work now and with no prospects of getting any. A walk-on wouldbe a very welcome change to many of us, to say nothing of a part.'A Somerset man writes: 'A friend of mine has a very old-time spotright here in Somerset, with the peacocks wandering across thewell-kept grounds and three lovely trout ponds, where last night Ibrought home five very fine rainbow trout each weighing aboutone-and-a-half pounds. You will be tired of the crowds. Slip away downto me and I will give you ten days or more of the best time you canget. There will be no side or style, and your oldest clothes will bethe thing.'Another correspondent says: 'My husband and I should consider it anhonour if during your visit to South London you would call and take ahomely cup of tea with us. I read in the paper of your intention tostay at an old-fashioned inn, and should like to recommend the WhiteHorse Inn at Sheen, which, I believe, is the oldest in Surrey. Itcertainly corresponds with your ideal. Welcome to your home town.'This from the seaside: 'When you are really tired of the rush ofLondon there is a very nice little place called Seaford, not very farfrom London, just a small place where you can have a real rest. Nodressing up, etc., and then fishing, golf, and tennis if you care forthe same. You could put up at an hotel or here. There will be no oneto worry you. Don't forget to drop us a line.'A London clubman, in offering hospitality, says: 'I do not know you.You do not know me, and probably don't want to. But just think it overand come and have a bit of lunch with me one day. This betweenourselves--no publicity.''Saint Pancras Municipal Officers' Swimming Club would be greatlyhonoured by your presiding at our annual swimming gala to be held atthe St. Pancras Public Baths.'Dorothy, writing from Poplar, asks: 'Dear Mr. Charlie Chaplin, if youhave a pair of old boots at home will you throw them at me for luck?'An aspirant for the position of secretary writes: 'I am a musicalcomedy artist by profession, but am at present out of work. I am sixfeet two inches in height and 27 years of age. If there is anycapacity in which you can use my services I shall be very thankful.Hoping you will have an enjoyable stay in your home country.'A Barnes man writes: 'If you have time we should be very proud if youcould spare an afternoon to come to tea. We should love to give you areal old-fashioned Scotch tea, if you would care to come. We know youwill be feted, and everyone will want you, but if you feel tired andwant a wee rest come out quietly to us. If it wasn't for your dearfunny ways on the screen during the war we would all have gone under.''Dear Charles,' writes an eleven-year-old, 'I'd like to meet you very,very much. I'd like to meet you just to say thank you for all thetimes you've cheered me up when I've felt down and miserable. I'venever met you and I don't suppose I ever will, but you will always bemy friend and helper. I'd love your photograph signed by you! Are youlikely to come to Harrogate? I wish you would. Perhaps you could comeand see me. Couldn't you try?'I wish I could read them all, for in every one there is human feeling,and I wish it were possible that I could accept some of theinvitations, especially those inviting me to quietness and solitude.But there are thousands too many. Most of them will have to beanswered by my secretaries, but all of them will be answered, and weare taking trunkfuls of the letters back to California in order thatas many of the requests as possible shall receive attention.During the afternoon there came Donald Crisp, Tom Geraghty and thebunch, and before long my apartment in the London Ritz might just aswell be home in Los Angeles. I realise that I am getting nowhere,meeting nobody and still playing in Hollywood.I have travelled 6,000 miles and find I have not shaken the dust ofHollywood from my shoes. I resent this. I tell Knoblock I must meetother people besides Geraghty and the Hollywood bunch. I have seen asmuch as I want to see of it. Now I want to meet people.Knoblock smiles, but he is too kind to remind me of my retreat beforethe name plate of Bernard Shaw. He and I go shopping and I am measuredfor some clothes; then to lunch with E. V. Lucas.Lucas is a very charming man, sympathetic and sincere. He has writtena number of very good books. It is arranged to give me a party thatnight at the Garrick Club.After luncheon we visit Stoll's Theatre, where 'Shoulder Arms' andMary Pickford's picture 'Suds,' are being shown. This is my firstexperience in an English cinema. The opera house is one that was builtby Steinhouse and then turned into a movie theatre.It is strange and odd to see the English audience drinking tea andeating pastry while watching the performance. I find very littledifference in their appreciation of the picture. All the pointstell just the same as in America. I get out without being recognisedand am very thankful for that.  [Illustration: Another scene from 'Sunnyside,' one of my favourite   photo plays.]Back to the hotel and rest for the evening before my dinner at theGarrick Club.The thought of dining at the Garrick Club brought up before me themental picture that I have always carried of that famous old meetingplace in London, where Art is most dignified. And the club itselfrealised my picture to the fullest.Tradition and custom are so deep-rooted there that I believe itsroutine would go on through sheer mechanics of spirit, even if itsvarious employees should forget to show up some day. The corners seemalmost peopled with the ghosts of Henry Irving and his comrades. Therein one end of the gloomy old room is a chair in which David Garrickhimself sat.All those at the dinner were well known in art circles--E. V. Lucas,Walter Hackett, George Frampton, J. M. Barrie, Herbert Hammil, EdwardKnoblock, Harry Graham, N. Nicholas, Nicholas D. Davies, SquireBancroft, and a number of others whose names I do not remember.What an interesting character is Squire Bancroft. I am told that he isEngland's oldest living actor, and he is now retired. He does not lookas though he should retire.I am late and that adds to an embarrassment which started as soon as Iknew I was to meet Barrie and so many other famous people.There is Barrie. He is pointed out to me just about the time Irecognise him myself. This is my primary reason for coming. To meetBarrie. He is a small man, with a dark moustache and a deeply marked,sad face, with heavily shadowed eyes; but I detect lines of humourlurking around his mouth. Cynical? Not exactly.I catch his eye and make motions for us to sit together, and then findthat the party had been planned that way anyhow. There is theinevitable hush for introductions. How I hate it. Names are the baneof my existence. Personalities, that's the thing.But everyone seems jovial except Barrie. His eyes look sad and tired.But he brightens as though all along there had been that hidden smilebehind the mask. I wonder if they are all friendly toward me, or if Iam just the curiosity of the moment.There is an embarrassing pause, after we have filed into thedining-room, which E. V. Lucas breaks.'Gentlemen, be seated.'I felt almost like a minstrel man and the guests took their seats assimultaneously as though rehearsed for it.I feel very uncomfortable mentally. I cough. What shall I say toBarrie? Why hadn't I given it some thought? I am aware that SquireBancroft is seated at my other side. I feel as though I am in a vicewith its jaws closing as the clock ticks. Why did I come? Theatmosphere is so heavy, yet I am sure they feel most hospitable towardme.I steal a glance at Squire Bancroft. He looks every bit the eminentold-school actor. The dignity and tradition of the English stage iswritten into every line in his face. I remember Nicholson having saidthat the squire would not go to a 'movie,' that he regarded his standas a principle. Then why is he here? He is going to be difficult, Ifear.He breaks the ice with the announcement that he had been to a moviethat day! Coming from him it was almost a shock.'Mr. Chaplin, the reading of the letter in 'Shoulder Arms' was thehigh spot of the picture.' This serious consideration from the man whowould not go to the movies.I wanted to hug him. Then I learn that he had told everyone not to sayanything about his not having been to a movie for fear that it wouldoffend me. He leans over and whispers his age and tells me he is theoldest member of the club. He doesn't look within ten years of hisage. I find myself muttering inanities in answering him.Then Barrie tells me that he is looking for some one to play Peter Panand says he wants me to play it. He bowls me over completely. To thinkthat I was avoiding and afraid to meet such a man! But I am afraid todiscuss it with him seriously, am on my guard because he may decidethat I know nothing about it and change his mind.Just imagine, Barrie has asked me to play Peter Pan! It is too big andgrand to risk spoiling it by some chance witless observation, so Ichange the subject and let this golden opportunity pass. I have failedcompletely in my first skirmish with Barrie.There are laboured jokes going the rounds of the table and everyoneseems to feel conscious of some duty that is resting on his shouldersungracefully.One ruddy gentleman whose occupation is a most serious one, I am told,that of building a giant memorial in Whitehall to the dead of the lateWar, is reacting to the situation most flippantly. His conversation,which has risen to a pitch of almost hysterical volume, is mostridiculously comic. He is a delightful buffoon.Everyone is laughing at his chatter, but nothing seems to bepenetrating my stupidity, though I am carrying with me a widemechanical grin, which I broaden and narrow with the nuances of thetable laughing. I feel utterly out of the picture, that I don'tbelong, that there must be something significant in the badinage thatis bandied about the board.Barrie is speaking again about moving pictures. I must understand. Isummon all of my scattered faculties to bear upon what he is saying.What a peculiarly shaped head he has.He is speaking of 'The Kid,' and I feel that he is trying to flatterme. But how he does it! He is criticising the picture.He is very severe. He declares that the 'heaven' scene was entirelyunnecessary, and why did I give it so much attention? And why so muchof the mother in the picture, and why the meeting of the mother andthe father? All of these things he is discussing analytically andprofoundly, so much so that I find that my feeling of self-consciousnessis rapidly leaving me.I find myself giving my side of the argument without hesitation,because I am not so sure that Barrie is right, and I had reasons, goodreasons, for wanting all those things in the picture. But I amthrilled at his interest and appreciation and it is borne in upon methat by discussing dramatic construction with me he is paying a verygracious and subtle compliment. It is sweet of him. It relieves me ofthe last vestige of my embarrassment.'But, Sir James,' I am saying, 'I cannot agree with you--' Imagine themetamorphosis. And our discussion continues easily and pleasantly. Iam aware of his age as he talks and I get more of his spirit ofwhimsicality.The food is being served and I find that E. V. Lucas has provided atreacle pudding, a particular weakness of mine, to which I do justice.I am wondering if Barrie resents age, he who is so youthful in spirit.There seems to be lots of fun in the general buffoonery that is goingon around the table, but despite all efforts to the contrary I amserving a diet of silence. I feel very colourless, that the wholeconversation that is being shouted is colourless.I am a good audience. I laugh at anything and dare not speak. Whycan't I be witty? Are they trying to draw me out? Maybe I am wrong andthere is a purpose behind this buffoonery. But I hardly know whetherto retaliate in kind, or just grin.I am dying for something to happen. Lucas is rising. We all feel thetension. Why are parties like that? It ends.Barrie is whispering, 'Let's go to my apartment for a drink and aquiet talk,' and I begin to feel that things are most worth while.Knoblock and I walk with him to Adelphi Terrace, where his apartmentoverlooks the Thames Embankment.Somehow this apartment seems just like him, but I cannot convey theresemblance in a description of it. The first thing you see is awriting desk in a huge room beautifully furnished, and with dark-woodpanelling. Simplicity and comfort are written everywhere. There is alarge Dutch fireplace in the right side of the room, but theoutstanding piece of furniture is a tiny kitchen stove in one corner.It is polished to such a point that it takes the aspect of theornamental rather than the useful. He explains that on this he makeshis tea when servants are away. Such a touch, perhaps, just the touchto suggest Barrie.Our talk drifts to the movies and Barrie tells me of the plans forfilming 'Peter Pan.' We are on very friendly ground in this discussionand I find myself giving Barrie ideas for plays while he is giving meideas for movies, many of them suggestions that I can use in comedies.There is a knock at the door. Gerald du Maurier is calling. He is oneof England's greatest actors and the son of the man who wrote'Trilby.' Our party lasts far into the night, until about three in themorning. I notice that Barrie looks rather tired and worn, so weleave, walking with Du Maurier up the Strand. He tells us that Barrieis not himself since his nephew was drowned, that he has agedconsiderably.We walk slowly back to the hotel and to bed.Next day there is a card from Bruce Bairnsfather, England's famouscartoonist, whose work during the war brought him internationalsuccess, inviting me to tea. He carries me out into the country, whereI have a lovely time. His wife tells me that he is just a bundle ofnerves and that he never knows when to stop working. I ask what H. G.Wells is like and Bruce tells me that he is like 'Wells' and no oneelse.When I get back to the hotel there is a letter from Wells.'Do come over. I've just discovered that you are in town. Do you wantto meet Shaw? He is really very charming out of the limelight. Isuppose you are overwhelmed with invitations, but if there is a chanceto get hold of you for a talk, I will be charmed. How about a week-endwith me at Easton, free from publicity and with harmless, humanpeople. No 'phones in the house.'I lost no time in accepting such an invitation.There is a big luncheon party on among my friends and I am told that aparty has been arranged to go through the Limehouse district withThomas Burke, who wrote 'Limehouse Nights.' I resent it exceedinglyand refuse to go with a crowd to meet Burke. I revolt against theconstant crowding. I hate crowds.London and its experiences are telling on me and I am nervous andunstrung. I must see Burke and go with him alone. He is the one manwho sees London through the same kind of glasses as myself.I am told that Burke will be disappointing because he is so silent,but I do not believe that I will be disappointed in him.Robinson tells the crowd of my feelings and how much I have planned onthis night alone with Burke, and the party is called off. We 'phoneBurke and I make an engagement to meet him at his home that evening atten o'clock. We are to spend the night together in Limehouse. What aprospect!That night I was at Thomas Burke's ahead of time. The prospect of anight spent in the Limehouse district with the author of 'LimehouseNights' was as alluring as Christmas morning to a child.Burke is so different from what I expected. 'Limehouse Nights' had ledme to look for some one physically, as well as mentally, big, though Ihad always pictured him as mild-mannered and tremendously human andsympathetic.I notice even as we are introduced that Burke looks tired and it ishard to think that this little man with the thin, peaked face andsensitive features is the same one who has blazed into literature suchelemental lusts, passions and emotions as characterise his shortstories.I am told that he doesn't give out much. I wonder just who he is like.He is very curious. Doesn't seem to be noticing anything that goes onabout him. He just sits with his arm to his face, leaning on his handand gazing into the fire. As he sits there, apparently unperturbed andindifferent, I am warming up to him considerably. I feel a sort ofmaster of the situation. It's a comfortable feeling. Is the reticencereal or is this some wonderful trick of his, this making his guestfeel superior?His tired-looking, sensitive eyes at first seem rather severe andserious, but suddenly I am aware of something keen, quick andtwinkling in them. His wife has arrived. A very young lady of greatcharm, who makes you feel instantly her artistic capabilities even inordinary conversation.Shortly after his wife comes in Burke and I leave, I feeling very muchthe tourist in the hands of the super city guide.'What, where--anything particular that I want to see?'This rather scares me, but I take it as a challenge and make up mymind that I will know him. He is difficult, and, somehow, I don'tbelieve that he cares for movie actors. Maybe I am only possible'copy' to him?He seems to be doing me a kindness and I find myself feeling ratherstiff and on my best behaviour, but I resolve that before the eveningis through I will make him open up and like me, for I am sure that hisinterest is well worth while.I have nothing to suggest except that we ramble along with nothingdeliberate in view. I feel that this pleases him, for a light ofinterest comes into his eyes, chasing one of responsibility. We arejust going to stroll along.X.I MEET THOMAS BURKE AND H. G. WELLSAs Burke and I ramble along toward no place in particular, I talkabout his book. I have read 'Limehouse Nights' as he wrote it. Thereis nothing I could see half so effective. We discuss the fact thatrealities such as he has kept alive seldom happen in a stroll, but Iam satisfied. I don't want to see. It could not be more beautiful thanthe book. There is no reaction to my flattery. I must watch goodtaste. I feel that he is very intelligent, and I am silent for quite awhile as we stroll toward Stepney. There is a greenish mist hangingabout everything and we seem to be in a labyrinth of narrow alleyways,now turning into streets and then merging into squares. He is silentand we merely walk.And then I awaken. I see his purpose. I can do my own story--he ismerely lending me the tools, and what tools they are! I feel that Ihave served an ample apprenticeship in their use, through merelyreading his stories. I am fortified.It is so easy now. He has given me the stories before. Now he istelling them over in pictures. The very shadows take on life andromance. The skulking, strutting, mincing, hurrying forms that pass usand fade out into the night are now becoming characters. The curtainhas risen on 'Limehouse Nights,' dramatised with the original cast.There is a tang of the east in the air and I am tinglingly aware ofsomething vital, living, moving, in this murky atmosphere that is moreintense even for the occasional dim light that peers out into the softgloom from attic windows and storerooms, or municipal lights thatgleam on the street corners.Here is a little slice of God's fashioning, where love runs hand inhand with death, where poetry sings in withered Mongolian hearts, evenas knives are buried in snow-white breasts and swarthy necks. Herehearts are broken casually, but at the same time there comes just asoften to this lotus land the pity, terror, and wonder of first love,and who shall say which is predominant?Behind each of those tiny garret windows lurks life--life in its mostelemental costume. There is no time, thought, or preparation foranything but the elemental passions, and songs of joy, hope, andlaughter are written into each existence, even as the killings go on,surely, swiftly.There must be a magic wand forever doing a pendulum swing over thisland, for the point of view often changes from the beastly to thebeautiful, and in one short moment the innocent frequently gather thesophistication of the aged. These creatures of life's game runblithely along their course ignorant of the past, joyful in thepresent, and careless of the future, while their tiny lightenedwindows seem to wink deliberately as they make pinpricks of lightthrough the shuttered gloom.On the other side of the street there is stepping a little lady whosecheap cotton clothes are cut with Parisian cunning, and as we crossand pass her we discern beauty, enhanced manyfold by youth andvitality, but hardened with premature knowledge. I can't help butthink of little Gracie Goodnight, the little lady who resented thetouch of a 'Chink,' so much so that she filled the fire extinguishersin his place with oil, and when he was trapped in the blazingbuilding, calmly, and with a baby smile upon her face, poured thecontents of the extinguisher over him and his furniture.There is the Queen's Theatre, bringing forward a mental picture oflittle Gina of Chinatown, who stopped a panic in the fire-frightenedaudience of the playhouse as her debut offering on the stage. LittleGina, who brought the whole neighbourhood to her feet in her joyousdancing delight. Little Gina, who at fourteen had lived, laughed, andloved, and who met death with a smile, carrying the secret of him withher.Every once in a while Burke merely lifts his stick and points. Hisgesture needs no comment. He has located and made clear withoutlanguage the only one object he could possibly mean, and, strangely,it is always something particularly interesting to me. He is mostunusual.What a guide he is! He is not showing me Main Street, not the obvious,not even the sightseer's landmarks, but in this rambling I am gettingthe heart, the soul, the feeling. I feel that he has gauged mequickly--that he knows I love feelings rather than details, that he isunconsciously flattering to my subtlety, after two miles throughblack, though lovely, shadows.Now he is picking the spots where lights are shining from the fishshops. He knows their locations, knows their lights because he hasstudied them well. There are forms slinking gracefully, as though onlocation and with rehearsed movement. What an effect for a camera!This is rugged. Here are the robust of the slums. People act morequickly here than in Lambeth. And suddenly we are back where westarted. In a car we go to the old Britannia, Hoxton, ratherreluctantly.There is a glaring moving-picture palace. What a pity! I resent itsobtrusion. We go along toward the East India Docks--to Shadwell. And Iam feeling creepy with the horror of his stories of Shadwell. I couldhear a child screaming behind a shuttered window and I wondered andimagined, but we did not stop anywhere.We meandered along with just an occasional gesture from him, all thatwas necessary to make his point. To Stanhope Road, Bethnal Green,Spitalfields, Ratcliffe, Soho, Notting Dale, and Camden Town.And through it all I have the feeling that things trivial, portentous,beautiful, sordid, cringing, glorious, simple, epochal, hateful,lovable are happening behind closed doors. I people all those shackswith girls, boys, murders, shrieks, life, beauty.As we go back we talk of life in the world outside this adventurousUtopia. He tells me that he has never been outside of London, not evento Paris. This is very curious to me, but it doesn't seem so as hesays it. He tells me of another book that he has ready and of a playthat he is working on for early production. We talked until three inthe morning and I went back to my hotel with the same sort of feelingsthat I had at twelve when I sat up all night reading Stevenson's'Treasure Island.'The next day I did some shopping, and was measured for boots. Howdifferent is shopping here! A graceful ceremony that is pleasing evento a man. The sole advertisement I see in the shop is 'Patronised byHis Majesty.' It is all said in that one phrase.And the same methods have been in vogue at this bootmaker's forcenturies. My foot is placed on a piece of paper and the outlinedrawn. Then measurements are taken of the instep, ankle, and calf, asI want riding boots. Old-fashioned they will probably continue untilthe end of time, yet somehow I sort of felt that if that old shop hada tongue to put in its cheek, there it would be parked, becausetradition, as an aid to the cash register, is no novelty.In the evening I dined at the Embassy Club with Sonny, and was made anhonorary member of the club.It is amazing how much Europe is aping America, particularly with itsdance music. In cafes you hear all the popular airs that are beingplayed on Broadway. The American influence has been felt to such anextent that King Jazz is a universal potentate. Sonny and I go to thetheatre and see a part of the 'League of Notions,' but we leave earlyand I run to say hello to Constance Collier, who is playing in London.The next day is exciting. Through the invitation of a third party I amto meet H. G. Wells at Stoll's office to view the first showing ofWells's picture, 'Kipps.'In the morning the telephone rings and I hear some one in the parloursay that the Prince of Wales is calling. I get in a blue funk, as doeseveryone else in the apartment, and I hear them rush toward the'phone. But Ed. Knoblock claiming to be versed in the proper method ofhandling such a situation, convinces everyone that he is the one to dothe talking and I relapse back into bed, but wider awake than I everwas in my life.Knoblock on the 'phone:'Are you there? ... Yes ... Oh, yes ... to-night ... Thank you.'Knoblock turning from the 'phone announces, very formally, 'The Princeof Wales wishes Charlie to dine with him to-night,' and he startstoward my bedroom door. (Through all of this I have been in thebedroom, and the others are in the parlour confident, with theconfidence of custom, that I am still asleep.)As Knoblock starts for my bedroom door my very American secretary, inthe very routine voice he has trained for such occurrences, says:'Don't wake him. Tell him to call later. Not before two o'clock.'Knoblock: 'Good God man! This is the Prince of Wales,' and he launchesinto a monologue regarding the traditions of England and the customsof Court and what a momentous occasion this is, contemptuouslyobserving that I am in bed and my secretary wants him to tell thePrince to call later! He cannot get the American viewpoint.Knoblock's sincere indignation wins, and the secretary backs away fromthe bedroom as I plunge under the covers and feign sleep. Knoblockcomes in very dignified and, trying to keep his voice in the mostcasual tone, announces, 'Keep to-night open to dine with the Prince ofWales.'I try to enter into it properly, but I feel rather stiff so early inthe morning. I try to remonstrate with him for having made theengagement. I have another engagement with H. G. Wells, but I amthrilled at the thought of dining with the Prince in BuckinghamPalace. I can't do it. What must I do?Knoblock takes me in hand. He repeats the message. I think some one isspoofing and tell him so. I am very suspicious, and the thrill leavesme as I remember that the Prince is in Scotland, shooting. How couldhe get back?But Knoblock is practical. This must go through. And I think he is abit sore at me for my lack of appreciation. He would go to the palacehimself and find out everything. He goes to the palace to verify.I can't tell his part of it--he was very vague--but I gathered thatwhen he reached there he found all the furniture under covers, and Ican hear that butler now saying:'His Royal Highness the Prince will not be back for several days,sir.'Poor Ed.! It was quite a blow for him, and, on the level, I was a bitdisappointed myself.But I lost no time mooning over my lost chance to dine with royalty,for that afternoon I was going to meet Wells. Going to Stoll's; I waseagerly looking forward to a quiet little party where I could get offsomewhere with Wells and have a long talk.  [Illustration: I meet H. G. Wells.]As I drew near the office, however, I noticed crowds, the same sort ofcrowds that I had been dodging since my exit from Los Angeles. It wasa dense mass of humanity packed around the entire front of thebuilding, waiting for something that had been promised them. And thenI knew that it was an arranged affair and that, so far as a chat wasconcerned, Wells and I were just among those present, even though wewere the guests of honour.I remember keenly the crush in the elevator, a tiny little affairbuilt for about six people and carrying nearer sixty. I get theviewpoint of a sardine quite easily. Upstairs it is not so bad, and Iam swept into a room where there are only a few people and the door isthen closed. I look all around, trying to spot Wells. There he is.I notice his beautiful, dark-blue eyes first. Keen and kindly theyare, twinkling just now as though he were inwardly smiling, perhaps atmy very apparent embarrassment.Before we can get together, however, there comes forward the camerabrigade with its flashlight ammunition. Would we pose together? Wellslooks hopeless. I must show that before cameras I am very much of aperson, and I take the initiative with the lens peepers.We are photoed sitting, standing, hats on and off, and in every otherstereotyped position known to camera men.We sign a number of photos, I in my large, sweeping, sprawling hand--Iremember handling the pen in a dashing, swashbuckling manner--thenWells, in his small, hardly discernible style. I am very conscious ofthis difference, and I feel as though I had started to sing aloudbefore a group of grand-opera stars.Then there is a quick-sketch artist for whom we pose. He does his workrapidly, however, and while he is drawing Wells leans over andwhispers in my ear.'We are the goats,' he tells me. 'I was invited here to meet you andyou were probably invited here to meet me.'He had called the turn perfectly, and when we had both accepted theinvitation our double acceptance had been used to make the showing animportant event. I don't think that Wells liked it.Wells and I go into the dark projection room and I sit with Wells. Ifeel on my mettle almost immediately, sitting at his side, and I feelrather glad that we are spending our first moments in an atmospherewhere I am at home. In his presence I feel critical and analytical andI decide to tell the truth about the picture at all costs. I feel thatWells would do the same thing about one of mine.As the picture is reeling off I whisper to him my likes and dislikes,principally the faulty photography, though occasionally I detect baddirection. Wells remains perfectly silent and I begin to feel that Iam not breaking the ice. It is impossible to get acquainted underthese conditions. Thank God, I can keep silent, because there is thepicture to watch and that saves the day.Then Wells whispers, 'Don't you think the boy is good?'The boy in question is right here on the other side of me, watchinghis first picture. I look at him. Just starting out on a new career,vibrant with ambition, eager to make good, and his first attempt beingshown before such an audience. As I watch he is almost in tears,nervous and anxious.The picture ends. There is a mob clustering about. Directors andofficials look at me. They want my opinion of the picture. I shall betruthful. Shall I criticise? Wells nudges me and whispers, 'Saysomething nice about the boy.' And I look at the boy and see whatWells has already seen and then I say the nice things about him.Wells's kindness and consideration mean so much more than a merepicture.Wells is leaving and we are to meet for dinner, and I am left alone towork my way through the crush to the taxi and back to the hotel, whereI snatch a bit of a nap. I want to be in form for Wells.There comes a little message from him:     Don't forget the dinner. You can wrap up in a cloak if you deem     it advisable, and slip in about 7.30 and we can dine in peace.                                                        H. G. WELLS.                                        Whitehall Court, Entrance 4.We talk of Russia and I find no embarrassment in airing my views, butI soon find myself merely the questioner. Wells talks; and, though hesees with the vision of a dreamer, he brings to his views thepractical. As he talks he appears very much like an American. He seemsvery young and full of 'pep.'There is the general feeling that conditions will right themselves insome way. Organisation is needed, he says, and is just as important asdisarmament. Education is the only salvation, not only of Russia, butof the rest of the world. Socialism of the right sort will comethrough proper education. We discuss my prospects of getting intoRussia. I want to see it. Wells tells me that I am at the wrong timeof the year, that the cold weather coming on would make the trip mostinadvisable.I talk about going to Spain, and he seems surprised to hear that Iwant to see a bull fight. He asks, 'Why?'I don't know, except that there is something so nakedly elementalabout it. There is a picturesque technique about it that must appealto any artist. Perhaps Frank Harris's 'Matador' gave me the impulse,together with my perpetual quest for a new experience. He says it istoo cruel to the horses.I relax as the evening goes on and I find that I am liking him evenmore than I expected. About midnight we go out on a balcony just offhis library, and in the light of a full moon we get a gorgeous view ofLondon. Lying before us in the soft, mellow rays of the moon, Londonlooks as though human, and I feel that we are rather in the PeepingTom _role_.I exclaim, 'The indecent moon.'He picks me up. 'That's good. Where did you get that?'I have to admit that it is not original--that it belongs to Knoblock.Wells comments on my dapperness as he helps me on with my coat. 'I seeyou have a cane with you.' I was also wearing a silk hat. I wonderwhat Los Angeles and Hollywood would say if I paraded there in thiscostume?Wells tries on my hat, then takes my cane and twirls it. The effect isridiculous, especially as just at the moment I notice the two volumesof the 'Outline of History' on his table.Strutting stagily, he chants, 'You're quite the fellow doncher know.'We both laugh. Another virtue for Wells. He's human.I try to explain my dress. Tell him that it is my other self, areaction from the everyday Chaplin. I have always desired to looknatty and I have spurts of primness. Everything about me and my workis so sensational that I must get reaction. My dress is a part of it.I feel that it is a poor explanation of the paradox, but Wells thinksotherwise.He says I notice things. That I am an observer and an analyst. I ampleased. I tell him that the only way I notice things is on the run.Whatever keenness of perception I have is momentary, fleeting. Iobserve all in ten minutes or not at all.What a pleasant evening it is! But as I walk along toward the hotel Ifeel that I have not met Wells yet.And I am going to have another opportunity. I am going to have aweek-end with him at his home in Easton, a week-end with Wells athome, with just his family. That alone is worth the entire trip fromLos Angeles to Europe.X
INFP	OFF TO FRANCEThe hotel next day is teeming with activity.My secretaries are immersed in mail and, despite the assistance of sixgirls whom they have added temporarily to our forces, the mail bagsare piling up and keeping ahead of us.In a fit of generosity or ennui or something I pitch in and help. Itseems to be the most interesting thing I have attempted on the trip.Why didn't I think of it sooner? Here is drama. Here is life inabundance. Each letter I read brings forth new settings, newcharacters, new problems. I find myself picking out many lettersasking for charity. I lay these aside.I have made up my mind to go to France immediately.I call Carl Robinson. I tell him that we are going to France, toParis, at once. Carl is not surprised. He has been with me for a longtime. We decide that we tell nobody and perhaps we can escapeceremonies. We will keep the apartment at the Ritz and keep thestenographers working, so that callers will think that we are hidingabout London somewhere.We are going to leave on Sunday and our plans are perfected inrapid-fire order. We plunge about in a terrible rush as we try toarrange everything at the last minute without giving the appearance ofarranging anything.And in spite of everything, there is a mob at the station to see usoff and autograph books are thrown at me from all sides. I sign for asmany as I can and upon the others I bestow my 'prop' grin. Wonder if Ilook like Doug when I do this?We meet the skipper. What does one ask skippers? Oh yes, how does itlook to-day for crossing? As I ask, I cast my weather eye out into theChannel and it looks decidedly rough for me.But the skipper's 'just a bit choppy' disarms me.I am eager to get on the boat, and the first person I meet is BaronLong, owner of a hotel in San Diego. Good heavens! Can't I ever getaway from Hollywood? I am glad to see him, but not now. He is veryclever, however. He senses the situation, smiles quick 'hellos,' andthen makes himself scarce. In fact, I think he wanted to get awayhimself. Maybe he was as anxious for a holiday as 
INFP	I am approached on the boat by two very charming girls. They want myautograph. Ah, this is nice! I never enjoyed writing my name more.How I wish that I had learned French. I feel hopelessly sunk, becauseafter about three sentences in French I am a total loss so far asconversation is concerned. One girl promises to give me a Frenchlesson. This promises to be a pleasant trip.I am told that in France they call me Charlot. We are by this timestrolling about the boat and bowing every other minute. It is gettingrough and I find myself saying I rather like it that way. Liar.She is speaking. I smile. She smiles. She is talking in French. I amgetting about every eighth word. I cannot seem to concentrate, Frenchis so difficult. Maybe it's the boat.I am dying rapidly. I feel like a dead weight on her arm. I can almostfeel myself get pale as I try to say something, anything. I am weakand perspiring. I blurt out, 'I beg pardon,' and then I rush off to mycabin and lie down. Oh, why did I leave England? Something smellshorrible. I look up. My head is near a new pigskin bag. Yes, that'sit, that awful leathery smell. But I have company. Robinson is in thecabin with me and we are matching ailments.Thus we spent the trip from Dover to Calais and I was as glad to getto the French coast as the Kaiser would have been had he kept thatdinner engagement in Paris.Nearing France, I am almost forgetting my sickness. There is somethingin the atmosphere. Something vibrant. The tempo of life is faster. Thesprings in its mechanism are wound taut. I feel as if I would like totake it apart and look at those springs.I am met by the chief of police, which surprised me, because I wasconfident that I had been canny enough to make a getaway this time.But no. The boat enters the quay and I see the dock crowded withpeople. Some treachery. Hats are waving, kisses are being thrown, andthere are cheers. Cheers that I can only get through the expression,because they are in French and I am notoriously deficient in thatlanguage.'_Vive le Charlot!_' 'Bravo, Charlot!'I am 'Charloted' all over the place. Strange, this foreign tongue.Wonder why a universal language isn't practicable? They are crowdingabout me, asking for autographs. Or at least I think they are, becausethey are pushing books in my face, though for the life of me I can'tmake out a word of their chatter. But I smile. God bless that old'prop' grin, because they seem to like it.Twice I was kissed. I was afraid to look around to see who did it,because I knew I was in France. And you've got to give me the benefitof the doubt. I am hoping that both kisses came from pretty girls,though I do think that at least one of those girls should shave.They examine my signature closely. They seem puzzled. I look. It isspelled right. Oh, I see! They expected 'Charlot.' And I write somemore with 'Charlot.'I am being bundled along to a funny little French train. It seems likea toy. But I am enjoying the difference. Everything is all changed.The new money, the new language, the new faces, the newarchitecture--it's a grown-up three-ring circus to me. The crowd givesa concerted cheer as the train pulls out and a few intrepid ones runalongside until distanced by steam and steel.We go into the dining-room and here is a fresh surprise. The dinner is_table d'hote_ and three waiters are serving it. Everyone is served atonce, and as one man is taking up the soup plates another is servingthe next course. Here is French economy--economy that seems verysensible as they have perfected it. It seems so different fromAmerica, where waiters always seem to be falling over one another indining-rooms. And wines with the meal! And the check; it did notresemble in size the national debt, as dinner checks usually do inAmerica.It has started to rain as we arrive in Paris, which adds to my stateof excitement, and a reportorial avalanche falls upon me. I am aboutovercome. How did reporters know I was coming? The crowd outside thestation is almost as large as the one in London.I am still feeling the effects of my sea-sickness. I am not equal tospeaking nor answering questions. We go to the Customs house and onejournalist, finding us, suggests and points another way out. I amsick. I must disappoint the crowd, and I leap into a taxi and amdriven to Claridge's Hotel.'Out of the frying pan.' Here are more reporters. And they speaknothing but French. The hubbub is awful. We talk to one another. Weshout at one another. We talk slowly. We spell. We do everything tomake Frenchmen understand English, and Englishmen understand French,but it is no use. One of them manages to ask me what I think of Paris.I answer that I never saw so many Frenchmen in my life. I am lookingforward eagerly to meeting Cami, the famous French cartoonist. We havebeen corresponding for several years, he sending me many drawings andI sending him still photos from pictures. We had built up quite afriendship and I have been looking forward to a meeting. I see him.He is coming to me and we are both smiling broadly as we open our armsto each other.'Cami!''Charlot!'Our greeting is most effusive. And then something goes wrong. He istalking in French, a blue streak, with the rapidity of a machine-gun.I can feel my smile fading into blankness. Then I get an inspiration.I start talking in English just as rapidly. Then we both talk at once.It's the old story of the irresistible force and the immovable body.We get nowhere.Then I try talking slowly, extremely slow.'Do--you--understand?'It means nothing. We both realise at the same time what a hopelessthing our interview is. We are sad a bit, then we smile at theabsurdity of it.He is still Cami and I am still Charlot, so we grin and have a goodtime, anyhow.He stays to dinner, which is a hectic meal, for through it all I amtasting this Paris, this Paris that is waiting for me. We go out andto the Folies Bergere. Paris does not seem as light as I expected itto be.And the Folies Bergere seems shabbier. I remember having played hereonce myself with a pantomime act. How grand it looked then. Ratherantiquated now. Somehow it saddened me, this bit of memory that waschased up before me.Next day there is a luncheon with Dudley Field Malone and Waldo Frank.It is a brisk and vivacious meal except when it is broken up by avisit from the American newspaper correspondents.'Mr. Chaplin, why did you come to Europe?''Are you going to Russia?''Did you call on Shaw?'They must have cabled over a set of questions. I went all over thecatechism for them and managed to keep the 'prop' grin at work. Iwouldn't let them spoil Paris for me.We escape after a bit, and back at the hotel I notice an air offormality creeping into the atmosphere as I hear voices in the parlourof my suite. Then my secretary comes in and announces that a veryimportant personage is calling and would speak with me.He enters, an attractive-looking gentleman, and he speaks English.'Mr. Chaplin, that I am to you talk of greetings from the heart of thepeople with France, that you make laugh. Cannot you forego to makeshowing of yourself with charity sometime for devastated France? Onits behalf, I say to you----'I tell him that I will take it up later.He smiles, 'Ah, you are boozy.''Oh, no. I haven't had a drink for several days,' I hasten to informhim. 'I am busy and want to get to bed early to-night.'But Malone butts in with, 'Oh yes, he's very boozy.'And I get a bit indignant until Malone tells me that the Frenchmanmeans 'busy.'Then I am told that there is one young journalist still waiting whohas been here all day, refusing to go until I have seen him.I tell them to bring him in. He comes in smiling in triumph.And he can't speak English.After his hours of waiting we cannot talk.I feel rather sorry for him and we do our best. Finally, with the aidof about everyone in the hotel he manages to ask:--'Do you like France?''Yes,' I answer.He is satisfied.  [Illustration: In Paris with Sir Philip Sassoon and Georges   Carpentier.]Waldo Frank and I sit on a bench in the Champs Elysees and watch thewagons going to market in the early morning. Paris seems mostbeautiful to me just at this time.What a city! What is the force that has made it what it is? Couldanyone conceive such a creation, such a land of continuous gaiety? Itis a masterpiece among cities, the last word in pleasure. Yet I feelthat something has happened to it, something that they are trying tocover by heightened plunges into song and laughter.We stroll along the boulevard and it is growing light. I am recognisedand we are being followed. We are passing a church. There is an oldwoman asleep on the steps, but she does not seem worn and haggard.There is almost a smile on her face as she sleeps. She typifies Paristo me. Hides her poverty behind a smile.Sir Philip Sassoon, who is the confidential secretary to Lloyd George,calls the next day with Georges Carpentier, the pugilistic idol ofFrance, and we are photographed many times, the three of us together,and separately.I am quite surprised that Sir Philip is such a young man. I hadpictured the secretary of Lloyd George as rather a dignified and agedperson. He makes an appointment for me to dine with Lord and LadyRocksavage the next day. Lady Rocksavage is his sister.I also lunch with them the next day, and then to a very fashionablemodiste's for some shopping. This is my first offence of this sort. Imeet Lady Astor, who is shopping there also.It was quite a treat for me, watching the models in this huge,elaborate institution that was really a palace in appointments. Infact, it greatly resembled the palace at Versailles.I felt very meek when tall, suave creatures strolled out and sweptpast me, some imperious, some contemptuous. It was a studied air, butthey did it well. I wonder what effect it has on the girl's mind asshe parades herself before the high-born ladies and gentlemen.But I catch the imperfection in their schooling. It is very amusing towatch them strut about until their display is made, and then, theirstunt done, slouch back into the dressing-rooms _sans_ carriage andmanner.And then, too, I am discovered. This also causes a break in the spellof their queenly stroll. They are laughing and at the same time tryingto maintain the dignity due to the gowns they are wearing. They becomeself-conscious and the effect is ludicrous.I am demoralising the institution, so we get away. I would like totalk to some of the models, but it can't be done very well.From there we go to a candy store, where I lay in a supply ofchocolates and preserved fruits for my trip into Germany the next day.I am invited by Sir Philip to visit him at his country home in Lympne,Kent, on my return from Germany.That evening I go with a party of Dudley Field Malone's to the PalaisRoyale in the Montmartre district. This is a novelty. Different. Seemsseveral steps ahead of America. And it has atmosphere, somethingentirely its own, that you feel so much more than you do the tangiblethings about you.There is a woman wearing a monocle. A simple touch, but how itchanges! The fashions here proclaim themselves even without comparisonand expert opinion.The music is simple, exotic, neurotic. Its simplicity demandsattention. It reaches inside you instead of affecting your feet.They are dancing a tango. It is entertainment just to watch them. Thepauses in the music, its dreamy cadences, its insinuation, itssuggestiveness, its whining, almost monotonous swing. It is tropicalyet, this Paris. And I realise that Paris is at a high pitch. Parishas not yet had relief from the cloddy numbness brought on with theWar. I wonder will relief come easily or will there be aconflagration.I meet Doughie, the correspondent. We recall our first meeting in thekitchen of Christine's in Greenwich Village.It is soon noised about that I am here and our table takes on theatmosphere of a reception. What a medley!Strangely garbed artists, long-haired poets, news-sheet and flowervendors, sightseers, students, children, and cocottes. Presently camea friend whom it was good to see again and we fix up a bit of a partyand get into Dudley's petrol wagon, and as we bowl along we singsongs, ancient songs of the music-halls. 'After the Ball,' 'The ManThat Broke the Bank of Monte Carlo,' and many another which I had notthought of in years.Presently the wagon becomes balky and will not continue. So we allpile out and into a tavern near by, where we call for wine.And Dudley played upon the tin-pan-sounding piano. There came one, atall, strange, pale youth, who asked if we would like to go to thehaunt of the Agile Rabbit. Thence uphill and into a cavernous place.When the patron came the youth ordered wine for us. Somehow I think hesensed the fact that I wanted to remain incognito.The patron was such a perfect host. Ancient and white bearded, heserved us with a finesse that was pure artistry. Then at his commandone named Rene Chedecal, with a sad, haunted face, played upon theviolin.That little house sheltered music that night. He played as if from hissoul, a message--yearning, passionate, sad, gay, and we werespeechless before the emotional beauty and mystery of it.I was overcome. I wanted to express my appreciation, but could do nomore than grasp his hand. Genius breeds in strange places and humble.And then the bearded one sang a song that he said the followers ofLafayette had sung before they left France for America. And all of usjoined in the chorus, singing lustily.Then a young chap did two songs from Verlaine, and a poet withconsiderable skill recited from his own poems. How effective for thecreator of a thought to interpret it. And afterward the violin playergave us another selection of great beauty, one of his owncompositions.Then the old patron asked me to put my name in his ledger, whichcontained many names of both humble and famous. I drew a picture of myhat, cane, and boots, which is my favourite autograph. I wrote, 'Iwould sooner be a gipsy than a movie man,' and signed my name.Home in the petrol wagon, which by this time had become manageableagain. An evening of rareness. Beauty, excitement, sadness and contactwith human, lovable personalities.Waldo Frank called the next day, bringing with him Jacques Copeau, oneof the foremost dramatists and actors in France, who manages anddirects in his own theatre. We go to the circus together and I neversaw so many sad-faced clowns. We dine together, and late that night Ihave supper with Copeau's company in a cafe in the Latin Quarter. Itis a gay night, lasting until about three in the morning.Frank and I set out to walk home together, but the section is toofascinating. Along about four o'clock we drift into another cafe,dimly lit but well attended. We sit there for some time, studying thevarious occupants.Over in one corner a young girl has just leaned over and kissed hersailor companion. No one seems to notice. All the girls here seemyoung, but their actions stamp their vocations. Music, stimulating,exotic, and for the dance, is being played. The girls are very muchalive. They are putting their hats on the men's heads.There are three peasant farmer boys, in all probability. They seemvery much embarrassed as three tiny girls, bright-eyed and red-lipped,join them for a drink. I can see fire smouldering in their dull facesin spite of their awkwardness in welcoming the girls.An interesting figure, Corsican, I should say, is very conspicuous. Agentleman by his bearing, debonair and graceful, he looks the verypicture of an impecunious count. He is visiting all the tables in thecafe. At most of them he calls the girls by their first names.He is taking up a collection for the musicians. Everyone iscontributing liberally. With each tinkle of a coin in the hat theCorsican bows elaborately and extends thanks.He finishes the collection.'On with the dance,' he shouts. 'Don't let the music stop,' as herattles the money. Then he puts his hand in his pocket and draws fortha single centime piece. It is very small, but his manner is that of aphilanthropist.'I give something, no matter how small; you notice, ladies andgentlemen, that I give something,' and he drops his coin in the hatand bows.The party progresses rapidly. They have started singing and have hadjust enough drink to make them maudlin. We leave.XI
INFP	MY VISIT TO GERMANYThe train to Germany left so late in the evening that it wasimpossible for me to see devastated France even though we passedthrough a considerable portion of it. Our compartment on the train isvery stuffy and smelly and the train service is atrocious, food andsanitary conditions being intolerable after American train service.Again there is a crowd at the station to see me off, but I am ratherenjoying it. A beautiful French girl presents me with a bouquet offlowers with a cute little speech, or at least I suppose it was,because she looked very cute delivering it, and the pouts that thelanguage gave to her red lips were most provocative. She tells me indelicious broken English that I look tired and sad, and I find myselfyielding without a struggle to her suggestion.We arrive at Joumont near the Belgian frontier along about midnight,and, like a message from home, there is a gang of American soldierboys at the station to greet me. And they are not alone, for French,Belgian, and British troops are also waving and cheering. I wanted totalk to the Belgians, and we tried it, but it was no use. What a pity!But one of them had a happy inspiration and saved the day.'Glass of beer, Charlot?'I nod, smiling. And to my surprise they bring me beer, which I lift tomy lips for politeness, and then drink it to the last drop in purepleasure. It is very good beer.There is a group of charming little Belgian girls. They are smiling atme shyly and I so want to say something to them. But I can't. Ah, thebouquet! Each little girl gets a rose and they are delighted.'_Merci, merci_, monsieur.' And they keep 'merciing' and bowing untilthe train pulls out of the station, which emboldens them to join thesoldiers in a cheer.Through an opening between the railroad structures I see a brilliantlighting display. It is universal, this sign. Here is a movie in thistiny village. What a wonderful medium, to reach such an obscure town.On the train I am being told that my pictures have not played inGermany, hence I am practically unknown there. This rather pleases mebecause I feel that I can relax and be away from crowds.Everyone on the train is nice and there is no trouble. Conductorsstruggle with English for my benefit, and the Customs officers makebut little trouble. In fact, we cross the border at three in themorning and I am asleep.Next morning I find a note from the Customs man saying; 'Good luck,Charlie. You were sleeping so soundly that I did not have the heartto wake you for inspection.'Germany is beautiful. Germany belies the war. There are peoplecrowding the fields, tilling the soil, working feverishly all the timeas our train rushes through. Men, women, and children are all at work.They are facing their problem and rebuilding. A great people,perverted for and by a few.The different style of architecture here is interesting. Factories arebeing built everywhere. Surely this isn't conquered territory. I donot see much live stock in the fields. This seems strange.A dining-car has been put on the train and the waiter comes to ourcompartment to let us know that we may eat. Here is a novelty. Aseven-course dinner, with wine, soup, meat, vegetables, salad,dessert, coffee, and bread for twenty-eight cents. This is madepossible by the low rate of exchange.We go to the Adlon Hotel in Berlin and find that hostelry jammed,owing to the auto races which are being run off at this time. Adifferent atmosphere here. It seems hard for me to relax and get thenormal reaction to meeting people. They don't know me here. I havenever been heard of. It interests me and I believe I resent it just abit.I notice how abrupt the Germans are to foreigners, and I detect atinge of bitterness, too. I am wondering about my pictures makingtheir debut here. I question the power of my personality without itsbackground of reputation.I am feeling more restful under this disinterested treatment, butsomehow I wish that my pictures had been shown here. The people at thehotel are very courteous. They have been told that I am the'white-headed boy and quite the guy in my home town.' Their reactionsare amusing. I am not very impressive-looking and they are finding ithard to believe.There is quite a crowd in the lobby and a number of Americans andEnglish. They are not long in finding me, and a number of English,French, and American reporters start making a fuss over me. TheGermans just stand and look on, bewildered.Carl von Weigand comes forward with the offer of the use of his officewhile I am here. The Germans are impressed with all this, but theyshow no enthusiasm. I am accepted in an offhand way as some one ofimportance and they let it go at that.The Scala Theatre, where I spent the evening, is most interesting,though I think a bit antiquated when compared with English andAmerican theatrical progress along the same lines. It seats about fivethousand, mostly on one floor, with a very small balcony. It is of thevariety-music-hall type, showing mostly 'dumb' acts. Acts that do nottalk or sing, like comic jugglers, acrobats, and dancers.I am amused by a German comedian singing a song of about twentyverses, but the audience is enthused and voices its approval at everyverse. During the intermission we have frankfurters and beer, whichare served in the theatre. I notice the crowds. They go to the theatrethere as a family. It is just that type of an affair.I notice the different types of beauty, though beauty is not very muchin evidence here. Here and there are a few pretty girls, but not many.It is interesting to watch the people strolling during theintermission, drinking lager and eating all sorts of food.Leaving the theatre, we visit the Scala Cafe, a sort ofimpressionistic casino. The Scala is one of the largest cafes inBerlin, where the modernist style in architecture has been carried outfully.The walls are deep mottled sea green, shading into light verdigris andemerald, leaning outward at an angle, thereby producing an effect ofcollapse and forward motion. The junction of the walls and the ceilingis broken into irregular slabs of stone, like the strata of a cave.Behind these the lights are hidden, the whole system of illuminationbeing based on reflection.The immense dislocation of the planes and angles of the vault-likeceiling is focused on the central point, the huge silver star orcrystal bursting like an exploding bomb through the roof. The wholeeffect is weird, almost ominous. The shape of the room in its groundplan is itself irregular--the impression is that of a frozencatastrophe. Yet this feeling seems to be in accord with the mood ofrevellers in Germany to-day.From there to the Palais Heinroth, the most expensive place in Berlinand the high spot of night life. It is conspicuous in its brilliance,because Berlin as a city is so badly lighted. At night the streets aredark and gloomy, and it is then that one gets the effect of war anddefeat.At the Heinroth everybody was in evening dress. We weren't. Myappearance did not cause any excitement. We check our hats and coatsand ask for a table. The manager shrugs his shoulders. There is one inthe back, a most obscure part of the room. This brings home forciblythe absence of my reputation. It nettled me. Well, I wanted rest. Thiswas it.We are about to accept humbly the isolated table, when I hear a shriekand I am slapped on the back and there's a yell:'Charlie!'It is Al Kaufman of the Lasky Corporation and manager of the FamousPlayers studio in Berlin.'Come over to our table. Pola Negri wants to meet you.'Again I come into my own. The Germans look on, wondering. I havecreated attention at last. I discover that there is an American jazzband in the place. In the middle of a number they stop playing andshout:'Hooray for Charlie Chaplin!'The proprietor shrugs his shoulders and the band resumes playing. Ilearn that the musicians are former American doughboys. I feel ratherpleased that I have impressed the Germans in the place.In our party were Rita Kaufman, wife of Al, Pola Negri, Carl Robinson,and myself.Pola Negri is really beautiful. She is Polish and really true to thetype. Beautiful jet-black hair, white, even teeth and wonderfulcoloring. I think it such a pity that such coloring does not registeron the screen.She is the centre of attraction here. I am introduced. What a voiceshe has! Her mouth speaks so prettily the German language. Her voicehas a soft, mellow quality, with charming inflections. Offered adrink, she clinks my glass and offers her only English words, 'Jazzboy Charlie.'Language again stumps me. What a pity! But with the aid of a thirdparty we get along famously. Kaufman whispers: 'Charlie, you've made ahit. She just told me that you are charming.''You tell her that she's the loveliest thing I've seen in Europe.'These compliments keep up for some time, and then I ask Kaufman how tosay, 'I think you are divine' in German. He tells me something inGerman and I repeat it to her.She's startled and looks up and slaps my hand.'Naughty boy,' she says.The table roars. I sense that I have been double-crossed by Kaufman.What have I said? But Pola joins in the joke, and there is nocasualty. I learn later that I have said, 'I think you are terrible.'I decided to go home and learn German.As I am going out the proprietor approaches and very formallyaddresses me: 'I beg pardon, sir. I understand that you are a greatman in the United States. Accept my apologies for not knowing, and thegates here are always open to you.' I accept them formally, thoughthrough it all I feel very comic opera. I didn't like the proprietor.I want to go through the German slums. I mention such a trip to aGerman newspaper man. I am told that I am just like every Londoner andNew-Yorker who comes to Berlin for the first time; that I want theWhitechapel district, the Bowery of Berlin, and that there is no suchdistrict. Once upon a time there were hovels in Berlin, but they havelong since disappeared.This to me is a real step toward civilisation.My newspaper friend tells me that he will give me the next best thingto the slums, and we go to Krogel. What a picture could be made here!I am fascinated as I wander through houses mounted on shaky stilts andcourts ancient but cleanly.Then we drove to Acker Street and gazed into courts and basements. Ina cafe we talked to men and women and drank beer. I almost launched anew war when, wishing to pay a charge of one hundred and eighty marks,I pulled from my pocket a roll of fifty one-thousand-mark notes.My friend paid the check quickly with small change and hustled me out,telling me of the hard faces and criminal types who were watching.He's probably right, but I love those poor, humble people.We drove to the arbor colonies in the northern part of the city,stopping at some of the arbors to talk to the people. I feel that Iwould like to eat dinner here among these people, but I haven'tsufficient courage to persuade my companion, who wouldn't think of it.Passing through the northern part of Berlin, I found many beautieswhich, my friend let me know, were not considered beautiful at all.He even suggested that he show me something in contrast with all I hadseen. I told him no, that it would spoil my whole viewpoint.It has been rather a restful experience, going through the whole townwithout being recognised, but even as I am thinking it a fashionablelady and her young daughter pass, and by their smiles I know that I amagain discovered.And then we meet Fritz Kreisler and his wife, who are just leaving forMunich. We have quite a chat and then make tentative engagements to becarried out in Los Angeles on his next trip there.I notice that the Germans seem to be scrupulously honest, or maybethis was all the more noticeable to me because of genial andunsuspicious treatment by a taxi driver. We left the cab many timesand were gone as long as half an hour at a time, and out of sight, yethe always waited and never suggested that he be paid beforehand.In the business section we pass many cripples with embittered, sullenlooks on their faces. They look as though they had paid for somethingwhich they hadn't received.We are approached by a legless soldier beggar in a faded Germanuniform. Here was the War's mark. These sights you will find on everyside in Berlin.I am presented with a police card to the Berliner Club, which isevidently a technicality by which the law is circumvented. Berlin isfull of such night-life clubs. They are somewhat like the gatheringsthat Prohibition has brought to America.There are no signs, however, from the outside of any activity, and youare compelled to go up dark passages and suddenly come upon gaily litrooms very similar to Parisian cafes.Dancing and popping corks are the first impression as I enter. We aretaken in hand by two girls and they order drinks for us. The girls arevery nervous. In fact, the whole night-life of this town seems to benervous, neurotic, over-done.The girls dance, but very badly. They do not seem to enjoy it andtreat it as part of the job. They are very much interested in myfriend, who seems to have the money for the party. On these occasionsmy secretary always carries the family roll, and they are paying muchattention to him.I sit here rather moody and quiet, though one of the girls works hardto cheer me up. I hear her asking Robinson what is the matter with me.I smile and become courteous. But, her duty done, she turns again toRobinson.I am piqued. Where is that personality of mine? I have been told manytimes that I have it. But here it is convincingly shown thatpersonality has no chance against 'pursenality.'But I am beginning to get so much attention from my friends that oneof the girls is noticing me. She senses that I am some one important,but she can't quite make it out.'Who is this guy, an English diplomat?' she whispers to Robinson. Hewhispers back that I am a man of considerable importance in thediplomatic service. I smile benevolently and they become moreinterested.I am treating her rather paternally and am feeling philosophical. Iask about her life. What is she doing with it? What ambitions? She isa great reader, she tells me, and likes Schopenhauer and Nietzsche.But she shrugs her shoulders in an indifferent and tragic manner andsays, 'What does it matter about life?''You make it what it is,' she says. 'In your brain alone it exists andeffort is only necessary for physical comfort.' We are becoming closerfriends as she tells me this.But she must have some objective, there must be some dreams of thefuture still alive within her. I am very anxious to know what shereally thinks.I ask her about the defeat of Germany. She becomes discreet at once.Blames it on the Kaiser. She hates war and militarism. That's all Ican get out of her, and it is getting late and we must leave. Herfuture intrigues me, but does not seem to worry her.On the way home we step in at Kaufman's apartment and have quite achat about pictures and things back in Los Angeles. Los Angeles seemsvery far away.I am invited to a formal dinner party for the next evening at the homeof Herr Werthauer, one of the most prominent lawyers in all Europe anda chief of the Kaiser during the war. The occasion for the dinner wasto celebrate the announcement of Werthauer's engagement to his thirdwife.His is a wonderful home in the finest section of Berlin. At the partythere are a number of his personal friends, Pola Negri, Al Kaufman,Mrs. Kaufman, Robinson, and myself.There is a Russian band playing native music all through the dinnerand jazz music is also being dispensed by two orchestras made up ofAmerican doughboys who have been discharged, but have stayed on inGermany.For no reason at all, I think of the story of Rasputin. This seems thesort of house for elaborate murders. Perhaps it is the Russian musicthat is having this effect on me. There is a huge marble staircasewhose cold austereness suggests all sorts of things designed to sendchills up the spine. The servants are so impressive and the meal sucha ceremony that I feel that I am in a palace. The Russian folk-songsthat are being dreamily whined from the strings of their peculiarinstruments have a very weird effect and I find food and dining theleast interesting things here.There is a touch of mystery, of the exotic, something so foreignthough intangible, that I find myself searching everything andeverybody, trying to delve deeper into this atmosphere.We are all introduced, but there are too many people for me to try toremember names. There are herrs, fraeuleins, and fraus galore, and Ifind it hard to keep even their sex salutations correct. Some one ismaking a long, formal speech in German, and everybody is watching himattentively.The host arises and offers a toast to his bride-to-be. Everyone risesand drinks to their happiness. The party is very formal and I can makenothing from the talk going on all about me. The host is talking andthen all get up again with their glasses. Why, I don't know, but I getup with them.At this there is general laughter, and I wonder what calamity hasbefallen me. I wonder if my clothes are all right.Then I understand. The host is about to toast me. He does it in verybad English, though his gestures and tone make it most graceful. He isinclined to be somewhat pedantic and whenever he cannot think of theproper English word he uses its German equivalent.As the various courses come the toasts are many. I am always about twobites late in getting to my feet with my glass. After I have beentoasted about four times, Mrs. Kaufman leans over and whispers, 'Youshould toast back again to the host and say something nice about hisbride-to-be.'I am almost gagged with the stage fright that grips me. It is thecustom to toast back to the host and here I have been gulping down allkinds of toasts without a word. And he had been sitting there waitingfor me.I rise and hesitate. 'Mr.--'I feel a kick on the shins and I hear Mrs. Kaufman whisper hoarsely:'Herr.'I think she means the bride-to-be. 'Mrs.--' No, she isn't that yet.Heavens! this is terrible.I plunge in fast and furious. 'My very best respects to your futurewife.' As I speak I look at a young girl at the head of the table whomI thought was the lucky woman. I am all wrong. I sit, conscious ofsome horrible mistake.He bows and thanks me. Mrs. Kaufman scowls and says: 'That's not thewoman. It's the one on the other side.'I have a suppressed convulsion and almost die, and as she points outthe real bride-to-be I find myself laughing hysterically into my soup.Rita Kaufman is laughing with me. Thank heaven for a sense of humour.I am so weak and nervous that I am almost tempted to leave at once.The bride-to-be is reaching for her glass to return my salute, thoughunless she thinks I am cross-eyed I don't see how she knows I saidanything nice to her.But she gets no chance to speak. There is launched a long-windedpedantic speech from the host, who says that on such rare occasions asthis it is customary to uncork the best in the cellar. This point getsover in great shape and everybody is smiling.I even feel myself growing radiant. I was under the impression thatthe best had already been served. Didn't know he was holding backanything. With the promise of better wine I am tempted to try anothertoast to the bride-to-be.XII
INFP	I FLY FROM PARIS TO LONDONThe first night in Paris after our return from Germany we dined atPioccardi's, then walked up to the arches of the old gates of Paris.Our intention was to visit the Louvre and see the statue of Venus deMilo, but it only got as far as intention.We drifted into the Montmartre district and stopped in Le Rat Mort,one of its most famous restaurants. As it is very early in theevening, there are very few people about--one reason why I picked outthis place, which later in the night becomes the centre of hecticrevelry.Passing our table is a striking-looking girl with bobbed blond hair,shadowing beautiful, delicate features of pale coloring and soft,strange eyes of a violet blue. Her passing is momentary, but she isthe most striking-looking girl I have seen in Europe.Although there are but few people here, I am soon recognised. TheFrench are so demonstrative. They wave, 'Hello, Charlot!'I am indifferent. I smile mechanically. I am tired. I shall go to bedearly. I order champagne.The bobbed-hair one is sitting at a table near us. She interests me.But she doesn't turn so that I can see her face. She is sitting facingher friend, a dark, Spanish-looking girl.I wish she'd turn. She has a beautiful profile, but I would like tosee her full face again. She looked so lovely when she passed mebefore. I recall that ghost of a smile that hovered near her mouth,showing just a bit of beautiful, even, white teeth.The orchestra is starting and dancers are swinging on to the floor.The two girls rise and join the dance. I will watch closely now andperhaps get another flash at her when she whirls by.There is something refined and distinguished about the little girl.She is different. Doesn't belong here. I am watching her very closely,though she has never once looked my way. I like this touch of theunusual in Montmartre. Still she may be just clever.She is passing me in the dance and I get a full view of her face. Oneof real beauty, with a sensitive mouth, smiling at her friend andgiving a complete view of the beautiful teeth. Her face is mostexpressive. The music stops and they sit at their table.I notice that there is nothing on their table. They are not drinking.This is strange, here. Nor are there sandwiches or coffee. I wonderwho they are. That girl is somebody. I know it.She gets up as the orchestra plays a few strains of a plaintiveRussian thing. She is singing the song. Fascinating! An artist! Why isshe here? I must know her.The song itself is plaintive, elemental, with the insinuating nuancesthat are vital to Russian music. The orchestra, with the violins and'cellos predominant, is playing hauntingly, weaving a foreign exoticspell.She has poise, grace, and is compelling attention even in this place.There comes a bit of melancholy in the song and she sings it as onepossessed, giving it drama, pathos. Suddenly there is a change. Themusic leaps to wild abandon. She is with it. She tosses her head likea wild Hungarian gipsy and gives fire to every note. But almost as itbegan, the abandon is over. With wistful sweetness, she is singingplaintively again.She is touching every human emotion in her song. At times she istossing away care, then gently wooing, an elusive strain that isalmost fairylike, that crescendos into tragedy, going into a crashingclimax that diminishes into an ending, searching yearning, andwistfully sad.Her personality is written into every mood of the song. She is at oncefine, courageous, pathetic, and wild. She finished to an applause thatreflected the indifference of the place. In spots it was spontaneousand insistent. In others little attention was paid to her. She iswasted here.But she cares not. In her face you can see that she gets her applausein the song itself. It was glorious, just to be singing with heart,soul and voice. She smiles faintly, then sits down modestly.I knew it. She is Russian. She has everything to suggest it. Full oftemperament, talent and real emotional ability, hidden away here in LeRat Mort. What a sensation she would be in America with a littleadvertising! This is just a thought, but all sorts of schemes presentthemselves to me.I can see her in 'The Follies' with superb dressing and doing just thesong she had done then. I did not understand a word of it, but I feltevery syllable. Art is universal and needs no language. She haseverything from gentleness to passion and a startling beauty. I amapplauding too much, but she looks and smiles, so I am repaid.They dance again, and while they are gone I call the waiter and havehim explain to the manager that I would like to be presented to her.The manager introduces her and I invite her to my table. She sitsthere with us, while her companion, the dark girl, does a solo dance.She talks charmingly and without restraint. She speaks threelanguages--Russian, French, and English. Her father was a Russiangeneral during the Tsar's reign. I can see now where she gets herimperious carriage.'Are you a Bolshevik?'She flushes as I ask it, and her lips pout prettily as she struggleswith English. She seems all afire.'No, they are wicked. Bolshevik man, he's very bad.' Her eyes flash asshe speaks.'Then you are bourgeoisie?''No, but not a Bolshevik.' Her voice suggests a tremendous vitality,though her vocabulary is limited. 'Bolshevik good idea for the mind,but not for practice.''Has it had a fair opportunity?' I ask her.'Plenty. My father, my mother, my brother all in Russia and very poor.Mother is Bolshevik, father bourgeoisie. Bolshevik man very impudentto me. I want to kill him. He insult me. What can I do? I escape.Bolshevik good idea, but no good for life.''What of Lenin?''Very clever man. He tried hard for Bolshevik--but no good foreverybody--just in the head.'I learn that she was educated in a convent and that she had lost alltrace of her people. She earns her living singing here. She has beento the movies, but has never seen me. She 'is go first chance becauseI am nice man.'I ask her if she would like to go into moving pictures. Her eyes lightup.'If I get opportunity I know I make success. But'--she curls her mouthprettily--'it's difficult to get opportunity.'She is just twenty years old and has been in the cafe for two weeks,coming there from Turkey, to which country she fled following herescape from Russia.I explain that she must have photographic tests made and that I willtry to get her a position in America. She puts everything into hereyes as she thanks me. She looks like a combination of Mary Pickfordand Pola Negri plus her own distinctive beauty and personality. Hername is 'Skaya.' I write her full name and address in my book andpromise to do all I can for her. And I mean to. We say 'Good Night,'and she says she feels that I will do what I say. How has she kepthidden?Due at Sir Philip Sassoon's for a garden party the next day, I decideto go there in an aeroplane and I leave the Le Bourget aerodrome inParis in a plane of La Compagnie des Messageries Aeriennes, and atspecial request the pilot landed me at Lympne in Kent and I therebyavoided the crowd that would have been on hand in London.It was quite thrilling and I felt that I made a very effectiveentrance to the party.And what a delightful retreat! All the charm of an English countryhome, and Sir Philip is a perfect host. I get English food andtreatment. I have a perfect rest, with no duties, and entertainment asI desire it. A day and a half that are most pleasant!  [Illustration: I meet Lady Rocksavage and Sir Philip Sassoon.]Next day there is to be a ceremonial in the schoolhouse, when amemorial is to be unveiled. It is in honour of the boys of thetown who had fallen. There are mothers, fathers, and many old people,some of them old in years, others aged by the trials of the war.The simple affair is most impressive and the streets are crowded onour way. I was to blame for an unhappy contrast. Outside people wereshouting, 'Hooray for Charlie!' while inside souls were hushed ingrief.Such a discordant note. I wished I had not been so prominent. I wantedeveryone to bow in respect to these dead. The crowds did not belongoutside.And inside, on the little children's faces, I could see conflictingemotions. There is the reverence for the dead and yet there iseagerness as they steal glances at me. I wish I hadn't come. I feelthat I am the disturbing element.From the school Sir Philip and I went to the Star and Garter Hospitalfor wounded soldiers. Sheer tragedy was here.Young men suffering from spinal wounds, some of them with legswithered, some suffering from shell shock. No hope for them, yet theysmiled.There was one whose hands were all twisted and he was painting signswith a brush held between his teeth. I looked at the signs. They weremottoes: 'Never Say Die,' 'Are We Downhearted?' A superman.Here is a lad who must take an anaesthetic whenever his nails are cutbecause of his twisted limbs. And he is smiling and to allappearances happy. The capacity that God gives for suffering is sotremendous, I marvel at their endurance.I inquire about food and general conditions. They suggest that thefood could be better. This is attended to.We are received politely and with smiles from the crippled lads whoare crippled in flesh only. Their spirit is boisterous. I feel a punyatom as they shout, 'Good luck to you, Charlie.'I can't talk. There is nothing for me to say. I merely smile and nodand shake hands whenever this is possible. I sign autographs for asmany as ask and I ask them to give me their autographs. I honestlywant them.One jovially says, 'Sure, and Bill will give you one too.' There is anuproar of laughter and Bill laughs just as loud as the rest. Bill hasno arms.But he bests them. He will sign at that. And he does. With his teeth.Such is their spirit. What is to become of them? That is up to you andme.Back to Sir Philip's, very tired and depressed. We dine late and I goto my room and read Waldo Frank's 'Dark Mothers.' The next day thereis tennis and music and in the evening I leave for London, where I amto meet H. G. Wells and go with him to his country home.I am looking forward to this Saturday, Sunday, and Monday as anintellectual holiday. I meet H. G. at Whitehall and he is driving hisown car. He is a very good chauffeur, too.We talk politics and discuss the Irish settlement and I tell him of mytrip to Germany. That leads to a discussion of the depreciation in thevalue of the mark. What will be the outcome? Wells thinks financialcollapse. He thinks that marks issued as they are in Germany will beworthless.I am feeling more intimate and closer to him. There is no strain intalking, though I am still a bit self-conscious and find myselfwatching myself closely.We are out in the country, near Lady Warwick's estate, and H. G. tellsme how the beautiful place is going to seed; that parts of it arebeing divided into lots and sold.The estate, with its live stock, is a show place. It is breeding timefor the deer and from the road we can hear the stags bellowing. H. G.tells me they are dangerous at this time of the year.At the gate of the Wells' estate a young lad of ten greets us with ajovial twinkling of the eye and a brisk manner. There is no mistakinghim. He is H. G.'s son. There is the same moulding of the structureand the same rounded face and eyes. H. G. must have looked that way athis age.'Hello, dad,' as he jumps on the running board.'This is Charlie,' H. G. introduces me.He takes my grip. 'How do?' and I notice what a fine boy he is.Mrs. Wells is a charming little lady with keen, soft eyes that arealways smiling and apparently searching and seeking something. A realgentlewoman, soft voiced, also with humorous lines playing around hermouth.Everyone seems busy taking me into the house, and once there H. G.takes me all over it, to my room, the dining-room, the sitting-roomand, an extra privilege, to his study. 'My workshop,' he calls it.'Here's where the great events in the history of the world tookplace?'He smiles and says 'yes.' The 'Outline of History' was born here.The room is not yet finished, and it is being decorated around thefireplace by paintings made by himself and wife. 'I paint a bit,' heexplains. There is also some tapestry woven by his mother.'Here is a place if you want to escape when the strain is too much foryou. Come here and relax.'I felt that this was his greatest hospitality. But I never used theroom. I had a feeling about that, too.The study is simple and very spare of furniture. There is anold-fashioned desk and I get the general impression of books, but Ican remember but one, the dictionary. Rare observation on my part tonotice nothing but a dictionary, and this was so huge as it stood onhis desk that I couldn't miss it.There is a lovely view from the house of the countryside, with widestretches of land and lovely trees, where deer are roaming aroundunafraid.Mrs. Wells is getting lunch and we have it outdoors. Junior is there,the boy--I call him that already. Their conversation is rapid,flippant. Father and son have a profound analytical discussion aboutthe sting of a wasp as one of the insects buzzed around the table.It is a bit strange to me and I cannot get into the spirit of it,though it is very funny. I just watch and smile. Junior is very witty.He tops his father with jokes, but I sense the fact that H. G. isplaying up to him. There is a twinkle in H. G.'s eye. He is proud ofhis boy. He should be.After lunch we walk about the grounds and I doze most of the afternoonin the summer-house. They leave me alone and I have my nap out.A number of friends arrive later in the evening and we are introducedall around. Most of these are literary, and the discussion is learned.St. John Ervine, the dramatist and author of 'John Ferguson,' came inlater in the evening.Ervine discusses the possibility of synchronising the voice withmotion pictures. He is very much interested. I explain that I don'tthink the voice is necessary, that it spoils the art as much aspainting statuary. I would as soon rouge marble cheeks. Pictures arepantomimic art. We might as well have the stage. There would benothing left to the imagination.Another son comes in. He is more like his mother. We all decide toplay charades and I am selected as one of the actors. I play Orlando,the wrestler, getting a lot of fun through using a coal hod as ahelmet. Then Noah's Ark, with Junior imitating the different animalsgoing into the ark, using walking sticks as horns for a stag, andputting a hat on the end of the stick for a camel, and makingelephants and many other animals through adroit, quick changes. Iplayed old Noah and opened an umbrella and looked at the sky. Then Iwent into the ark and they guessed.Then H. G. Wells did a clog dance, and did it very well. We talked farinto the night, and I marvelled at Wells's vitality. We played manymental guessing games and Junior took all the honours.I was awakened next morning by a chorus outside my door: 'We wantCharlie Chaplin.' This was repeated many times. They had been waitingbreakfast half an hour for me.After breakfast we played a new game of H. G.'s own invention.Everyone was in it and we played it in the barn. It was a combinationof handball and tennis, with rules made by H. G. Very exciting andgood fun.Then a walk to Lady Warwick's estate. As I walk I recall how dramaticit had sounded last night as I was in bed to hear the stags bellowing,evidently their cry of battle.The castle, with beautiful gardens going to seed, seemed very sad,yet its ruins assumed a beauty for me. I liked it better that way.Ruins are majestic.H. G. explains that everyone about is land poor. It takes on afantastic beauty for me, this cultivation of centuries now going toseed, beautiful in its very tragedy.Home for tea, and in the evening I teach them baseball. Here is my onechance to shine. It is funny to see H. G. try to throw a curve andbeing caught at first base after hitting a grounder to the pitcher. H.G. pitched, and his son caught. As a baseball player H. G. is a greatwriter. Dinner that night is perfect, made more enjoyable for ourstrenuous exercise. As I retire that night I think of what a wonderfulholiday I am having.Next day I must leave at 2.30 p.m., but in the morning H. G. and Itake a walk and visit an old country church built in the eleventhcentury. A man is working on a tomb-stone in the churchyard, engravingan epitaph.H. G. points out the influence of the different lords of the manor onthe art changes of different periods. Here the families of LadyWarwick and other notable people are buried. The tombstones show theinfluence of the sculpture of all periods.We go to the top of the church and view the surrounding country andthen back home for lunch. My things are all packed and H. G. and hisson see me off. H. G. reminds me not to forget another engagement todine with him and Chaliapin, the famous Russian baritone.As I speed into town I am wondering if Wells wants to know me orwhether he wants me to know him. I am certain that now I have metWells, really met him, more than I've met anyone in Europe. It's soworth while.XIV.FAREWELLS TO PARIS AND LONDONI had promised to attend the _premiere_ showing of 'The Kid' in Paris,and I went back to the French capital as I came, via aeroplane. Thetrip was uneventful, and on landing and going to my hotel I find amessage from Doug Fairbanks. He and Mary had arrived in Paris and werestopping at the Crillon. They asked me over for a chat but I was tootired. Doug promised to attend the _premiere_ at the TrocaderoTheatre.During the afternoon there came 250 souvenir programmes to beautographed. These were to be sold that night for 100 francs each.In the evening I went to the theatre _via_ the back way, but there wasno escape. It was the biggest demonstration I had yet seen. Forseveral blocks around the crowds were jammed in the streets and thegendarmes had their hands full.Paris had declared a holiday for this occasion, and as the proceeds ofthe entertainment were to be given to the fund for devastated Francethe elite of the country were there. I am introduced to AmbassadorHerrick, then shown to my box and introduced to the Ministers of theFrench Cabinet.I do not attempt to remember names, but the following list has beenpreserved for me by my secretary:M. Menard, who attended on behalf of President Millerand; M.Jusserand, M. Herbette, M. Careron, M. Loucheur, Minister of theLiberated Regions; M. Hermite, Col. and Mrs. H. H. Harjes, Miss HopeHarjes, Mr. and Mrs. Ridgeley Carter, Mrs. Arthur James, Mrs. W. K.Vanderbilt, Mrs. Rutherford Stuyvesant, Walter Berry, M. de Errazu,Marquis de Vallambrosa, Mlle. Cecile Sorel, Robert Hostetter, M.Byron-Kuhn, Mr. and Mrs. Charles G. Loeb, Florence O'Neill, M. HenriLettelier, M. Georges Carpentier, Paul C. Otey, Mr. and Mrs. GeorgeKenneth End, Prince George of Greece, Princess Xenia, PrinceChristopher, Lady Sarah Wilson, Mrs. Elsa Maxwell, Princess Sutzo,Vice-Admiral and Mrs. Albert P. Niblack, Comte and Comtesse Cardelli,Duchess de Talleyrand, Col. and Mrs. N. D. Jay, Col. Bunau Varila,Marquise de Talleyrand-Perigord, Marquis and Marquise de Chambrun,Miss Viola Cross, Miss Elsie De Wolf, Marquis and Marquise deDampierre, and Mr. and Mrs. Theodore Rousseau.My box is draped with American and British flags, and the applause isso insistent that I find I am embarrassed. But there is a delicioustingle to it and I am feeling now what Doug felt when his 'ThreeMusketeers' was shown. The programmes which I autographed during theafternoon are sold immediately and the audience wants more. Iautograph as many more as possible.I am photographed many times and I sit in a daze through most of it,at one time going back stage, though I don't know why, except that Iwas photoed back there too.The picture was shown, but I did not see much of it. There was toomuch to be seen in that audience.At the end of the picture there came a messenger from the Minister:'Would I come to his box and be decorated?' I almost fell out of mybox.I grew sick. What would I say? There was no chance to prepare. I hadvisions of the all-night preparation for my speech in Southampton.This would be infinitely worse. I couldn't even think clearly. Why doI pick out stunts like that? I might have known that something wouldhappen.But the floor would not open up for me to sink through and there wasno one in this friendly audience who could help in my dilemma, and themessenger was waiting politely, though I imagined just a bitimpatiently, so, summoning what courage I had, I went to the box withabout the same feeling as a man approaching the guillotine.I am presented to everybody. He makes a speech. It is translated forme, but very badly. While he was speaking I tried to think ofsomething neat and appropriate, but all my thoughts seemed trite. Ifinally realised that he was finished and I merely said '_Merci_,'which, after all, was about as good as I could have done.And believe me, I meant '_Merci_' both in French and in English.But the applause is continuing. I must say something, so I stand up inthe box and make a speech about the motion-picture industry and tellthem that it is a privilege for us to make a presentation for such acause as that of devastated France.Somehow they liked it, or made me believe they did. There was atremendous demonstration and several bearded men kissed me before Icould get out. But I was blocked in and the crowd wouldn't leave. Atlast the lights were turned out, but still they lingered. Then therecame an old watchman who said he could take us through an unknownpassage that led to the street.We followed him and managed to escape, though there was still atremendous crowd to break through in the street. Outside I meet Cami,who congratulates me, and together we go to the Hotel Crillon to seeDoug and Mary.Mary and Doug are very kind in congratulating me, and I tell them ofmy terrible conduct during the presentation of the decoration. I knewthat I was wholly inadequate for the occasion. I keep mumbling of my_faux pas_ and they try to make me forget my misery by telling me thatGeneral Pershing is in the next room.I'll bet the general never went through a battle like the one I passedthrough that night.Then they wanted to see the decoration, which reminded me that I hadnot yet looked at it myself. So I unrolled the parchment and Doug readaloud the magic words from the Minister of Instruction of the Publicand Beaux Arts which made Charles Chaplin, dramatist, artist, an_Officier de L'instruction Publique_.We sit there until three in the morning, discussing it, and then I goback to my hotel tired but rather happy. That night was worth all thetrip to Europe.At the hotel there was a note from Skaya. She had been to the theatreto see the picture. She sat in the gallery and saw 'The Kid,' takingtime off from her work.Her note:     'I saw picture. You are a grand man. My heart is joy. You must     be happy. I laugh--I cry.                                                           'SKAYA.'This little message was not the least of my pleasures that night.Elsie De Wolf was my hostess at luncheon next day at the VillaTrianon, Versailles, a most interesting and enjoyable occasion, whereI met some of the foremost poets and artists.Returning to Paris, I meet Henry Wales, and we take a trip through theLatin Quarter together. That night I dine with Cami, GeorgesCarpentier, and Henri Letellier. Carpentier asks for an autograph andI draw him a picture of my hat, shoes, cane, and moustache, myimplements of trade. Carpentier, not to be outdone, draws for me ahuge fist encased in a boxing glove.I am due back in England next day to lunch with Sir Philip Sassoon andto meet Lloyd George. Lord and Lady Rocksavage, Lady Diana Manners,and many other prominent people are to be among the guests, and I amlooking forward to the luncheon eagerly.We are going back by aeroplane, though Carl Robinson lets me know thathe prefers some other mode of travel. On this occasion I am nervousand I say frequently that I feel as though something is going tohappen. This does not make a hit with Carl.We figure that by leaving at eight o'clock in the morning we can makeLondon by one o'clock, which will give me plenty of time to keep myengagement.But we hadn't been up long before we were lost in the fog over theChannel and were forced to make a landing on the French coast, causinga delay of two hours. But we finally made it, though I was two hourslate for my engagement, and the thought of keeping Lloyd George andthose other people waiting was ghastly.Our landing in England was made at the Croydon aerodrome, and therewas a big automobile waiting outside, around which were severalhundred people. The aerodrome officials, assuming that the car was forme, hustled me into it and it was driven off.But it was not mine, and I found that I was not being driven to theRitz, but the Majestic Theatre in Clapham.The chauffeur wore a moustache, and, though he looked familiar, I didnot recognise him. But very dramatically he removed the moustache.'I am Castleton Knight. A long time ago you promised me to visit mytheatre. I have concluded that the only way to get you there is tokidnap you. So kindly consider yourself kidnapped.'I couldn't help but laugh, even as I thought of Lloyd George, and Iassured Mr. Knight that he was the first one who had ever kidnappedme. So we went to the theatre, and I stayed an hour and surprised bothmyself and the audience by making a speech.Back to my hotel Sir Philip meets me and tells me that Lloyd Georgecouldn't wait, that he had a most important engagement at fouro'clock. I explained the aeroplane situation to Sir Philip and he wasvery kind. I feel that it was most unfortunate, for it was my onlyopportunity to meet Lloyd George in these times, and I love to meetinteresting personages. I would like to meet Lenin, Trotsky, and theKaiser.This is to be my last night in England, and I have promised to dineand spend the evening with my Cousin Aubrey. One feels dutiful toone's cousin.I also discover that this is the day I am to meet Chaliapin and H. G.Wells. I 'phone H. G. and explain that this is my last day, and of mypromise to my cousin. H. G. is very nice. He understands. You canonly do these things with such people.My cousin calls for me at dusk in a taxi and we ride to his home inBayswater. London is so beautiful at this hour, when the first lightsare being turned on, and each light to me is symbolical. They all meanlife, and I wish sometimes I could peer behind all these lightedwindows.Reaching Aubrey's home I notice a number of people on the other sideof the street standing in the shadows. They must be reporters, Ithink, and am slightly annoyed that they should find me even here. Butmy cousin explains hesitatingly that they are just friends of hiswaiting for a look at me.I feel mean and naughty about this, as I recall that I had requestedhim not to make a party of my visit.I just wanted a family affair, with no visitors, and these simplesouls on the other side of the street were respecting my wishes. Irelent and tell Aubrey to ask them over, anyway. They are all quitenice, simple tradesmen, clerks, etc.Aubrey has a saloon, or at least a hotel, as he calls it, in thevicinity of Bayswater, and later in the evening I suggest that we gothere and take his friends with us. Aubrey is shocked.'No, not around to my place.' Then they all demur. They don't wish tointrude. I like this. Then I insist. They weaken. He weakens.We enter a bar. The place is doing a flourishing business. There are anumber of pictures of my brother Syd and myself all over the walls, incharacter and straight. The place is packed to-night. It must be avery popular resort.'What will you have?' I feel breezy. 'Give the whole saloon a drink.'Aubrey whispers, 'Don't let them know you are here.' He says this forme.But I insist. 'Introduce me to all of them.' I must get him morecustom.He starts quietly whispering to some of his very personal friends:'This is my cousin. Don't say a word.'I speak up rather loudly. 'Give them all a drink.' I feel a bit vulgarto-night. I want to spend money like a drunken sailor. Even thecustomers are shocked. They hardly believe that it's Charlie Chaplin,who always avoids publicity, acting in this vulgar way.I am sure that some of them don't believe despite many assurances. Astunt of my cousin's. But they drink, reverently and with reserve, andthen they bid me good night, and we depart quietly, leaving Bayswateras respectable as ever.To the house for dinner, after which some one brings forth an oldfamily album. It is just like all other family albums.'This is your great-granduncle and that is your great-grandmother.This is Aunt Lucy. This one was a French general.'Aubrey says: 'You know we have quite a good family on your father'sside.' There are pictures of uncles who are very prosperous cattleranchers in South Africa. Wonder why I don't hear from my prosperousrelations.This is the first time that I am aware of my family and I am nowconvinced that we are true aristocrats, blue blood of the first water.Aubrey has children, a boy of twelve, whom I have never met before. Afine boy. I suggest educating him. We talk of it at length and withstress. 'Let's keep up family tradition. He may be a member ofParliament or perhaps President. He's a bright boy.'We dig up all the family and discuss them. The uncles in Spain. Why,we Chaplins have populated the earth.When I came I told Aubrey that I could stay only two hours, but it is4 a.m. and we are still talking. As we leave Aubrey walks with metoward the Ritz.We hail a Ford truck on the way and a rather dandified young Johnny, aformer officer, gives us a lift.'Right you are. Jump on.'A new element, these dandies driving trucks, some of them graduates ofCambridge and Oxford, of good families, most of them, impecuniousaristocrats. Perhaps it is the best thing that could happen to suchfamilies.This chap is very quiet and gentle. He talks mostly of his truck andhis marketing, which he thinks is quite a game. He has been in thegrocery business since the war and has never made so much money. Weget a good bit of his story as we jolt along in the truck.He is providing vegetables and fruit for all his friends in Bayswater,and every morning at four o'clock he is on his way to the market. Heloves the truck. It is so simple to drive.'Half a mo.' He stops talking and pulls up for petrol at a prettylittle white-tiled petrol station. The station is all lit up, thoughit is but 5 a.m.'Good morning. Give me about five gal.''Right-o!'The cheery greeting means more than the simple words that are said.The lad recognises me and greets me frankly, though formally. It seemsso strange to me to hear this truck driver go along conversing in theeasiest possible manner. A truck driver who enjoyed truck driving.He spoke of films for just a bit and then discreetly stopped,thinking, perhaps, that I might not like to talk about them. And,besides, he liked to talk about his truck.He told us how wonderful it was to drive along in the early morningwith only the company of dawn and the stars. He loved the silentstreets, sleeping London. He was enterprising, full of hopes andambitions. Told how he bartered. He knew how. His was a lovelybusiness.He was smoking a pipe and wore a trilby hat, with a sort of frockcoat, and his neck was wrapped in a scarf. I figured him to be aboutthirty years of age.I nudged my cousin. Would he accept anything? We hardly know whetheror not to offer it, though he is going out of his way to drive me tothe Ritz.He has insisted that it is no trouble, that he can cut through toCovent Garden. No trouble. I tell the petrol man to fill it up and Iinsist on paying for the petrol.The lad protests, but I insist.'That's very nice of you, really. But it was a pleasure to have you,'he says, as he gets back in his seat.We cut through to Piccadilly and pull up at the Ritz in a Ford truck.Quite an arrival.The lad bids us good-bye. 'Delighted to have met you. Hope you have abully time. Too bad you are leaving. Bon voyage. Come back in thespring. London is charming then. Well, I must be off. I'm late. Goodmorning.'We talk him over on the steps as he drives away. He is the type of anaristocrat that must live. He is made of the stuff that marks the truearistocrat. He is an inspiration. He talked just enough, never toomuch. The intonation of his voice and his sense of beauty as heappreciated the dawn stamped him as of the elite--the real elite, notthe Blue Book variety.Loving adventure, virtuous, doing something all the time, and lovingthe doing. What an example he is! He has two stores. This is his firsttruck. He loves it. He is the first of his kind that I have met. Thisis my last night in England. I am glad that it brought me this contactwith real nobility.XV.BON VOYAGEI am off in the morning for Southampton, miserable and depressed.Crowds--the same crowds that saw me come--are there. But they seem abit more desirable. I am leaving them. There are so many things I wishI had done. It is pleasant to be getting this applause on my exit.I do not doubt its sincerity now. It is just as fine and as boisterousas it was when I arrived. They were glad to see me come and are sorryI am going.I feel despondent and sad. I want to hug all of them to me. There issomething so wistful about London, about their kind, gentleappreciation. They smile tenderly as I look this way, that way, overthere--on every side it is the same. They are all my friends and I amleaving them.Will I sign this? A few excited ones are shoving autograph books atme, but most of them are under restraint, almost in repose. They feelthe parting. They sense it, but are sending me away with a smile.My car is full of friends going with me to Southampton. They meanlittle at the moment. The crowd has me. Old, old friends turn up,friends that I have been too busy to see. Faithful old friends who arecontent just to get a glimpse before I leave.There's Freddy Whittaker, an old music-hall artist with whom I onceplayed. Just acquaintances, most of them, but they all knew me, andhad all shared, in spirit, my success. All of them are at the stationand all of them understand. They know that my life has been full everyminute I have been here. There had been so much to do.They knew and understood, yet they had come determined just to see me,if only at the door of my carriage. I feel very sad about them.The train is about to pull out and everything is excitement. Everyoneseems emotional and there is a tenseness in the very atmosphere.'Love to Alf and Amy,' many of them whisper, those who know my managerand his wife. I tell them that I am coming back, perhaps next summer.There is applause. 'Don't forget,' they shout. I don't think I couldforget.The trip to Southampton is not enjoyable. There is a sadness on thetrain. A sort of embarrassed sentimentality among my friends. TomGeraghty is along. Tom is an old American and he is all choked up atthe thought of my going back while he has to stay on in England. Weare going back to his land. We cannot talk much.We go to the boat. Sonny is there to see me off. Sonny, Hetty'sbrother.There is luncheon with my friends and there are crowds of reporters. Ican't be annoyed. There is nothing for me to say. I can't even think.We talk, small talk, joke talk.Sonny is very matter-of-fact. I look at him and wonder if he has everknown. He has always been so vague with me. Has always met me in ajoking way.He leans over and whispers, 'I thought you might like this.' It is apackage. I almost know without asking that it is a picture of Hetty. Iam amazed. He understood all the time. Was always alive to thesituation. How England covers up her feelings!Everybody is off the boat but the passengers. My friends stand on thedock and wave to me. I see everything in their glowing faces--loyalty,love, sadness, a few tears. There is a lump in my throat. I smile justas hard as I can to keep them from seeing. I even smile at thereporters. They're darn nice fellows. I wish I knew them better. Afterall, it's their job to ask questions and they have been merely doingtheir job with me. Just doing their jobs, as they see it. That spiritwould make the world if it were universal.England never looked more lovely. Why didn't I go here? Why didn't Ido this and that? There is so much that I missed. I must come backagain. Will they be glad to see me? As glad as I am to see them? Ihope so. My cheek is damp. I turn away and blot out the sadness. I amnot going to look back again.A sweet little girl about eight years of age, full of laughingchildhood, is coming toward me with a bubbling voice. Her very lookcommands me not to try to escape. I don't think I want to escape fromher.'Oh, Mr. Chaplin,' gurgled the little girl, 'I've been looking for youall over the boat. Please adopt me like you did Jackie Coogan. Wecould smash windows together and have lots of fun. I love your plays.'She takes my hand and looks up into my face. 'They are so clever andbeautiful. Won't you teach me like you taught him? He's so much likeyou. Oh, if I could only be like him.'And with a rapt look on her little face she prattles on, leaving mevery few opportunities to get in a word, though I prefer to listen toher rather than talk.I wave good-bye to my friends and then walk along with her, going upand looking back at the crowd over the rail.Reporters are here. They scent something interesting in my affair withthe little girl. I answer all questions. Then a photographer. We arephotographed together. And the movie men are getting action pictures.We are looking back at my friends on shore.The little girl asks: 'Are they all actors and in the movies? Why areyou so sad? Don't you like leaving England? There will be so manyfriends in America to meet you. Why, you should be so happy becauseyou have friends all over the world!'I tell her that it is just the parting--that the thought of leaving isalways sad. Life is always 'Good-bye.' And here I feel it is good-byeto new friends, that my old ones are in America.We walk around the deck and she discusses the merits of my pictures.'Do you like drama?' I ask.'No. I like to laugh, but I love to make people cry myself. It must benice to act 'cryie' parts, but I don't like to watch them.''And you want me to adopt you?''Only in the pictures, like Jackie. I would love to break windows.'She has dark hair and a beautiful profile of the Spanish type, with adelicately formed nose and a Cupid's bow sort of mouth. Her eyes aresensitive, dark and shining, dancing with life and laughter. As wetalk I notice as she gets serious she grows tender and full ofchildish love.'You like smashing windows! You must be Spanish,' I tell her.'Oh no, not Spanish; I'm Jewish,' she answers.'That accounts for your genius.''Oh, do you think Jewish people are clever?' she asks, eagerly.'Of course. All great geniuses had Jewish blood in them. No, I am notJewish,' as she is about to put that question, 'but I am sure theremust be some somewhere in me. I hope so.''Oh, I am so glad you think them clever. You must meet my mother.She's brilliant and an elocutionist. She recites beautifully, and isso clever at anything. And I am sure you would like my father. Heloves me so much and I think he admires me some, too.'She chatters on as we walk around. Then suddenly. 'You look tired.Please tell me and I will run away.'As the boat is pulling out her mother comes toward us and the childintroduces us with perfect formality and without any embarrassment.She is a fine, cultured person.'Come along, dear, we must go down to the second class. We cannot stayhere.'I make an appointment to lunch with the little girl on the day afterthe morrow, and am already looking forward to it.I spend the greater part of the second day in reading books by FrankHarris, Waldo Frank, Claude McKay, and Major Douglas's 'EconomicDemocracy.'The next day I met Miss Taylor, a famous moving-picture actress ofEngland, and Mr. Hepworth, who is a director of prominence in GreatBritain. Miss Taylor, though sensitive, shy, and retiring, has a greatbit of charm.They are making their first trip to America, and we soon become goodfriends. We discuss the characteristics of the American people,contrasting their youthful, frank abruptness with the quiet, shy, andreserved Britisher.I find myself running wild as I tell them of this land. I explaintrain hold-ups, advertising signs, Broadway lights, blatant theatres,ticket speculators, subways, the automat and its big sister, thecafeteria. It has a great effect on my friends and at times I almostdetect unbelief. I find myself wanting to show the whole thing to themand to watch their reactions.At luncheon next day the little girl is the soul of the party. Wediscuss everything from Art to ambitions. At one moment she is full ofmusical laughter, and the next she is excitedly discussing somehappening aboard ship. Her stories are always interesting. How dochildren see so much more than grown-ups?She has a great time. I must visit her father, he is so much like me.He has the same temperament, and is such a great daddy. He is so goodto her. And she rattles on without stopping.Then again she thinks I may be tired. 'Sit back now.' And she puts apillow behind my head and bids me rest.These moments with her make days aboard pass quickly and pleasantly.Carl Robinson and I are strolling around the top deck the next day inan effort to get away from everyone, and I notice someone looking upat a wire running between the funnels of the ship. Perched on the wireis a little bird, and I am wondering how it got there and if it hadbeen there since we left England.The other watcher notices us. He turns and smiles. 'The little birdmust think this is the promised land.'I knew at once that he was somebody. Those thoughts belong only topoets. Later in the evening he joins us at my invitation and I learnhe is Easthope Martin, the composer and pianist. He had been throughthe War and it had left its stamp on this fine, sensitive soul. He hadbeen gassed. I could not imagine such a man in the trenches.He is very frail of body, and as he talks I always imagine his bigsoul at the bursting point with a pent-up yearning.There is the inevitable concert on the last night of the voyage. Weare off the banks of Newfoundland, and in the midst of a fog. Foghorns must be kept blowing at intervals, hence the effect on theconcert, particularly the vocal part, is obvious.We land at seven in the morning of a very windy day, and it is elevenbefore we can get away. Reporters and camera men fill the air duringall that time, and I am rather glad, because it shows Miss Taylor andMr. Hepworth a glimpse of what America is like. We arrange to meetthat night at Sam Goldwyn's for dinner.Good-byes here are rather joyous, because we are all getting off inthe same land and there will be an opportunity to see one anotheragain.My little friend comes to me excitedly and gives me a present--asilver stamp box. 'I hope that when you write your first letter youtake a stamp from here and mail it to me. Good-bye.'She shakes hands. We are real lovers and must be careful. She tells menot to overwork. 'Don't forget to come and see us; you must meetdaddy. Good-bye, Charlie.'She curtsies and is gone. I go to my cabin to wait until we can land.There is a tiny knock. She comes in.'Charlie, I couldn't kiss you out there in front of all those people.Good-bye, dear. Take care of yourself.' This is real love. She kissesmy cheek and then runs out on deck.Easthope Martin is with us that night at Goldwyn's party. He plays oneof his own compositions and holds us spellbound. He is very gratefulfor our sincere applause and quite retiring and unassuming, though heis the hit of the evening.Following the dinner I carried the English movie folk on asight-seeing trip, enjoying their amazement at the wonders of a NewYork night.'What do you think of it?' I asked them.'Thrilling,' says Hepworth. 'I like it. There is something electricalin the air. It is a driving force. You must do things.'We go to a cafe, where the elite of New York are gathered, and danceuntil midnight. I bid them good-bye, hoping to meet them later whenthey come to Los Angeles.I dine at Max Eastman's the next night and meet McKay, the negro poet.He is quite handsome, a full-blooded Jamaican negro not more thantwenty-five years of age. I can readily see why he has been termed anAfrican prince. He has just that manner.I have read a number of his poems. He is a true aristocrat with thesensitiveness of a poet and the humour of a philosopher, and quiteshy. In fact, he is rather supersensitive, but with a dignity andmanner that seem to hold him aloof.There are many other friends there, and we discuss Max's new book onhumour. There is a controversy whether to call it 'Sense of Humour' or'Psychology of Humour.' We talk about my trip. Claude McKay asks if Imet Shaw. 'Too bad,' he says. 'You would like him and he would haveenjoyed you.'I am interested in Claude. 'How do you write your poetry? Can you makeyourself write? Do you prepare?' I try to discuss his race. 'What istheir future? Do they----'He shrugs his shoulders. I realise he is a poet, an aristocrat.I dine the next evening with Waldo Frank and Marguerite Naumberg andwe discuss her new system. She has a school that develops childrenalong the lines of personality. It is a study in individuality. Sheis struggling alone, but is getting wonderful results. We talk farinto the morning on everything, including the fourth dimension.Next day Frank Harris calls and we decide to take a trip to Sing Singtogether. Frank is very sad and wistful. He is anxious to get awayfrom New York and devote time to his autobiography before it is toolate. He has so much to say that he wants to write it while it iskeen.I try to tell him that consciousness of age is a sign of keenness.That age doesn't bother the mind.We discuss George Meredith and a wonderful book he had written. Andthen in his age Meredith had rewritten it. He said it was so muchbetter rewritten, but he had taken from it all the red blood. It wasold, withered like himself. You can't see things as they were.Meredith had become old. Harris says he doesn't want the sameexperience.All this on the way to Sing Sing. Frank is a wonderfulconversationalist. Like his friend Oscar Wilde. That same charm andbrilliancy of wit, ever ready for argument. What a fund of knowledgehe has. What a biography his should be. If it is just half as good asWilde's, it will be sufficient.Sing Sing. The big, grey stone buildings seem to me like an outcryagainst civilisation. This huge grey monster with its thousand staringeyes. We are in the visiting room. Young men in grey shirts. ThankGod, the hideous stripes are gone. This is progress, humanity. It isnot so stark.There is a mite of a baby holding her daddy's hand and playing withhis hair as he talks with her mamma, his wife. Another prisonerholding two withered hands of an old lady. Mother was written all overher, though neither said a word. I felt brutal at witnessing theiremotion.All of them old. Children, widows, mothers--youth crossed out of facesby lines of suffering and life's penalties. Tragedy and sadness, andalways it is in the faces of the women that the suffering is moreplainly written. The men suffer in body--the women in soul.The men look resigned. Their spirit is gone. What is it that happensbehind these grey walls that kills so completely?The devotion of the prisoners is almost childish in its eagerness asthey sit with their children, talking with their wives, here and therea lover with his sweetheart--all of them have written a compellingstory in the book of life. But love is in this room, love unashamed.Why are sinners always loved? Why do sinners make such wonderfullovers? Perhaps it is compensation, as they call it. Love is paged byevery eye here.Children are playing around the floor. Their laughter is like abenediction. This is another improvement, this room. There are nolonger bars to separate loved ones. Human nature improves, but thetragedy remains just as dramatic.The cells where they sleep are old-fashioned, built by a monster or amaniac. No architect could do such a thing for human beings. They arebuilt of hate, ignorance, and stupidity. I understand they arebuilding a new prison, more sane, with far more understanding of humanneeds. Until then these poor wretches must endure these awful cells.I'd go mad there.I notice quite a bit of freedom. A number of prisoners are strollingaround the grounds while others are at work. The honour system is agreat thing, gives a man a chance to hold self-respect.They have heard that I am coming, and most of them seem to know me. Iam embarrassed. What can I say? How can I approach them? I wave myhand merely. 'Hello, folks!'I decide to discard conversation. Be myself. Be comic. Cut up. I twistmy cane and juggle my hat. I kick up my leg in back. I am on comicground. That's the thing.No sentiment, no slopping over, no morals--they are fed up with that.What is there in common between us? Our viewpoints are entirelydifferent. They're in--I'm out.They show me a cup presented by Sir Thomas Lipton, inscribed, 'We haveall made mistakes.''How do we know but what some of you haven't?' I ask, humorously. Itmakes a hit. They want me to talk.'Brother criminals and fellow sinners: Christ said, 'Let him who iswithout sin cast the first stone.' I cannot cast the stone, though Ihave compromised and thrown many a pie. But I cannot cast the firststone.' Some got it. Others never will.We must be sensible. I am not a hero worshipper of criminals and badmen. Society must be protected. We are greater in number than thecriminals and have the upper hand. We must keep it; but we can atleast treat them intelligently, for, after all, crime is the outcomeof society.The doctor tells me that but a few of them are criminals fromheredity, that the majority had been forced into crime bycircumstances or had committed it in passion. I notice a lot ofevil-looking men, but also some splendid ones. I earnestly believethat society can protect itself intelligently, humanly. I wouldabolish prisons. Call them hospitals and treat the prisoners aspatients.It is a problem that I make no pretence of solving.The death house. It is hideous. A plain, bare room, rather large andwith a white door, not green, as I have been told. The chair--a plainwooden armchair and a single wire coming down over it. This is aninstrument to snuff out life. It is too simple. It is not evendramatic. Just cold-blooded and matter of fact.Some one is telling me how they watch the prisoner after he isstrapped in the chair. Good God! How can they calmly plan with suchexactness? And they have killed as many as seven in one day. I mustget out.Two men were walking up and down in a bare yard, one a short man witha pipe in his mouth, walking briskly, and at his side a warden. Thekeeper announces, shortly, 'The next for the chair.'How awful! Looking straight in front of him and coming toward us, Isaw his face. Tragic and appalling. I will see it for a long time.We visit the industries. There is something ironical about theirlocation with the mountains for a background, but the effect is good,they can get a sense of freedom. A good system here, with the wardenstolerant. They seem to understand. I whisper to one.'Is Jim Larkin here?' He is in the boot department, and we go to seehim for a moment. There is a rule against it, but on this occasion therule is waived.Larkin struts up. Large, about six feet two inches, a fine, strappingIrishman. Introduced, he talks timidly.He can't stay, mustn't leave his work. Is happy. Only worried abouthis wife and children in Ireland. Anxious about them, otherwise fit.There are four more years for him. He seems deserted even by hisparty, though there is an effort being made to have his sentencerepealed. After all, he is no ordinary criminal. Just a political one.He asks about my reception in England. 'Glad to meet you, but I mustget back.'Frank tells him he will help to get his release. He smiles, gripsFrank's hand hard. 'Thanks.' Harris tells me he is a cultured man anda fine writer.But the prison marked him. The buoyancy and spirit that must have gonewith those Irish eyes are no more. Those same eyes are now wistful,where they once were gay. He hasn't been forgotten. Our visit hashelped. There may be a bit of hope left to him.We go to the solitary-confinement cell, where trouble makers are kept.'This young man tried to escape, got out on the roof. We went afterhim,' says the warden.'Yes, it was quite a movie stunt,' said the youngster. He isembarrassed. We try to relieve it.'Whatever he's done, he's darn handsome,' I tell the warden. It helps.'Better luck next time,' I tell him. He laughs. 'Thanks. Pleased tomeet you, Charlie.'He is just nineteen, handsome and healthy. What a pity! The greatesttragedy of all. He is a forger, here with murderers.We leave and I look back at the prison just once. Why are prisons andgraveyards built in such beautiful places?Next day everything is bustling, getting ready for the trip back toLos Angeles. I sneak out in the excitement and go to a matinee to seeMarie Doro in 'Lilies of the Field,' and that night to 'The Hero,' asplendid play. A young actor, Robert Ames, I believe, gives the finestperformance I have ever seen in America.We are on the way. I am rushing back with the swiftness of theTwentieth Century Limited. There is a wire from my studio manager.'When will I be back for work?' I wire him that I am rushing andanxious to get there. There is a brief stop in Chicago and then we areon again.And as the train rushes me back I am living again this vacation ofmine. Its every moment now seems wonderful. The petty annoyances werebut seasoning. I even begin to like reporters. They are regularfellows, intent on their job.And going over it all, it has been so worth while and the job ahead ofme looks worth while. If I can bring smiles to the tired eyes inKennington and Whitechapel, if I have absorbed and understood thevirtues and problems of those simpler people I have met, and if I havegathered the least bit of inspiration from those greater personageswho were kind to me, then this has been a wonderful trip, and somehowI am eager to get back to work and begin paying for it.I notice a newspaper headline as I write. It tells of the Conferencefor Disarmament. Is it prophetic? Does it mean that War will neverstride through the world again? Is it a gleam of intelligence cominginto the world?We are arriving at Ogden, Utah, as I write. There is a telegram askingme to dine with Clare Sheridan on my arrival in Los Angeles. Theprospect is most alluring. And that wire, with several others,convinces me that I am getting home.I turn again to the newspaper. My holiday is over. I reflect ondisarmament. I wonder what will be the answer? I hope and am inclinedto believe that it will be for good. Was it Tennyson who wrote:         When shall all men's good     Be each man's rule, and universal peace     Shine like a shaft of light across the lane,     And like a layer of beams athwart the sea?What a beautiful thought! Can those who go to Washington make it morethan a thought?The conductor is calling:'Los Angeles.''Bye.'THE END.
ISFJ	 I.Childhood and Early Impressions.  The Blessing of Pious Parents.Desire of Martyrdom.  Death of the Saint's Mother.1. I had a father and mother, who were devout and feared God.Our Lord also helped me with His grace.  All this would have beenenough to make me good, if I had not been so wicked.  My fatherwas very much given to the reading of good books; and so he hadthem in Spanish, that his children might read them.  These books,with my mother's carefulness to make us say our prayers, and tobring us up devout to our Lady and to certain Saints, began tomake me think seriously when I was, I believe, six or seven yearsold.  It helped me, too, that I never saw my father and motherrespect anything but goodness.  They were very good themselves.My father was a man of great charity towards the poor, andcompassion for the sick, and also for servants; so much so, thathe never could be persuaded to keep slaves, for he pitied them somuch: and a slave belonging to one of his brothers being once inhis house, was treated by him with as much tenderness as his ownchildren.  He used to say that he could not endure the pain ofseeing that she was not free.  He was a man of greattruthfulness; nobody ever heard him swear or speak ill of anyone; his life was most pure.2. My mother also was a woman of great goodness, and her life wasspent in great infirmities.  She was singularly pure in all herways.  Though possessing great beauty, yet was it never knownthat she gave reason to suspect that she made any accountwhatever of it; for, though she was only three-and-thirty yearsof age when she died, her apparel was already that of a womanadvanced in years.  She was very calm, and had great sense.The sufferings she went through during her life were grievous,her death most Christian. [1]3. We were three sisters and nine brothers. [2]  All, by themercy of God, resembled their parents in goodness except myself,though I was the most cherished of my father.  And, before Ibegan to offend God, I think he had some reason,--for I am filledwith sorrow whenever I think of the good desires with which ourLord inspired me, and what a wretched use I made of them.Besides, my brothers never in any way hindered me in the serviceof God.4. One of my brothers was nearly of my own age; [3] and he it waswhom I most loved, though I was very fond of them all, and theyof me.  He and I used to read Lives of Saints together.  When Iread of martyrdom undergone by the Saints for the love of God, itstruck me that the vision of God was very cheaply purchased; andI had a great desire to die a martyr's death,--not out of anylove of Him of which I was conscious, but that I might mostquickly attain to the fruition of those great joys of which Iread that they were reserved in Heaven; and I used to discusswith my brother how we could become martyrs.  We settled to gotogether to the country of the Moors, [4] begging our way for thelove of God, that we might be there beheaded; [5] and our Lord, Ibelieve, had given us courage enough, even at so tender an age,if we could have found the means to proceed; but our greatestdifficulty seemed to be our father and mother.5. It astonished us greatly to find it said in what we werereading that pain and bliss were everlasting.  We happened veryoften to talk about this; and we had a pleasure in repeatingfrequently, 'For ever, ever, ever.'  Through the constantuttering of these words, our Lord was pleased that I shouldreceive an abiding impression of the way of truth when I was yeta child.6. As soon as I saw it was impossible to go to any place wherepeople would put me to death for the sake of God, my brother andI set about becoming hermits; and in an orchard belonging to thehouse we contrived, as well as we could, to build hermitages, bypiling up small stones one on the other, which fell downimmediately; and so it came to pass that we found no means ofaccomplishing our wish.  Even now, I have a feeling of devotionwhen I consider how God gave me in my early youth what I lost bymy own fault.  I gave alms as I could--and I could but little.I contrived to be alone, for the sake of saying myprayers [6]--and they were many--especially the Rosary, to whichmy mother had a great devotion, and had made us also in this likeherself.  I used to delight exceedingly, when playing with otherchildren, in the building of monasteries, as if we were nuns; andI think I wished to be a nun, though not so much as I did to be amartyr or a hermit.7. I remember that, when my mother died, [7] I was about twelveyears old--a little less.  When I began to understand my loss, Iwent in my affliction to an image of our Lady, [8] and with manytears implored her to be my mother.  I did this in my simplicity,and I believe that it was of service to me; for I have byexperience found the royal Virgin help me whenever I recommendedmyself to her; and at last she has brought me back to herself.It distresses me now, when I think of, and reflect on, that whichkept me from being earnest in the good desires with whichI began.8. O my Lord, since Thou art determined to save me--may it be thepleasure of Thy Majesty to effect it!--and to bestow upon me somany graces, why has it not been Thy pleasure also--not for myadvantage, but for Thy greater honour--that this habitation,wherein Thou hast continually to dwell, should not havecontracted so much defilement?  It distresses me even to saythis, O my Lord, because I know the fault is all my own, seeingthat Thou hast left nothing undone to make me, even from myyouth, wholly Thine.  When I would complain of my parents, Icannot do it; for I saw nothing in them but all good, andcarefulness for my welfare.  Then, growing up, I began todiscover the natural gifts which our Lord had given me--they weresaid to be many; and, when I should have given Him thanks forthem, I made use of every one of them, as I shall now explain, tooffend Him.1. See ch. xxxvii. § 1; where the Saint says that she saw them ina vision both in Heaven.2. Alfonso Sanchez de Cepeda, father of the Saint, married firstCatalina del Peso y Henao, and had three children--one daughter,Maria de Cepeda, and two sons.  After the death of Catalina, hemarried Beatriz Davila y Ahumada, by whom he had ninechildren--seven boys and two girls.  The third of these, and theeldest of the daughters, was the Saint, Doña Teresa SanchezCepeda Davila y Ahumada.  In the Monastery of the Incarnation,where she was a professed nun for twenty-eight years, she wasknown as Doña Teresa; but in the year 1563, when she left hermonastery for the new foundation of St. Joseph, of the Reform ofthe Carmelites, she took for the first time the name of Teresa ofJesus (De la Fuente).  The Saint was born March 28, 1515, andbaptized on the 4th of April, in the church of St. John; on whichday Mass was said for the first time in the Monastery of theIncarnation, where the Saint made her profession.  Her godfatherwas Vela Nuñez, and her godmother Doña Maria del Aguila.The Bollandists and Father Bouix say that she was baptized on thevery day of her birth.  But the testimony of Doña Maria de Pinel,a nun in the Monastery of the Incarnation, is clear: and DonVicente de La Fuente, quoting it, vol. i. p. 549, says that thisdelay of baptism was nothing singular in those days, providedthere was no danger of death.3. Rodrigo de Cepeda, four years older than the Saint, enteredthe army, and, serving in South America, was drowned in the riverPlate, Rio de la Plata.  St. Teresa always considered him amartyr, because he died in defence of the Catholic faith (Ribera,lib. i. ch. iii.).  Before he sailed for the Indies, he made hiswill, and left all his property to the Saint, his sister (Reformade los Descalços, vol. i. lib. i. ch. iii. § 4).4. The Bollandists incline to believe that St. Teresa may nothave intended to quit Spain, because all the Moors were not atthat time driven out of the country.  The Bull of the Saint'scanonization, and the Lections of the Breviary, say that she lefther father's house, ut in Africam trajiceret.5. The two children set out on their strange journey--one of themseven, the other eleven, years old--through the Adaja Gate; butwhen they had crossed the bridge, they were met by one of theiruncles, who brought them back to their mother, who had alreadysent through Avila in quest of them.  Rodrigo, like Adam, excusedhimself, and laid the blame on the woman (Ribera,lib. i. ch. iii.).  Francisco de Santa Maria, chronicler of theOrder, says that the uncle was Francisco Alvarez de Cepeda(Reforma de los Descalços, lib. i. ch. v. § 4).6. She was also marvellously touched by the story of theSamaritan woman at the well, of whom there was a picture in herroom (Ribera, lib. i. ch. iv.).  She speaks of this later on.(See ch. xxx. § 24.)7. The last will and testament of Doña Beatriz de Ahumada wasmade November 24, 1528 and she may have died soon after.If there be no mistake in the copy of that instrument, the Saintmust have been more than twelve years old at that time.Don Vicente, in a note, says, with the Bollandists, that DoñaBeatriz died at the end of the year 1526, or in the beginning of1527; but it is probable that, when he wrote that note, he hadnot read the copy of the will, which he has printed in the firstvolume of the Saint's writings, p. 550.8. Our Lady of Charity, in the church of the hospital wherethe poor and pilgrims were received in Avila (Bouix).
ISFJ	 II.Early Impressions.  Dangerous Books and Companions.  The Saint IsPlaced in a Monastery.1. What I shall now speak of was, I believe, the beginning ofgreat harm to me.  I often think how wrong it is of parents notto be very careful that their children should always, and inevery way, see only that which is good; for though my mother was,as I have just said, so good herself, nevertheless I, when I cameto the use of reason, did not derive so much good from her as Iought to have done--almost none at all; and the evil I learneddid me much harm.  She was very fond of books of chivalry; butthis pastime did not hurt her so much as it hurt me, because shenever wasted her time on them; only we, her children, were leftat liberty to read them; and perhaps she did this to distract herthoughts from her great sufferings, and occupy her children, thatthey might not go astray in other ways.  It annoyed my father somuch, that we had to be careful he never saw us.  I contracted ahabit of reading these books; and this little fault which Iobserved in my mother was the beginning of lukewarmness in mygood desires, and the occasion of my falling away in otherrespects.  I thought there was no harm in it when I wasted manyhours night and day in so vain an occupation, even when I kept ita secret from my father.  So completely was I mastered by thispassion, that I thought I could never be happy without anew book.2. I began to make much of dress, to wish to please others by myappearance.  I took pains with my hands and my hair, usedperfumes, and all vanities within my reach--and they were many,for I was very much given to them.  I had no evil intention,because I never wished any one to offend God for me.This fastidiousness of excessive neatness [1] lasted some years;and so also did other practices, which I thought then were not atall sinful; now, I see how wrong all this must have been.3. I had some cousins; for into my father's house no others wereallowed an entrance.  In this he was very cautious; and would toGod he had been cautious about them!--for I see now the danger ofconversing, at an age when virtue should begin to grow, withpersons who, knowing nothing themselves of the vanity of theworld, provoke others to throw themselves into the midst of it.These cousins were nearly of mine own age--a little older,perhaps.  We were always together; and they had a great affectionfor me.  In everything that gave them pleasure, I kept theconversation alive,--listened to the stories of their affectionsand childish follies, good for nothing; and, what was stillworse, my soul began to give itself up to that which was thecause of all its disorders.  If I were to give advice, I wouldsay to parents that they ought to be very careful whom they allowto mix with their children when young; for much mischief thenceensues, and our natural inclinations are unto evil rather thanunto good.4. So it was with me; for I had a sister much older thanmyself, [2] from whose modesty and goodness, which were great, Ilearned nothing; and learned every evil from a relative who wasoften in the house.  She was so light and frivolous, that mymother took great pains to keep her out of the house, as if sheforesaw the evil I should learn from her; but she could notsucceed, there being so many reasons for her coming.  I was veryfond of this person's company, gossiped and talked with her; forshe helped me in all the amusements I liked, and, what is more,found some for me, and communicated to me her own conversationsand her vanities.  Until I knew her, I mean, until she becamefriendly with me, and communicated to me her own affairs--I wasthen about fourteen years old, a little more, I think--I do notbelieve that I turned away from God in mortal sin, or lost thefear of Him, though I had a greater fear of disgrace.This latter fear had such sway over me, that I never whollyforfeited my good name--and, as to that, there was nothing in theworld for which I would have bartered it, and nobody in the worldI liked well enough who could have persuaded me to do it.  Thus Imight have had the strength never to do anything against thehonour of God, as I had it by nature not to fail in that whereinI thought the honour of the world consisted; and I never observedthat I was failing in many other ways.  In vainly seeking afterit I was extremely careful; but in the use of the means necessaryfor preserving it I was utterly careless. I was anxious only notto be lost altogether.5. This friendship distressed my father and sister exceedingly.They often blamed me for it; but, as they could not hinder thatperson from coming into the house, all their efforts were invain; for I was very adroit in doing anything that was wrong.Now and then, I am amazed at the evil one bad companion cando,--nor could I believe it if I did not know it byexperience,--especially when we are young: then is it that theevil must be greatest.  Oh, that parents would take warning byme, and look carefully to this! So it was; the conversation ofthis person so changed me, that no trace was left of my soul'snatural disposition to virtue, and I became a reflection of herand of another who was given to the same kind of amusements.6. I know from this the great advantage of good companions; and Iam certain that if at that tender age I had been thrown amonggood people, I should have persevered in virtue; for if at thattime I had found any one to teach me the fear of God, my soulwould have grown strong enough not to fall away. Afterwards, whenthe fear of God had utterly departed from me, the fear ofdishonour alone remained, and was a torment to me in all I did.When I thought that nobody would ever know, I ventured upon manythings that were neither honourable nor pleasing unto God.7. In the beginning, these conversations did me harm--I believeso.  The fault was perhaps not hers, but mine; for afterwards myown wickedness was enough to lead me astray, together with theservants about me, whom I found ready enough for all evil.If any one of these had given me good advice, I might perhapshave profited by it; but they were blinded by interest, as I wasby passion.  Still, I was never inclined to much evil,--for Ihated naturally anything dishonourable,--but only to theamusement of a pleasant conversation.  The occasion of sin,however, being present, danger was at hand, and I exposed to itmy father and brothers.  God delivered me out of it all, so thatI should not be lost, in a manner visibly against my will, yetnot so secretly as to allow me to escape without the loss of mygood name and the suspicions of my father.8. I had not spent, I think, three months in these vanities, whenthey took me to a monastery [3] in the city where I lived, inwhich children like myself were brought up, though their way oflife was not so wicked as mine.  This was done with the utmostconcealment of the true reason, which was known only to myselfand one of my kindred.  They waited for an opportunity whichwould make the change seem nothing out of the way; for, as mysister was married, it was not fitting I should remain alone,without a mother, in the house.9. So excessive was my father's love for me, and so deep mydissembling, that he never would believe me to be so wicked as Iwas; and hence I was never in disgrace with him.  Though someremarks were made, yet, as the time had been short, nothing couldbe positively asserted; and, as I was so much afraid about mygood name, I had taken every care to be secret; and yet I neverconsidered that I could conceal nothing from Him Who seeth allthings.  O my God, what evil is done in the world by disregardingthis, and thinking that anything can be kept secret that is doneagainst Thee!  I am quite certain that great evils would beavoided if we clearly understood that what we have to do is, notto be on our guard against men, but on our guard againstdispleasing Thee.10. For the first eight days, I suffered much; but more from thesuspicion that my vanity was known, than from being in themonastery; for I was already weary of myself--and, though Ioffended God, I never ceased to have a great fear of Him, andcontrived to go to confession as quickly as I could.  I was veryuncomfortable; but within eight days, I think sooner, I was muchmore contented than I had been in my father's house.  All thenuns were pleased with me; for our Lord had given me the grace toplease every one, wherever I might be.  I was therefore made muchof in the monastery.  Though at this time I hated to be a nun,yet I was delighted at the sight of nuns so good; for they werevery good in that house--very prudent, observant of the rule,and recollected.11. Yet, for all this, the devil did not cease to tempt me; andpeople in the world sought means to trouble my rest with messagesand presents.  As this could not be allowed, it was soon over,and my soul began to return to the good habits of my earlieryears; and I recognized the great mercy of God to those whom Heplaces among good people.  It seems as if His Majesty had soughtand sought again how to convert me to Himself.  Blessed be Thou,O Lord, for having borne with me so long!  Amen.12. Were it not for my many faults, there was some excuse for me,I think, in this: that the conversation I shared in was with onewho, I thought, would do well in the estate of matrimony; [4] andI was told by my confessors, and others also, whom in many pointsI consulted, used to say, that I was not offending God.  One ofthe nuns [5] slept with us who were seculars, and through her itpleased our Lord to give me light, as I shall now explain.1. The Saint throughout her life was extremely careful ofcleanliness.  In one of her letters to Father Jerome Gratian ofthe Mother of God (No. 323, Letter 28, vol. iii. ed. Doblado),she begs him, for the love of God, to see that the Fathers hadclean cells and table; and the Ven. Mother Anne ofSt. Bartholomew, in her life (Bruxelles, 1708, p. 40), says thatshe changed the Saint's linen on the day of her death, and wasthanked by her for her carefulness.  'Her soul was so pure,' saysthe Ven. Mother, 'that she could not bear anything that wasnot clean.'2. Maria de Cepeda, half-sister of the Saint.  She was married toDon Martin de Guzman y Barrientos; and the contract for the dowrywas signed January 11, 1531 (Reforma de los Descalçoslib. i. ch. vii. § 4).3. The Augustinian Monastery of Our Lady of Grace.  It wasfounded in 1509 by the venerable Fra Juan of Seville,Vicar-General of the Order (Reforma de los Descalçoslib. i. ch. vii. n. 2).  There were forty nuns in the house atthis time (De la Fuente).4. Some have said that the Saint at this time intended, orwished, to be married; and Father Bouix translates the passagethus: 'une alliance honorable pour moi.'  But it is more probablethat the Saint had listened only to the story of her cousin'sintended marriage; for in ch. v. § 11, she says that our Lord hadalways kept her from seeking to be loved of men.5. Doña Maria Brizeño, mistress of the secular children who wereeducated in the monastery (Reforma, lib. i. ch. vii. § 3).
ISFJ	 III.The Blessing of Being with Good People.  How Certain IllusionsWere Removed.1. I began gradually to like the good and holy conversation ofthis nun.  How well she used to speak of God! for she was aperson of great discretion and sanctity.  I listened to her withdelight.  I think there never was a time when I was not glad tolisten to her.  She began by telling me how she came to be a nunthrough the mere reading of the words of the Gospel 'Many arecalled, and few are chosen.' [1]  She would speak of the rewardwhich our Lord gives to those who forsake all things for Hissake.  This good companionship began to root out the habits whichbad companionship had formed, and to bring my thoughts back tothe desire of eternal things, as well as to banish in somemeasure the great dislike I had to be a nun, which had been verygreat; and if I saw any one weep in prayer, or devout in anyother way, I envied her very much; for my heart was now so hard,that I could not shed a tear, even if I read the Passion through.This was a grief to me.2. I remained in the monastery a year and a half, and was verymuch the better for it.  I began to say many vocal prayers, andto ask all the nuns to pray for me, that God would place me inthat state wherein I was to serve Him; but, for all this, Iwished not to be a nun, and that God would not be pleased Ishould be one, though at the same time I was afraid of marriage.At the end of my stay there, I had a greater inclination to be anun, yet not in that house, on account of certain devotionalpractices which I understood prevailed there, and which I thoughtoverstrained.  Some of the younger ones encouraged me in this mywish; and if all had been of one mind, I might have profited byit.  I had also a great friend [2] in another monastery; and thismade me resolve, if I was to be a nun, not to be one in any otherhouse than where she was.  I looked more to the pleasure of senseand vanity than to the good of my soul.  These good thoughts ofbeing a nun came to me from time to time.  They left me verysoon; and I could not persuade myself to become one.3. At this time, though I was not careless about my own good, ourLord was much more careful to dispose me for that state of lifewhich was best for me.  He sent me a serious illness, so that Iwas obliged to return to my father's house.4. When I became well again, they took me to see my sister [3] inher house in the country village where she dwelt. Her love for mewas so great, that, if she had had her will, I should never haveleft her.  Her husband also had a great affection for me--atleast, he showed me all kindness.  This too I owe rather to ourLord, for I have received kindness everywhere; and all my servicein return is, that I am what I am.5. On the road lived a brother of my father [4]--a prudent andmost excellent man, then a widower.  Him too our Lord waspreparing for Himself.  In his old age, he left all hispossessions and became a religious.  He so finished his course,that I believe him to have the vision of God.  He would have mestay with him some days.  His practice was to read good books inSpanish; and his ordinary conversation was about God and thevanity of the world.  These books he made me read to him; and,though I did not much like them, I appeared as if I did; for ingiving pleasure to others I have been most particular, though itmight be painful to myself--so much so, that what in others mighthave been a virtue was in me a great fault, because I was oftenextremely indiscreet.  O my God, in how many ways did His Majestyprepare me for the state wherein it was His will I should serveHim!--how, against my own will, He constrained me to do violenceto myself!  May He be blessed for ever!  Amen.6. Though I remained here but a few days, yet, through theimpression made on my heart by the words of God both heard andread, and by the good conversation of my uncle, I came tounderstand the truth I had heard in my childhood, that all thingsare as nothing, the world vanity, and passing rapidly away.I also began to be afraid that, if I were then to die, I shouldgo down to hell.  Though I could not bend my will to be a nun, Isaw that the religious state was the best and the safest.And thus, by little and little, I resolved to force myselfinto it.7. The struggle lasted three months.  I used to press this reasonagainst myself: The trials and sufferings of living as a nuncannot be greater than those of purgatory, and I have welldeserved to be in hell.  It is not much to spend the rest of mylife as if I were in purgatory, and then go straight toHeaven--which was what I desired.  I was more influenced byservile fear, I think, than by love, to enter religion.8. The devil put before me that I could not endure the trials ofthe religious life, because of my delicate nurture.  I defendedmyself against him by alleging the trials which Christ endured,and that it was not much for me to suffer something for His sake;besides, He would help me to bear it.  I must have thought so,but I do not remember this consideration.  I endured manytemptations during these days.  I was subject to fainting-fits,attended with fever,--for my health was always weak.  I hadbecome by this time fond of good books, and that gave me life.I read the Epistles of St. Jerome, which filled me with so muchcourage, that I resolved to tell my father of my purpose,--whichwas almost like taking the habit; for I was so jealous of myword, that I would never, for any consideration, recede from apromise when once my word had been given.9. My father's love for me was so great, that I could neverobtain his consent; nor could the prayers of others, whom Ipersuaded to speak to him, be of any avail.  The utmost I couldget from him was that I might do as I pleased after his death.I now began to be afraid of myself, and of my own weakness--for Imight go back.  So, considering that such waiting was not safefor me, I obtained my end in another way, as I shall now relate.1. St. Matt. xx. 16: 'Multi enim sunt vocati, pauci vero electi.'2. Juana Suarez, in the Monastery of the incarnation, Avila(Reforma, lib. i. ch. vii. § 7).3. Maria de Cepeda, married to Don Martin Guzman y Barrientos.They lived in Castellanos de la Cañada, where they hadconsiderable property; but in the later years of their lives theywere in straitened circumstances (De la Fuente).

ISFJ	 IV.Our Lord Helps Her to Become a Nun.  Her Many Infirmities.1. In those days, when I was thus resolved, I had persuaded oneof my brothers, [1] by speaking to him of the vanity of theworld, to become a friar; and we agreed together to set out oneday very early in the morning for the monastery where that friendof mine lived for whom I had so great an affection: [2] though Iwould have gone to any other monastery, if I thought I shouldserve God better in it, or to any one my father liked, so strongwas my resolution now to become a nun--for I thought more of thesalvation of my soul now, and made no account whatever of mineown ease.  I remember perfectly well, and it is quite true, thatthe pain I felt when I left my father's house was so great, thatI do not believe the pain of dying will be greater--for it seemedto me as if every bone in my body were wrenched asunder; [3] for,as I had no love of God to destroy my love of father and ofkindred, this latter love came upon me with a violence so greatthat, if our Lord had not been my keeper, my own resolution to goon would have failed me.  But He gave me courage to fight againstmyself, so that I executed my purpose. [4]2. When I took the habit, [5] our Lord at once made me understandhow He helps those who do violence to themselves in order toserve Him.  No one observed this violence in me; they saw nothingbut the greatest good will.  At that moment, because I wasentering on that state, I was filled with a joy so great, that ithas never failed me to this day; and God converted the aridity ofmy soul into the greatest tenderness.  Everything in religion wasa delight unto me; and it is true that now and then I used tosweep the house during those hours of the day which I hadformerly spent on my amusements and my dress; and, calling tomind that I was delivered from such follies, I was filled with anew joy that surprised me, nor could I understand whence it came.3. Whenever I remember this, there is nothing in the world,however hard it may be, that, if it were proposed to me, I wouldnot undertake without any hesitation whatever; for I know now, byexperience in many things, that if from the first I resolutelypersevere in my purpose, even in this life His Majesty rewards itin a way which he only understands who has tried it.  When theact is done for God only, it is His will before we begin it thatthe soul, in order to the increase of its merits, should beafraid; and the greater the fear, if we do but succeed, thegreater the reward, and the sweetness thence afterwardsresulting.  I know this by experience, as I have just said, inmany serious affairs; and so, if I were a person who had toadvise anybody, I would never counsel any one, to whom goodinspirations from time to time may come, to resist them throughfear of the difficulty of carrying them into effect; for if aperson lives detached for the love of God only, that is no reasonfor being afraid of failure, for He is omnipotent.  May He beblessed for ever!  Amen.4. O supreme Good, and my Rest, those graces ought to have beenenough which Thou hadst given me hitherto, seeing that Thycompassion and greatness had drawn me through so many windings toa state so secure, to a house where there are so many servants ofGod, from whom I might learn how I may advance in Thy service.I know not how to go on, when I call to mind the circumstances ofmy profession, the great resolution and joy with which I made it,and my betrothal unto Thee.  I cannot speak of it without tears;and my tears ought to be tears of blood, my heart ought to break,and that would not be much to suffer because of the many offencesagainst Thee which I have committed since that day.  It seems tome now that I had good reasons for not wishing for this dignity,seeing that I have made so sad a use of it.  But Thou, O my Lord,hast been willing to bear with me for almost twenty years of myevil using of Thy graces, till I might become better.  It seemsto me, O my God, that I did nothing but promise never to keep anyof the promises then made to Thee.  Yet such was not myintention: but I see that what I have done since is of such anature, that I know not what my intention was.  So it was and soit happened, that it may be the better known, O my Bridegroom,Who Thou art and what I am.5. It is certainly true that very frequently the joy I have inthat the multitude of Thy mercies is made known in me, softensthe bitter sense of my great faults.  In whom, O Lord, can theyshine forth as they do in me, who by my evil deeds have shroudedin darkness Thy great graces, which Thou hadst begun to work inme?  Woe is me, O my Maker!  If I would make an excuse, I havenone to offer; and I only am to blame.  For if I could return toThee any portion of that love which Thou hadst begun to show untome, I would give it only unto Thee, and then everything wouldhave been safe.  But, as I have not deserved this, nor been sohappy as to have done it, let Thy mercy, O Lord, rest upon me.6. The change in the habits of my life, and in my food, provedhurtful to my health; and though my happiness was great, that wasnot enough.  The fainting-fits began to be more frequent; and myheart was so seriously affected, that every one who saw it wasalarmed; and I had also many other ailments.  And thus it was Ispent the first year, having very bad health, though I do notthink I offended God in it much.  And as my illness was soserious--I was almost insensible at all times, and frequentlywholly so--my father took great pains to find some relief; and asthe physicians who attended me had none to give, he had me takento a place which had a great reputation for the cure of otherinfirmities.  They said I should find relief there. [6]That friend of whom I have spoken as being in the house went withme. She was one of the elder nuns.  In the house where I was anun, there was no vow of enclosure. [7]7. I remained there nearly a year, for three months of itsuffering most cruel tortures--effects of the violent remedieswhich they applied.  I know not how I endured them; and indeed,though I submitted myself to them, they were, as I shallrelate, [8] more than my constitution could bear.8. I was to begin the treatment in the spring, and went thitherwhen winter commenced.  The intervening time I spent with mysister, of whom I spoke before, [9] in her house in the country,waiting for the month of April, which was drawing near, that Imight not have to go and return.  The uncle of whom I have mademention before, [10] and whose house was on our road, gave me abook called Tercer Abecedario, [11] which treats of the prayer ofrecollection.  Though in the first year I had read goodbooks--for I would read no others, because I understood now theharm they had done me--I did not know how to make my prayer, norhow to recollect myself.  I was therefore much pleased with thebook, and resolved to follow the way of prayer it described withall my might.  And as our Lord had already bestowed upon me thegift of tears, and I found pleasure in reading, I began to spenda certain time in solitude, to go frequently to confession, andmake a beginning of that way of prayer, with this book for myguide; for I had no master--I mean, no confessor--who understoodme, though I sought for such a one for twenty years afterwards:which did me much harm, in that I frequently went backwards, andmight have been even utterly lost; for, anyhow, a director wouldhave helped me to escape the risks I ran of sinning against God.9. From the very beginning, God was most gracious unto me.Though I was not so free from sin as the book required, I passedthat by; such watchfulness seemed to me almost impossible.  I wason my guard against mortal sin--and would to God I had alwaysbeen so!--but I was careless about venial sins, and that was myruin.  Yet, for all this, at the end of my stay there--I spentnearly nine months in the practice of solitude--our Lord began tocomfort me so much in this way of prayer, as in His mercy toraise me to the prayer of quiet, and now and then to that ofunion, though I understood not what either the one or the otherwas, nor the great esteem I ought to have had of them.  I believeit would have been a great blessing to me if I had understood thematter.  It is true that the prayer of union lasted but a shorttime: I know not if it continued for the space of an Ave Maria;but the fruits of it remained; and they were such that, though Iwas then not twenty years of age, I seemed to despise the worldutterly; and so I remember how sorry I was for those who followedits ways, though only in things lawful.10. I used to labour with all my might to imagine Jesus Christ,our Good and our Lord, present within me.  And this was the way Iprayed.  If I meditated on any mystery of His life, I representedit to myself as within me, though the greater part of my time Ispent in reading good books, which was all my comfort; for Godnever endowed me with the gift of making reflections with theunderstanding, or with that of using the imagination to any goodpurpose: my imagination is so sluggish, [12] that even if I wouldthink of, or picture to myself, as I used to labour to picture,our Lord's Humanity, I never could do it.11. And though men may attain more quickly to the state ofcontemplation, if they persevere, by this way of inability toexert the intellect, yet is the process more laborious andpainful; for if the will have nothing to occupy it, and if lovehave no present object to rest on, the soul is without supportand without employment--its isolation and dryness occasion greatpain, and the thoughts assail it most grievously.  Persons inthis condition must have greater purity of conscience than thosewho can make use of their understanding; for he who can use hisintellect in the way of meditation on what the world is, on whathe owes to God, on the great sufferings of God for him, his ownscanty service in return, and on the reward God reserves forthose who love Him, learns how to defend himself against his ownthoughts, and against the occasions and perils of sin.  On theother hand, he who has not that power is in greater danger, andought to occupy himself much in reading, seeing that he is not inthe slightest degree able to help himself.12. This way of proceeding is so exceedingly painful, that if themaster who teaches it insists on cutting off the succours whichreading gives, and requires the spending of much time in prayer,then, I say, it will be impossible to persevere long in it: andif he persists in his plan, health will be ruined, because it isa most painful process.  Reading is of great service towardsprocuring recollection in any one who proceeds in this way; andit is even necessary for him, however little it may be that hereads, if only as a substitute for the mental prayer which isbeyond his reach.13. Now I seem to understand that it was the good providence ofour Lord over me that found no one to teach me.  If I had, itwould have been impossible for me to persevere during theeighteen years of my trial and of those great aridities becauseof my inability to meditate.  During all this time, it was onlyafter Communion that I ever ventured to begin my prayer without abook--my soul was as much afraid to pray without one, as if ithad to fight against a host.  With a book to help me--it was likea companion, and a shield whereon to receive the blows of manythoughts--I found comfort; for it was not usual with me to be inaridity: but I always was so when I had no book; for my soul wasdisturbed, and my thoughts wandered at once.  With one, I beganto collect my thoughts, and, using it as a decoy, kept my soul inpeace, very frequently by merely opening a book--there was nonecessity for more.  Sometimes, I read but little; at othertimes, much--according as our Lord had pity on me.14. It seemed to me, in these beginnings of which I am speaking,that there could be no danger capable of withdrawing me from sogreat a blessing, if I had but books, and could have remainedalone; and I believe that, by the grace of God, it would havebeen so, if I had had a master or any one to warn me againstthose occasions of sin in the beginning, and, if I fell, to bringme quickly out of them.  If the devil had assailed me openlythen, I believe I should never have fallen into any grievous sin;but he was so subtle, and I so weak, that all my good resolutionswere of little service--though, in those days in which I servedGod, they were very profitable in enabling me, with that patiencewhich His Majesty gave me, to endure the alarming illnesses whichI had to bear.  I have often thought with wonder of the greatgoodness of God; and my soul has rejoiced in the contemplation ofHis great magnificence and mercy.  May He be blessed forever!--for I see clearly that He has not omitted to reward me,even in this life, for every one of my good desires.  My goodworks, however wretched and imperfect, have been made better andperfected by Him Who is my Lord: He has rendered themmeritorious.  As to my evil deeds and my sins, He hid them atonce.  The eyes of those who saw them, He made even blind; and Hehas blotted them out of their memory.  He gilds my faults, makesvirtue to shine forth, giving it to me Himself, and compelling meto possess it, as it were, by force.15. I must now return to that which has been enjoined me.  I say,that if I had to describe minutely how our Lord dealt with me inthe beginning, it would be necessary for me to have anotherunderstanding than that I have: so that I might be able toappreciate what I owe to Him, together with my own ingratitudeand wickedness; for I have forgotten it all.May He be blessed for ever Who has borne with me so long!  Amen.1. Antonio de Ahumada; who, according to the most probableopinion, entered the Dominican monastery of St. Thomas, Avila.It is said that he died before he was professed.

He came to the monastery forthwith, and'offered up his Isaac on Mount Carmel' (Reforma,lib. i. ch. viii. § 5).5. The Saint entered the Monastery of the Incarnation Nov. 2,1533, and made her profession Nov. 3, 1534 (Bollandists andBouix).  Ribera says she entered November 2, 1535; and thechronicler of the Order, relying on the contract by which herfather bound himself to the monastery, says that she took thehabit Nov. 2, 1536, and that Ribera had made a mistake.6. Her father took her from the monastery in the autumn of 1535,according to the Bollandists, but of 1538, according to thechronicler, who adds, that she was taken to her uncle'shouse--Pedro Sanchez de Cepeda--in Hortigosa, and then toCastellanos de la Cañada, to the house of her sister, Doña Maria,where she remained till the spring, when she went to Bezadas forher cure (Reforma, lib. i. ch. xi. § 2).7.

ISFJ	 V.Illness and Patience of the Saint.  The Story of a Priest WhomShe Rescued from a Life of Sin.1. I forgot to say how, in the year of my novitiate, I sufferedmuch uneasiness about things in themselves of no importance; butI was found fault with very often when I was blameless.  I boreit painfully and with imperfection; however, I went through itall, because of the joy I had in being a nun.  When they saw meseeking to be alone, and even weeping over my sins at times, theythought I was discontented, and said so.2. All religious observances had an attraction for me, but Icould not endure any which seemed to make me contemptible.I delighted in being thought well of by others, and was veryexact in everything I had to do.  All this I thought was avirtue, though it will not serve as any excuse for me, because Iknew what it was to procure my own satisfaction in everything,and so ignorance does not blot out the blame.  There may be someexcuse in the fact that the monastery was not founded in greatperfection.  I, wicked as I was, followed after that which I sawwas wrong, and neglected that which was good.3. There was then in the house a nun labouring under a mostgrievous and painful disorder, for there were open ulcers in herbody, caused by certain obstructions, through which her food wasrejected.  Of this sickness she soon died.  All the sisters, Isaw, were afraid of her malady.  I envied her patience very much;I prayed to God that He would give me a like patience; and then,whatever sickness it might be His pleasure to send, I do notthink I was afraid of any, for I was resolved on gaining eternalgood, and determined to gain it by any and by every means.4. I am surprised at myself, because then I had not, as Ibelieve, that love of God which I think I had after I began topray.  Then, I had only light to see that all things that passaway are to be lightly esteemed, and that the good things to begained by despising them are of great price, because they are forever.  His Majesty heard me also in this, for in less than twoyears I was so afflicted myself that the illness which I had,though of a different kind from that of the sister, was, I reallybelieve, not less painful and trying for the three years itlasted, as I shall now relate.5. When the time had come for which I was waiting in the place Ispoke of before [1]--I was in my sister's house, for the purposeof undergoing the medical treatment--they took me away with theutmost care of my comfort; that is, my father, my sister, and thenun, my friend, who had come from the monastery with me,--for herlove for me was very great.  At that moment, Satan began totrouble my soul; God, however, brought forth a great blessing outof that trouble.6. In the place to which I had gone for my cure lived a priest ofgood birth and understanding, with some learning, but not much.I went to confession to him, for I was always fond of learnedmen, although confessors indifferently learned did my soul muchharm; for I did not always find confessors whose learning was asgood as I could wish it was.  I know by experience that it isbetter, if the confessors are good men and of holy lives, thatthey should have no learning at all, than a little; for suchconfessors never trust themselves without consulting those whoare learned--nor would I trust them myself: and a really learnedconfessor never deceived me. [2]  Neither did the otherswillingly deceive me, only they knew no better; I thought theywere learned, and that I was not under any other obligation thanthat of believing them, as their instructions to me were lax, andleft me more at liberty--for if they had been strict with me, Iam so wicked, I should have sought for others. That which was avenial sin, they told me was no sin at all; of that which wasmost grievously mortal, they said it was venial. [3]7. This did me so much harm, that it is no wonder I should speakof it here as a warning to others, that they may avoid an evil sogreat; for I see clearly that in the eyes of God I was withoutexcuse, that the things I did being in themselves not good, thisshould have been enough to keep me from them.  I believe thatGod, by reason of my sins, allowed those confessors to deceivethemselves and to deceive me.  I myself deceived many others bysaying to them what had been said to me.8. I continued in this blindness, I believe, more than seventeenyears, till a most learned Dominican Father [4] undeceived me inpart, and those of the Company of Jesus made me altogether soafraid, by insisting on the erroneousness of these principles, asI shall hereafter show. [5]9. I began, then, by going to confession to that priest of whom Ispoke before. [6]  He took an extreme liking to me, because I hadthen but little to confess in comparison with what I hadafterwards; and I had never much to say since I became a nun.There was no harm in the liking he had for me, but it ceased tobe good, because it was in excess.  He clearly understood that Iwas determined on no account whatever to do anything whereby Godmight be seriously offended.  He, too, gave me a like assuranceabout himself, and accordingly our conferences were many.  But atthat time, through the knowledge and fear of God which filled mysoul, what gave me most pleasure in all my conversations withothers was to speak of God; and, as I was so young, this made himashamed; and then, out of that great goodwill he bore me, hebegan to tell me of his wretched state.  It was very sad, for hehad been nearly seven years in a most perilous condition, becauseof his affection for, and conversation with, a woman of thatplace; and yet he used to say Mass.  The matter was so public,that his honour and good name were lost, and no one ventured tospeak to him about it.  I was extremely sorry for him, because Iliked him much.  I was then so imprudent and so blind as to thinkit a virtue to be grateful and loyal to one who liked me.Cursed be that loyalty which reaches so far as to go against thelaw of God.  It is a madness common in the world, and it makes memad to see it.  We are indebted to God for all the good that mendo to us, and yet we hold it to be an act of virtue not to breaka friendship of this kind, though it lead us to go against Him.Oh, blindness of the world!  Let me, O Lord, be most ungratefulto the world; never at all unto Thee.  But I have been altogetherotherwise through my sins.10. I procured further information about the matter from membersof his household; I learned more of his ruinous state, and sawthat the poor man's fault was not so grave, because the miserablewoman had had recourse to enchantments, by giving him a littleimage made of copper, which she had begged him to wear for loveof her around his neck; and this no one had influence enough topersuade him to throw away.  As to this matter of enchantments, Ido not believe it to be altogether true; but I will relate what Isaw, by way of warning to men to be on their guard against womenwho will do things of this kind.  And let them be assured ofthis, that women--for they are more bound to purity than men--ifonce they have lost all shame before God, are in nothing whateverto be trusted; and that in exchange for the gratification oftheir will, and of that affection which the devil suggests, theywill hesitate at nothing.11. Though I have been so wicked myself, I never fell intoanything of this kind, nor did I ever attempt to do evil; nor, ifI had the power, would I have ever constrained any one to likeme, for our Lord kept me from this.  But if He had abandoned me,I should have done wrong in this, as I did in other things--forthere is nothing in me whereon anyone may rely.12. When I knew this, I began to show him greater affection: myintention was good, but the act was wrong, for I ought not to dothe least wrong for the sake of any good, how great soever it maybe.  I spoke to him most frequently of God; and this must havedone him good--though I believe that what touched him most washis great affection for me, because, to do me a pleasure, he gaveme that little image of copper, and I had it at once thrown intoa river.  When he had given it up, like a man roused from deepsleep, he began to consider all that he had done in those years;and then, amazed at himself, lamenting his ruinous state, thatwoman came to be hateful in his eyes.  Our Lady must have helpedhim greatly, for he had a very great devotion to her Conception,and used to keep the feast thereof with great solemnity.In short, he broke off all relations with that woman utterly, andwas never weary of giving God thanks for the light He had givenhim; and at the end of the year from the day I first saw him,he died.13. He had been most diligent in the service of God; and as forthat great affection he had for me, I never observed anythingwrong in it, though it might have been of greater purity.There were also occasions wherein he might have most grievouslyoffended, if he had not kept himself in the near presence of God.As I said before, [7] I would not then have done anything I knewwas a mortal sin.  And I think that observing this resolution inme helped him to have that affection for me; for I believe thatall men must have a greater affection for those women whom theysee disposed to be good; and even for the attainment of earthlyends, women must have more power over men because they are good,as I shall show hereafter.  I am convinced that the priest is inthe way of salvation.  He died most piously, and completelywithdrawn from that occasion of sin.  It seems that it was thewill of our Lord he should be saved by these means.14. I remained three months in that place, in the most grievoussufferings; for the treatment was too severe for my constitution.In two months--so strong were the medicines--my life was nearlyworn out; and the severity of the pain in the heart, [8] for thecure of which I was there was much more keen: it seemed to me,now and then, as if it had been seized by sharp teeth.  So greatwas the torment, that it was feared it might end in madness.There was a great loss of strength, for I could eat nothingwhatever, only drink.  I had a great loathing for food, and afever that never left me.  I was so reduced, for they had givenme purgatives daily for nearly a month, and so parched up, thatmy sinews began to shrink.  The pains I had were unendurable, andI was overwhelmed in a most deep sadness, so that I had no resteither night or day.15. This was the result; and thereupon my father took me back.Then the physicians visited me again.  All gave me up; they saidI was also consumptive.  This gave me little or no concern; whatdistressed me were the pains I had--for I was in pain from myhead down to my feet.  Now, nervous pains, according to thephysicians, are intolerable; and all my nerves were shrunk.Certainly, if I had not brought this upon myself by my sins, thetorture would have been unendurable.16. I was not more than three months in this cruel distress, forit seemed impossible that so many ills could be borne together.I now am astonished at myself, and the patience His Majesty gaveme--for it clearly came from Him--I look upon as a great mercy ofour Lord.  It was a great help to me to be patient, that I hadread the story of Job, in the Morals of St. Gregory (our Lordseems to have prepared me thereby); and that I had begun thepractice of prayer, so that I might bear it all, conforming mywill to the will of God.  All my conversation was with God.I had continually these words of Job in my thoughts and in mymouth: 'If we have received good things of the hand of our Lord,why should we not receive evil things?' [9]  This seemed to giveme courage.17. The feast of our Lady, in August, came round; from Apriluntil then I had been in great pain, but more especially duringthe last three months.  I made haste to go to confession, for Ihad always been very fond of frequent confession.  They thought Iwas driven by the fear of death; and so my father, in order toquiet me, would not suffer me to go.  Oh, the unreasonable loveof flesh and blood!  Though it was that of a father so Catholicand so wise--he was very much so, and this act of his could notbe the effect of any ignorance on his part--what evil it mighthave done me!18. That very night my sickness became so acute, that for aboutfour days I remained insensible.  They administered the Sacramentof the last Anointing, and every hour, or rather every moment,thought I was dying; they did nothing but repeat the Credo, as ifI could have understood anything they said.  They must haveregarded me as dead more than once, for I found afterwards dropsof wax on my eyelids.  My father, because he had not allowed meto go to confession, was grievously distressed.  Loud cries andmany prayers were made to God: blessed be He Who heard them.19. For a day-and-a-half the grave was open in my monastery,waiting for my body; [10] and the Friars of our Order, in a houseat some distance from this place, performed funeral solemnities.But it pleased our Lord I should come to myself.  I wished to goto confession at once.  I communicated with many tears; but I donot think those tears had their source in that pain and sorrowonly for having offended God, which might have sufficed for mysalvation--unless, indeed, the delusion which I laboured underwere some excuse for me, and into which I had been led by thosewho had told me that some things were not mortal sins whichafterwards I found were so certainly.20. Though my sufferings were unendurable, and my perceptionsdull, yet my confession, I believe, was complete as to allmatters wherein I understood myself to have offended God. Thisgrace, among others, did His Majesty bestow on me, that eversince my first Communion never in confession have I failed toconfess anything I thought to be a sin, though it might be only avenial sin.  But I think that undoubtedly my salvation was ingreat peril, if I had died at that time--partly because myconfessors were so unlearned, and partly because I was so verywicked.  It is certainly true that when I think of it, andconsider how our Lord seems to have raised me up from the dead, Iam so filled with wonder, that I almost tremble with fear. [11]21. And now, O my soul, it were well for thee to look that dangerin the face from which our Lord delivered thee; and if thou dostnot cease to offend Him out of love thou shouldst do so out offear.  He might have slain thee a thousand times, and in a farmore perilous state.  I believe I exaggerate nothing if I say athousand times again, though he may rebuke me who has commandedme to restrain myself in recounting my sins; and they are glossedover enough. I pray him, for the love of God, not to suppress oneof my faults, because herein shines forth the magnificence ofGod, as well as His long-suffering towards souls.  May He beblessed for evermore, and destroy me utterly, rather than let mecease to love Him any more!1. Ch. iv. § 6.

Some of the nuns of the Incarnation were in the house, sentthither from the monastery; and, but for the father's disbeliefin her death, would have taken her home for burial (Ribera,lib. i. ch. iv.).11. Ribera, lib. i. ch. iv., says he heard Fra Bañes, in asermon, say that the Saint told him she had, during these fourdays, seen hell in a vision.  And the chronicler says that thoughthere was bodily illness, yet it was a trance of the soul at thesame time (vol. i. lib. i. ch. xii. § 3).
ISFJ	 VI.The Great Debt She Owed to Our Lord for His Mercy to Her.She Takes St. Joseph for Her Patron.1. After those four days, during which I was insensible, so greatwas my distress, that our Lord alone knoweth the intolerablesufferings I endured.  My tongue was bitten to pieces; there wasa choking in my throat because I had taken nothing, and becauseof my weakness, so that I could not swallow even a drop of water;all my bones seemed to be out of joint, and the disorder of myhead was extreme.  I was bent together like a coil of ropes--forto this was I brought by the torture of those days--unable tomove either arm, or foot, or hand, or head, any more than if Ihad been dead, unless others moved me; I could move, however, Ithink, one finger of my right hand.  Then, as to touching me,that was impossible, for I was so bruised that I could not endureit.  They used to move me in a sheet, one holding one end, andanother the other.  This lasted till Palm Sunday. [1]2. The only comfort I had was this--if no one came near me, mypains frequently ceased; and then, because I had a little rest, Iconsidered myself well, for I was afraid my patience would fail:and thus I was exceedingly happy when I saw myself free fromthose pains which were so sharp and constant, though in the coldfits of an intermittent fever, which were most violent, they werestill unendurable.  My dislike of food was very great.3. I was now so anxious to return to my monastery, that I hadmyself conveyed thither in the state I was in.  There theyreceived alive one whom they had waited for as dead; but her bodywas worse than dead: the sight of it could only give pain.  It isimpossible to describe my extreme weakness, for I was nothing butbones.  I remained in this state, as I have already said, [2]more than eight months; and was paralytic, though getting better,for about three years.  I praised God when I began to crawl on myhands and knees.  I bore all this with great resignation, and, ifI except the beginning of my illness, with great joy; for allthis was as nothing in comparison with the pains and tortures Ihad to bear at first.  I was resigned to the will of God, even ifHe left me in this state for ever.  My anxiety about the recoveryof my health seemed to be grounded on my desire to pray insolitude, as I had been taught; for there were no means of doingso in the infirmary.  I went to confession most frequently, spokemuch about God, and in such a way as to edify everyone; and theyall marvelled at the patience which our Lord gave me--for if ithad not come from the hand of His Majesty, it seemed impossibleto endure so great an affliction with so great a joy.4. It was a great thing for me to have had the grace of prayerwhich God had wrought in me; it made me understand what it is tolove Him.  In a little while, I saw these virtues renewed withinme; still they were not strong, for they were not sufficient tosustain me in justice.  I never spoke ill in the slightest degreewhatever of any one, and my ordinary practice was to avoid alldetraction; for I used to keep most carefully in mind that Iought not to assent to, nor say of another, anything I should notlike to have said of myself.  I was extremely careful to keepthis resolution on all occasions though not so perfectly, uponsome great occasions that presented themselves, as not to breakit sometimes.  But my ordinary practice was this: and thus thosewho were about me, and those with whom I conversed, became soconvinced that it was right, that they adopted it as a habit.It came to be understood that where I was, absent persons weresafe; so they were also with my friends and kindred, and withthose whom I instructed.  Still, for all this, I have a strictaccount to give unto God for the bad example I gave in otherrespects. May it please His Majesty to forgive me, for I havebeen the cause of much evil; though not with intentions asperverse as were the acts that followed.5. The longing for solitude remained, and I loved to discourseand speak of God; for if I found any one with whom I could do so,it was a greater joy and satisfaction to me than all therefinements--or rather to speak more correctly, the realrudeness--of the world's conversation.  I communicated andconfessed more frequently still, and desired to do so; I wasextremely fond of reading good books; I was most deeply penitentfor having offended God; and I remember that very often I did notdare to pray, because I was afraid of that most bitter anguishwhich I felt for having offended God, dreading it as a greatchastisement.  This grew upon me afterwards to so great a degree,that I know of no torment wherewith to compare it; and yet it wasneither more nor less because of any fear I had at any time, forit came upon me only when I remembered the consolations of ourLord which He gave me in prayer, the great debt I owed Him, theevil return I made: I could not bear it.  I was also extremelyangry with myself on account of the many tears I shed for myfaults, when I saw how little I improved, seeing that neither mygood resolutions, nor the pains I took, were sufficient to keepme from falling whenever I had the opportunity.  I looked on mytears as a delusion; and my faults, therefore, I regarded as themore grievous, because I saw the great goodness of our Lord to mein the shedding of those tears, and together with them suchdeep compunction.6. I took care to go to confession as soon as I could; and, as Ithink, did all that was possible on my part to return to a stateof grace.  But the whole evil lay in my not thoroughly avoidingthe occasions of sin, and in my confessors, who helped me solittle.  If they had told me that I was travelling on a dangerousroad, and that I was bound to abstain from those conversations, Ibelieve, without any doubt, that the matter would have beenremedied, because I could not bear to remain even for one day inmortal sin, if I knew it.7. All these tokens of the fear of God came to me through prayer;and the greatest of them was this, that fear was swallowed up oflove--for I never thought of chastisement.  All the time I was soill, my strict watch over my conscience reached to all that ismortal sin.8. O my God! I wished for health, that I might serve Thee better;that was the cause of all my ruin.  For when I saw how helpless Iwas through paralysis, being still so young, and how thephysicians of this world had dealt with me, I determined to askthose of heaven to heal me--for I wished, nevertheless, to bewell, though I bore my illness with great joy.  Sometimes, too, Iused to think that if I recovered my health, and yet were lostfor ever, I was better as I was.  But, for all that, I thought Imight serve God much better if I were well.  This is ourdelusion; we do not resign ourselves absolutely to thedisposition of our Lord, Who knows best what is for our good.9. I began by having Masses and prayers said for myintention--prayers that were highly sanctioned; for I never likedthose other devotions which some people, especially women, makeuse of with a ceremoniousness to me intolerable, but which movethem to be devout.  I have been given to understand since thatthey were unseemly and superstitious; and I took for my patronand lord the glorious St. Joseph, and recommended myselfearnestly to him.  I saw clearly that both out of this my presenttrouble, and out of others of greater importance, relating to myhonour and the loss of my soul, this my father and lord deliveredme, and rendered me greater services than I knew how to ask for.I cannot call to mind that I have ever asked him at any time foranything which he has not granted; and I am filled with amazementwhen I consider the great favours which God hath given me throughthis blessed Saint; the dangers from which he hath delivered me,both of body and of soul.  To other Saints, our Lord seems tohave given grace to succour men in some special necessity; but tothis glorious Saint, I know by experience, to help us in all: andour Lord would have us understand that as He was Himself subjectto him upon earth--for St. Joseph having the title of father, andbeing His guardian, could command Him--so now in heaven Heperforms all his petitions.  I have asked others to recommendthemselves to St. Joseph, and they too know this by experience;and there are many who are now of late devout to him, [3] havinghad experience of this truth.10. I used to keep his feast with all the solemnity I could, butwith more vanity than spirituality, seeking rather too muchsplendour and effect, and yet with good intentions.  I had thisevil in me, that if our Lord gave me grace to do any good, thatgood became full of imperfections and of many faults; but as fordoing wrong, the indulgence of curiosity and vanity, I was veryskilful and active therein.  Our Lord forgive me!11. Would that I could persuade all men to be devout to thisglorious Saint; for I know by long experience what blessings hecan obtain for us from God.  I have never known any one who wasreally devout to him, and who honoured him by particularservices, who did not visibly grow more and more in virtue; forhe helps in a special way those souls who commend themselves tohim.  It is now some years since I have always on his feast askedhim for something, and I always have it.  If the petition be inany way amiss, he directs it aright for my greater good.12. If I were a person who had authority to write, it would be apleasure to me to be diffusive in speaking most minutely of thegraces which this glorious Saint has obtained for me and forothers.  But that I may not go beyond the commandment that islaid upon me, I must in many things be more brief than I couldwish, and more diffusive than is necessary in others; for, inshort, I am a person who, in all that is good, has but littlediscretion.  But I ask, for the love of God, that he who does notbelieve me will make the trial for himself--when he will see byexperience the great good that results from commending oneself tothis glorious patriarch, and being devout to him.  Those who givethemselves to prayer should in a special manner have always adevotion to St. Joseph; for I know not how any man can think ofthe Queen of the angels, during the time that she suffered somuch with the Infant Jesus, without giving thanks to St. Josephfor the services he rendered them then.  He who cannot find anyone to teach him how to pray, let him take this glorious Saintfor his master, and he will not wander out of the way.13. May it please our Lord that I have not done amiss inventuring to speak about St. Joseph; for, though I publiclyprofess my devotion to him, I have always failed in my service tohim and imitation of him.  He was like himself when he made meable to rise and walk, no longer a paralytic; and I, too, am likemyself when I make so bad a use of this grace.14. Who could have said that I was so soon to fall, after suchgreat consolations from God--after His Majesty had implantedvirtues in me which of themselves made me serve Him--after I hadbeen, as it were, dead, and in such extreme peril of eternaldamnation--after He had raised me up, soul and body, so that allwho saw me marvelled to see me alive?  What can it mean, O myLord?  The life we live is so full of danger!  While I am writingthis--and it seems to me, too, by Thy grace and mercy--I may saywith St. Paul, though not so truly as he did: 'It is not I wholive now, but Thou, my Creator, livest in me.' [4]  For someyears past, so it seems to me, Thou hast held me by the hand; andI see in myself desires and resolutions--in some measure testedby experience, in many ways, during that time--never to doanything, however slight it may be, contrary to Thy will, thoughI must have frequently offended Thy Divine Majesty without beingaware of it; and I also think that nothing can be proposed to methat I should not with great resolution undertake for Thy love.In some things Thou hast Thyself helped me to succeed therein.I love neither the world, nor the things of the world; nor do Ibelieve that anything that does not come from Thee can give mepleasure; everything else seems to me a heavy cross.15. Still, I may easily deceive myself, and it may be that I amnot what I say I am; but Thou knowest, O my Lord, that, to thebest of my knowledge, I lie not.  I am afraid, and with goodreason, lest Thou shouldst abandon me; for I know now how far mystrength and little virtue can reach, if Thou be not ever at handto supply them, and to help me never to forsake Thee.  May HisMajesty grant that I be not forsaken of Thee even now, when I amthinking all this of myself!16. I know not how we can wish to live, seeing that everything isso uncertain.  Once, O Lord, I thought it impossible to forsakeThee so utterly; and now that I have forsaken Thee so often, Icannot help being afraid; for when Thou didst withdraw but alittle from me, I fell down to the ground at once.  Blessed forever be Thou!  Though I have forsaken Thee, Thou hast notforsaken me so utterly but that Thou hast come again and raisedme up, giving me Thy hand always.  Very often, O Lord, I wouldnot take it: very often I would not listen when Thou wert callingme again, as I am going to show.1. March 25, 1537.2. Ch. v. § 17.  The Saint left her monastery in 1535; and in thespring of 1536 went from her sister's house to Bezadas; and inJuly of that year was brought back to her father's house inAvila, wherein she remained till Palm Sunday, 1537, when shereturned to the Monastery of the Incarnation.  She had beenseized with paralysis there, and laboured under it nearly threeyears, from 1536 to 1539, when she was miraculously healedthrough the intercession of St. Joseph (Bolland, n. 100, 101).The dates of the Chronicler are different from these.3. Of the devotion to St. Joseph, F. Faber (The BlessedSacrament, bk. ii. p. 199, 3rd ed.) says that it took its rise inthe West, in a confraternity in Avignon.  'Then it spread overthe church. Gerson was raised up to be its doctor and theologian,and St. Teresa to be its Saint, and St. Francis of Sales to beits popular teacher and missionary.

ISFJ	 VII.Lukewarmness.  The Loss of Grace.  Inconvenience of Laxity inReligious Houses.1. So, then, going on from pastime to pastime, from vanity tovanity, from one occasion of sin to another, I began to exposemyself exceedingly to the very greatest dangers: my soul was sodistracted by many vanities, that I was ashamed to draw near untoGod in an act of such special friendship as that of prayer. [1]As my sins multiplied, I began to lose the pleasure and comfort Ihad in virtuous things: and that loss contributed to theabandonment of prayer.  I see now most clearly, O my Lord, thatthis comfort departed from me because I had departed from Thee.2. It was the most fearful delusion into which Satan could plungeme--to give up prayer under the pretence of humility.  I began tobe afraid of giving myself to prayer, because I saw myself solost.  I thought it would be better for me, seeing that in mywickedness I was one of the most wicked, to live like themultitude--to say the prayers which I was bound to say, and thatvocally: not to practise mental prayer nor commune with God somuch; for I deserved to be with the devils, and was deceivingthose who were about me, because I made an outward show ofgoodness; and therefore the community in which I dwelt is not tobe blamed; for with my cunning I so managed matters, that all hada good opinion of me; and yet I did not seek this deliberately bysimulating devotion; for in all that relates to hypocrisy andostentation--glory be to God!--I do not remember that I everoffended Him, [2] so far as I know.  The very first movementsherein gave me such pain, that the devil would depart from mewith loss, and the gain remained with me; and thus, accordingly,he never tempted me much in this way.  Perhaps, however, if Godhad permitted Satan to tempt me as sharply herein as he temptedme in other things, I should have fallen also into this; but HisMajesty has preserved me until now.  May He be blessed forevermore!  It was rather a heavy affliction to me that I shouldbe thought so well of; for I knew my own secret.3. The reason why they thought I was not so wicked was this: theysaw that I, who was so young, and exposed to so many occasions ofsin, withdrew myself so often into solitude for prayer, readmuch, spoke of God, that I liked to have His image painted inmany places, to have an oratory of my own, and furnish it withobjects of devotion, that I spoke ill of no one, and other thingsof the same kind in me which have the appearance of virtue.  Yetall the while--I was so vain--I knew how to procure respect formyself by doing those things which in the world are usuallyregarded with respect.4. In consequence of this, they gave me as much liberty as theydid to the oldest nuns, and even more, and had great confidencein me; for as to taking any liberty for myself, or doing anythingwithout leave--such as conversing through the door, or in secret,or by night--I do not think I could have brought myself to speakwith anybody in the monastery in that way, and I never did it;for our Lord held me back.  It seemed to me--for I consideredmany things carefully and of set purpose--that it would be a veryevil deed on my part, wicked as I was, to risk the credit of somany nuns, who were all good--as if everything else I did waswell done!  In truth, the evil I did was not the result ofdeliberation, as this would have been, if I had done it, althoughit was too much so.5. Therefore, I think that it did me much harm to be in amonastery not enclosed.  The liberty which those who were goodmight have with advantage--they not being obliged to do more thanthey do, because they had not bound themselves toenclosure--would certainly have led me, who am wicked, straightto hell, if our Lord, by so many remedies and means of His mostsingular mercy, had not delivered me out of that danger--and itis, I believe, the very greatest danger--namely, a monastery ofwomen unenclosed--yea, more, I think it is, for those who will bewicked, a road to hell, rather than a help to their weakness.This is not to be understood of my monastery; for there are somany there who in the utmost sincerity, and in great perfection,serve our Lord, so that His Majesty, according to His goodness,cannot but be gracious unto them; neither is it one of thosewhich are most open for all religious observances are kept in it;and I am speaking only of others which I have seen and known.6. I am exceedingly sorry for these houses, because our Lord mustof necessity send His special inspirations not merely once, butmany times, if the nuns therein are to be saved, seeing that thehonours and amusements of the world are allowed among them, andthe obligations of their state are so ill-understood.  God grantthey may not count that to be virtue which is sin, as I did sooften!  It is very difficult to make people understand this; itis necessary our Lord Himself should take the matter seriouslyinto His own hands.7. If parents would take my advice, now that they are at no painsto place their daughters where they may walk in the way ofsalvation without incurring a greater risk than they would do ifthey were left in the world, let them look at least at that whichconcerns their good name.  Let them marry them to persons of amuch lower degree, rather than place them in monasteries of thiskind, unless they be of extremely good inclinations, and Godgrant that these inclinations may come to good! or let them keepthem at home.  If they will be wicked at home, their evil lifecan be hidden only for a short time; but in monasteries it can behidden long, and, in the end, it is our Lord that discovers it.They injure not only themselves, but all the nuns also.  And allthe while the poor things are not in fault; for they walk in theway that is shown them.  Many of them are to be pitied; for theywished to withdraw from the world, and, thinking to escape fromthe dangers of it, and that they were going to serve our Lord,have found themselves in ten worlds at once, without knowing whatto do, or how to help themselves.  Youth and sensuality and thedevil invite them and incline them to follow certain ways whichare of the essence of worldliness.  They see these ways, so tospeak, considered as safe there.8. Now, these seem to me to be in some degree like those wretchedheretics who will make themselves blind, and who will considerthat which they do to be good, and so believe, but without reallybelieving; for they have within themselves something that tellsthem it is wrong.9. Oh, what utter ruin! utter ruin of religious persons--I am notspeaking now more of women than of men--where the rules of theOrder are not kept; where the same monastery offers two roads:one of virtue and observance, the other of inobservance, and bothequally frequented!  I have spoken incorrectly: they are notequally frequented; for, on account of our sins, the way of thegreatest imperfection is the most frequented; and because it isthe broadest, it is also the most in favour.  The way ofreligious observance is so little used, that the friar and thenun who would really begin to follow their vocation thoroughlyhave reason to fear the members of their communities more thanall the devils together.  They must be more cautious, anddissemble more, when they would speak of that friendship with Godwhich they desire to have, than when they would speak of thosefriendships and affections which the devil arranges inmonasteries.  I know not why we are astonished that the Church isin so much trouble, when we see those, who ought to be an exampleof every virtue to others, so disfigure the work which the spiritof the Saints departed wrought in their Orders.  May it pleaseHis Divine Majesty to apply a remedy to this, as He sees it to beneedful!  Amen.10. So, then, when I began to indulge in these conversations, Idid not think, seeing they were customary, that my soul must beinjured and dissipated, as I afterwards found it must be, by suchconversations.  I thought that, as receiving visits was so commonin many monasteries, no more harm would befall me thereby thanbefell others, whom I knew to be good.  I did not observe thatthey were much better than I was, and that an act which wasperilous for me was not so perilous for them; and yet I have nodoubt there was some danger in it, were it nothing else but awaste of time.11. I was once with a person--it was at the very beginning of myacquaintance with her when our Lord was pleased to show me thatthese friendships were not good for me: to warn me also, and inmy blindness, which was so great, to give me light.  Christ stoodbefore me, stern and grave, giving me to understand what in myconduct was offensive to Him.  I saw Him with the eyes of thesoul more distinctly than I could have seen Him with the eyes ofthe body.  The vision made so deep an impression upon me, that,though it is more than twenty-six years ago, [3] I seem to seeHim present even now.  I was greatly astonished and disturbed,and I resolved not to see that person again.12. It did me much harm that I did not then know it was possibleto see anything otherwise than with the eyes of the body; [4] sodid Satan too, in that he helped me to think so: he made meunderstand it to be impossible, and suggested that I had imaginedthe vision--that it might be Satan himself--and othersuppositions of that kind.  For all this, the impression remainedwith me that the vision was from God, and not an imagination;but, as it was not to my liking, I forced myself to lie tomyself; and as I did not dare to discuss the matter with any one,and as great importunity was used, I went back to my formerconversation with the same person, and with others also, atdifferent times; for I was assured that there was no harm inseeing such a person, and that I gained, instead of losing,reputation by doing so.  I spent many years in this pestilentamusement; for it never appeared to me, when I was engaged in it,to be so bad as it really was, though at times I saw clearly itwas not good.  But no one caused me the same distraction whichthat person did of whom I am speaking; and that was because I hada great affection for her.13. At another time, when I was with that person, we saw, both ofus, and others who were present also saw, something like a greattoad crawling towards us, more rapidly than such a creature is inthe habit of crawling.  I cannot understand how a reptile of thatkind could, in the middle of the day, have come forth from thatplace; it never had done so before, [5] but the impression itmade on me was such, that I think it must have had a meaning;neither have I ever forgotten it.  Oh, the greatness of God! withwhat care and tenderness didst Thou warn me in every way! and howlittle I profited by those warnings!14. There was in that house a nun, who was related to me, nowgrown old, a great servant of God, and a strict observer of therule.  She too warned me from time to time; but I not only didnot listen to her, but was even offended, thinking she wasscandalized without cause.  I have mentioned this in order thatmy wickedness and the great goodness of God might be understood,and to show how much I deserved hell for ingratitude so great,and, moreover, if it should be our Lord's will and pleasure thatany nun at any time should read this, that she might take warningby me.  I beseech them all, for the love of our Lord, to fleefrom such recreations as these.15. May His Majesty grant I may undeceive some one of the many Iled astray when I told them there was no harm in these things,and assured them there was no such great danger therein. I did sobecause I was blind myself; for I would not deliberately leadthem astray.  By the bad example I set before them--I spoke ofthis before [6]--I was the occasion of much evil, not thinking Iwas doing so much harm.16. In those early days, when I was ill, and before I knew how tobe of use to myself, I had a very strong desire to further theprogress of others: [7] a most common temptation of beginners.With me, however, it had good results.  Loving my father so much,I longed to see him in the possession of that good which I seemedto derive myself from prayer.  I thought that in this life therecould not be a greater good than prayer; and by roundabout ways,as well as I could, I contrived make him enter upon it; I gavehim books for that end.  As he was so good--I said sobefore [8]--this exercise took such a hold upon him, that in fiveor six years, I think it was, he made so great a progress that Iused to praise our Lord for it.  It was a very great consolationto me. He had most grievous trials of diverse kinds; and he borethem all with the greatest resignation.  He came often to see me;for it was a comfort to him to speak of the things of God.17. And now that I had become so dissipated, and had ceased topray, and yet saw that he still thought I was what I used to be,I could not endure it, and so undeceived him.  I had been a yearand more without praying, thinking it an act of greater humilityto abstain.  This--I shall speak of it again [9]--was thegreatest temptation I ever had, because it very nearly wrought myutter ruin; [10] for, when I used to pray, if I offended God oneday, on the following days I would recollect myself, and withdrawfarther from the occasions of sin.18. When that blessed man, having that good opinion of me, cameto visit me, it pained me to see him so deceived as to think thatI used to pray to God as before.  So I told him that I did notpray; but I did not tell him why.  I put my infirmities forwardas an excuse; for though I had recovered from that which was sotroublesome, I have always been weak, even very much so; andthough my infirmities are somewhat less troublesome now than theywere, they still afflict me in many ways; specially, I have beensuffering for twenty years from sickness every morning, [11] sothat I could not take any food till past mid-day, and evenoccasionally not till later; and now, since my Communions havebecome more frequent, it is at night, before I lie down to rest,that the sickness occurs, and with greater pain; for I have tobring it on with a feather, or other means.  If I do not bring iton, I suffer more; and thus I am never, I believe, free fromgreat pain, which is sometimes very acute, especially about theheart; though the fainting-fits are now but of rare occurrence.I am also, these eight years past, free from the paralysis, andfrom other infirmities of fever, which I had so often.  Theseafflictions I now regard so lightly, that I am even glad of them,believing that our Lord in some degree takes His pleasurein them.19. My father believed me when I gave him that for a reason, ashe never told a lie himself; neither should I have done so,considering the relation we were in.  I told him, in order to bethe more easily believed, that it was much for me to be able toattend in choir, though I saw clearly that this was no excusewhatever; neither, however, was it a sufficient reason for givingup a practice which does not require, of necessity, bodilystrength, but only love and a habit thereof; yet our Lord alwaysfurnishes an opportunity for it, if we but seek it.  I sayalways; for though there may be times, as in illness, and fromother causes, when we cannot be much alone, yet it never can bebut there must be opportunities when our strength is sufficientfor the purpose; and in sickness itself, and amidst otherhindrances, true prayer consists, when the soul loves, inoffering up its burden, and in thinking of Him for Whom itsuffers, and in the resignation of the will, and in a thousandways which then present themselves.  It is under thesecircumstances that love exerts itself for it is not necessarilyprayer when we are alone; and neither is it not prayer when weare not.20. With a little care, we may find great blessings on thoseoccasions when our Lord, by means of afflictions, deprives us oftime for prayer; and so I found it when I had a good conscience.But my father, having that opinion of me which he had, andbecause of the love he bore me, believed all I told him;moreover, he was sorry for me; and as he had now risen to greatheights of prayer himself, he never remained with me long; forwhen he had seen me, he went his way, saying that he was wastinghis time.  As I was wasting it in other vanities, I cared littleabout this.21. My father was not the only person whom I prevailed upon topractise prayer, though I was walking in vanity myself.  When Isaw persons fond of reciting their prayers, I showed them how tomake a meditation, and helped them and gave them books; for fromthe time I began myself to pray, as I said before, [12] I alwayshad a desire that others should serve God.  I thought, now that Idid not myself serve our Lord according to the light I had, thatthe knowledge His Majesty had given me ought not to be lost, andthat others should serve Him for me. [13]  I say this in order toexplain the great blindness I was in: going to ruin myself, andlabouring to save others.22. At this time, that illness befell my father of which hedied; [14] it lasted some days.  I went to nurse him, being moresick in spirit than he was in body, owing to my manyvanities--though not, so far as I know, to the extent of being inmortal sin--through the whole of that wretched time of which I amspeaking; for, if I knew myself to be in mortal sin, I would nothave continued in it on any account.  I suffered much myselfduring his illness.  I believe I rendered him some service inreturn for what he had suffered in mine.  Though I was very ill,I did violence to myself; and though in losing him I was to loseall the comfort and good of my life--he was all this to me--I wasso courageous, that I never betrayed my sorrows, concealing themtill he was dead, as if I felt none at all.  It seemed as if myvery soul were wrenched when I saw him at the point of death--mylove for him was so deep.23. It was a matter for which we ought to praise our Lord--thedeath that he died, and the desire he had to die; so also was theadvice he gave us after the last anointing, how he charged us torecommend him to God, and to pray for mercy for him, how he badeus serve God always, and consider how all things come to an end.He told us with tears how sorry he was that he had not served Himhimself; for he wished he was a friar--I mean, that he had beenone in the Strictest Order that is.  I have a most assuredconviction that our Lord, some fifteen days before, had revealedto him he was not to live; for up to that time, though very ill,he did not think so; but now, though he was somewhat better, andthe physicians said so, he gave no heed to them, but employedhimself in the ordering of his soul.24. His chief suffering consisted in a most acute pain of theshoulders, which never left him: it was so sharp at times, thatit put him into great torture.  I said to him, that as he had sogreat a devotion to our Lord carrying His cross on His shoulders,he should now think that His Majesty wished him to feel somewhatof that pain which He then suffered Himself. This so comfortedhim, that I do not think I heard him complain afterwards.25. He remained three days without consciousness; but on the dayhe died, our Lord restored him so completely, that we wereastonished: he preserved his understanding to the last; for inthe middle of the creed, which he repeated himself, he died.He lay there like an angel--such he seemed to me, if I may sayso, both in soul and disposition: he was very good.26. I know not why I have said this, unless it be for the purposeof showing how much the more I am to be blamed for my wickedness;for after seeing such a death, and knowing what his life hadbeen, I, in order to be in any wise like unto such a father,ought to have grown better.  His confessor, a most learnedDominican, [15] used to say that he had no doubt he went straightto heaven. [16]  He had heard his confession for some years, andspoke with praise of the purity of his conscience.27. This Dominican father, who was a very good man, fearing God,did me a very great service; for I confessed to him.  He tookupon himself the task of helping my soul in earnest, and ofmaking me see the perilous state I was in. [17]  He sent me toCommunion once a fortnight; [18] and I, by degrees beginning tospeak to him, told him about my prayer.  He charged me never toomit it: that, anyhow, it could not do me anything but good.I began to return to it--though I did not cut off the occasionsof sin--and never afterwards gave it up.  My life became mostwretched, because I learned in prayer more and more of my faults.On one side, God was calling me; on the other, I was followingthe world.  All the things of God gave me great pleasure; and Iwas a prisoner to the things of the world.  It seemed as if Iwished to reconcile two contradictions, so much at variance onewith another as are the life of the spirit and the joys andpleasures and amusements of sense. [19]28. I suffered much in prayer; for the spirit was slave, and notmaster; and so I was not able to shut myself up withinmyself--that was my whole method of prayer--without shutting upwith me a thousand vanities at the same time.  I spent many yearsin this way; and I am now astonished that any one could haveborne it without abandoning either the one or the other.  I knowwell that it was not in my power then to give up prayer, becauseHe held me in His hand Who sought me that He might show megreater mercies.29. O my God! if I might, I would speak of the occasions fromwhich God delivered me, and how I threw myself into them again;and of the risks I ran of losing utterly my good name, from whichHe delivered me.  I did things to show what I was; and our Lordhid the evil, and revealed some little virtue--if so be I hadany--and made it great in the eyes of all, so that they alwaysheld me in much honour.  For although my follies cameoccasionally into light, people would not believe it when theysaw other things, which they thought good.  The reason is, thatHe Who knoweth all things saw it was necessary it should be so,in order that I might have some credit given me by those to whomin after years I was to speak of His service.  His suprememunificence regarded not my great sins, but rather the desires Ifrequently had to please Him, and the pain I felt because I hadnot the strength to bring those desires to good effect.30. O Lord of my soul! how shall I be able to magnify the graceswhich Thou, in those years, didst bestow upon me?  Oh, how, atthe very time that I offended Thee most, Thou didst prepare me ina moment, by a most profound compunction, to taste of thesweetness of Thy consolations and mercies!  In truth, O my King,Thou didst administer to me the most delicate and painfulchastisement it was possible for me to bear; for Thou knewestwell what would have given me the most pain.  Thou didst chastisemy sins with great consolations.  I do not believe I am sayingfoolish things, though it may well be that I am beside myselfwhenever I call to mind my ingratitude and my wickedness.31. It was more painful for me, in the state I was in, to receivegraces, when I had fallen into grievous faults, than it wouldhave been to receive chastisement; for one of those faults, I amsure, used to bring me low, shame and distress me, more than manydiseases, together with many heavy trials, could have done.For, as to the latter, I saw that I deserved them; and it seemedto me that by them I was making some reparation for my sins,though it was but slight, for my sins are so many.  But when Isee myself receive graces anew, after being so ungrateful forthose already received, that is to me--and, I believe, to all whohave any knowledge or love of God--a fearful kind of torment.  Wemay see how true this is by considering what a virtuous mind mustbe. Hence my tears and vexation when I reflected on what I felt,seeing myself in a condition to fall at every moment, though myresolutions and desires then--I am speaking of thattime--were strong.32. It is a great evil for a soul to be alone in the midst ofsuch great dangers; it seems to me that if I had had any one withwhom I could have spoken of all this, it might have helped me notto fall.  I might, at least, have been ashamed before him--andyet I was not ashamed before God.33. For this reason, I would advise those who give themselves toprayer, particularly at first, to form friendships; and conversefamiliarly, with others who are doing the same thing.  It is amatter of the last importance, even if it lead only to helpingone another by prayer: how much more, seeing that it has led tomuch greater gain!  Now, if in their intercourse one withanother, and in the indulgence of human affections even not ofthe best kind, men seek friends with whom they may refreshthemselves, and for the purpose of having greater satisfaction inspeaking of their empty joys, I know no reason why it should notbe lawful for him who is beginning to love and serve God inearnest to confide to another his joys and sorrows; for they whoare given to prayer are thoroughly accustomed to both.34. For if that friendship with God which he desires be real, lethim not be afraid of vain-glory; and if the first movementsthereof assail him, he will escape from it with merit; and Ibelieve that he who will discuss the matter with this intentionwill profit both himself and those who hear him, and thus willderive more light for his own understanding, as well as for theinstruction of his friends.  He who in discussing his method ofprayer falls into vain-glory will do so also when he hears Massdevoutly, if he is seen of men, and in doing other good works,which must be done under pain of being no Christian; and yetthese things must not be omitted through fear of vain-glory.35. Moreover, it is a most important matter for those souls whoare not strong in virtue; for they have so many people, enemiesas well as friends, to urge them the wrong way, that I do not seehow this point is capable of exaggeration.  It seems to me thatSatan has employed this artifice--and it is of the greatestservice to him--namely, that men who really wish to love andplease God should hide the fact, while others, at his suggestion,make open show of their malicious dispositions; and this is socommon, that it seems a matter of boasting now, and the offencescommitted against God are thus published abroad.36. I do not know whether the things I am saying are foolish ornot.  If they be so, your reverence will strike them out.I entreat you to help my simplicity by adding a good deal tothis, because the things that relate to the service of God are sofeebly managed, that it is necessary for those who would serveHim to join shoulder to shoulder, if they are to advance at all;for it is considered safe to live amidst the vanities andpleasures of the world, and few there be who regard them withunfavourable eyes.  But if any one begins to give himself up tothe service of God, there are so many to find fault with him,that it becomes necessary for him to seek companions, in orderthat he may find protection among them till he grows strongenough not to feel what he may be made to suffer.  If he doesnot, he will find himself in great straits.37. This, I believe, must have been the reason why some of theSaints withdrew into the desert.  And it is a kind of humility inman not to trust to himself, but to believe that God will helphim in his relations with those with whom he converses; andcharity grows by being diffused; and there are a thousandblessings herein which I would not dare to speak of, if I had notknown by experience the great importance of it.  It is very truethat I am the most wicked and the basest of all who are born ofwomen; but I believe that he who, humbling himself, thoughstrong, yet trusteth not in himself, and believeth another who inthis matter has had experience, will lose nothing.  Of myself Imay say that, if our Lord had not revealed to me this truth, andgiven me the opportunity of speaking very frequently to personsgiven to prayer, I should have gone on falling and rising till Itumbled into hell.  I had many friends to help me to fall; but asto rising again, I was so much left to myself, that I wonder nowI was not always on the ground.  I praise God for His mercy; forit was He only Who stretched out His hand to me.  May He beblessed for ever!  Amen.1. See Way of Perfection, ch. xl.; but ch. xxvii. of theformer editions.2.

ISFJ	 VIII.The Saint Ceases Not to Pray.  Prayer the Way to Recover WhatIs Lost.  All Exhorted to Pray.  The Great Advantage of Prayer,Even to Those Who May Have Ceased from It.1. It is not without reason that I have dwelt so long on thisportion of my life.  I see clearly that it will give no onepleasure to see anything so base; and certainly I wish those whomay read this to have me in abhorrence, as a soul so obstinateand so ungrateful to Him Who did so much for me.  I could wish,too, I had permission to say how often at this time I failed inmy duty to God, because I was not leaning on the strong pillar ofprayer.  I passed nearly twenty years on this stormy sea, fallingand rising, but rising to no good purpose, seeing that I went andfell again.  My life was one of perfection; but it was so mean,that I scarcely made any account whatever of venial sins; andthough of mortal sins I was afraid, I was not so afraid of themas I ought to have been, because I did not avoid the perilousoccasions of them.  I may say that it was the most painful lifethat can be imagined, because I had no sweetness in God, and nopleasure in the world.2. When I was in the midst of the pleasures of the world, theremembrance of what I owed to God made me sad; and when I waspraying to God, my worldly affections disturbed me.  This is sopainful a struggle, that I know not how I could have borne it fora month, let alone for so many years.  Nevertheless, I can tracedistinctly the great mercy of our Lord to me, while thus immersedin the world, in that I had still the courage to pray.  I saycourage, because I know of nothing in the whole world whichrequires greater courage than plotting treason against the King,knowing that He knows it, and yet never withdrawing from Hispresence; for, granting that we are always in the presence ofGod, yet it seems to me that those who pray arc in His presencein a very different sense; for they, as it were, see that He islooking upon them; while others may be for days together withouteven once recollecting that God sees them.3. It is true, indeed, that during these years there were manymonths, and, I believe, occasionally a whole year, in which I sokept guard over myself that I did not offend our Lord, gavemyself much to prayer, and took some pains, and thatsuccessfully, not to offend Him.  I speak of this now, becauseall I am saying is strictly true; but I remember very little ofthose good days, and so they must have been few, while my evildays were many.  Still, the days that passed over without myspending a great part of them in prayer were few, unless I wasvery ill, or very much occupied.4. When I was ill, I was well with God.  I contrived that thoseabout me should be so, too, and I made supplications to our Lordfor this grace, and spoke frequently of Him.  Thus, with theexception of that year of which I have been speaking, duringeight-and-twenty years of prayer, I spent more than eighteen inthat strife and contention which arose out of my attempts toreconcile God and the world.  As to the other years, of which Ihave now to speak, in them the grounds of the warfare, though itwas not slight, were changed; but inasmuch as I was--at least, Ithink so--serving God, and aware of the vanity of the world, allhas been pleasant, as I shall show hereafter. [1]5. The reason, then, of my telling this at so great a length isthat, as I have just said, [2] the mercy of God and myingratitude, on the one hand, may become known; and, on theother, that men may understand how great is the good which Godworks in a soul when He gives it a disposition to pray inearnest, though it may not be so well prepared as it ought to be.If that soul perseveres in spite of sins, temptations, andrelapses, brought about in a thousand ways by Satan, our Lordwill bring it at last--I am certain of it--to the harbour ofsalvation, as He has brought me myself; for so it seems to menow.  May His Majesty grant I may never go back and be lost!He who gives himself to prayer is in possession of a greatblessing, of which many saintly and good men have written--I amspeaking of mental prayer--glory be to God for it; and, if theyhad not done so, I am not proud enough, though I have but littlehumility, to presume to discuss it.6. I may speak of that which I know by experience; and so I say,let him never cease from prayer who has once begun it, be hislife ever so wicked; for prayer is the way to amend it, andwithout prayer such amendment will be much more difficult.Let him not be tempted by Satan, as I was, to give it up, on thepretence of humility; [3] let him rather believe that His wordsare true Who says that, if we truly repent, and resolve never tooffend Him, He will take us into His favour again, [4] give usthe graces He gave us before, and occasionally even greater, ifour repentance deserve it.  And as to him who has not begun topray, I implore him by the love of our Lord not to deprivehimself of so great a good.7. Herein there is nothing to be afraid of, but everything tohope for.  Granting that such a one does not advance, nor make aneffort to become perfect, so as to merit the joys andconsolations which the perfect receive from God, yet he will bylittle and little attain to a knowledge of the road which leadsto heaven.  And if he perseveres, I hope in the mercy of God forhim, seeing that no one ever took Him for his friend that was notamply rewarded; for mental prayer is nothing else, in my opinion,but being on terms of friendship with God, frequently conversingin secret with Him Who, we know, loves us.  Now, true love andlasting friendship require certain dispositions: those of ourLord, we know, are absolutely perfect; ours, vicious, sensual,and thankless; and you cannot therefore, bring yourselves to loveHim as He loves you, because you have not the disposition to doso; and if you do not love Him, yet, seeing how much it concernsyou to have His friendship, and how great is His love for you,rise above that pain you feel at being much with Him Who is sodifferent from you.8. O infinite goodness of my God!  I seem to see Thee and myselfin this relation to one another.  O Joy of the angels! when Iconsider it, I wish I could wholly die of love!  How true it isthat Thou endurest those who will not endure Thee!  Oh, how gooda friend art Thou, O my Lord! how Thou comfortest and endurest,and also waitest for them to make themselves like unto Thee, andyet, in the meanwhile, art Thyself so patient of the state theyare in!  Thou takest into account the occasions during which theyseek Thee, and for a moment of penitence forgettest theiroffences against Thyself.9. I have seen this distinctly in my own case, and I cannot tellwhy the whole world does not labour to draw near to Thee in thisparticular friendship.  The wicked, who do not resemble Thee,ought to do so, in order that Thou mayest make them good, and forthat purpose should permit Thee to remain with them at least fortwo hours daily, even though they may not remain with Thee but,as I used to do, with a thousand distractions, and with worldlythoughts.  In return for this violence which they offer tothemselves for the purpose of remaining in a company so good asThine--for at first they can do no more, and even afterwards attimes--Thou, O Lord, defendest them against the assaults of evilspirits, whose power Thou restrainest, and even lessenest daily,giving to them the victory over these their enemies.  So it is, OLife of all lives, Thou slayest none that put their trust inThee, and seek Thy friendship; yea, rather, Thou sustainest theirbodily life in greater vigour, and makest their soul to live.10. I do not understand what there can be to make them afraid whoare afraid to begin mental prayer, nor do I know what it is theydread.  The devil does well to bring this fear upon us, that hemay really hurt us by putting me in fear, he can make me ceasefrom thinking of my offences against God, of the great debt I oweHim, of the existence of heaven and hell, and of the greatsorrows and trials He underwent for me.  That was all my prayer,and had been, when I was in this dangerous state, and it was onthose subjects I dwelt whenever I could; and very often, for someyears, I was more occupied with the wish to see the end of thetime I had appointed for myself to spend in prayer, and inwatching the hour-glass, than with other thoughts that were good.If a sharp penance had been laid upon me, I know of none that Iwould not very often have willingly undertaken, rather thanprepare myself for prayer by self-recollection.  And certainlythe violence with which Satan assailed me was so irresistible, ormy evil habits were so strong, that I did not betake myself toprayer; and the sadness I felt on entering the oratory was sogreat, that it required all the courage I had to force myself in.They say of me that my courage is not slight, and it is knownthat God has given me a courage beyond that of a woman; but Ihave made a bad use of it.  In the end, our Lord came to my help;and then, when I had done this violence to myself, I foundgreater peace and joy than I sometimes had when I had a desireto pray.11. If, then, our Lord bore so long with me, who was sowicked--and it is plain that it was by prayer all my evil wascorrected--why should any one, how wicked soever he may be, haveany fear? Let him be ever so wicked, he will not remain in hiswickedness so many years as I did, after receiving so many gracesfrom our Lord.  Is there any one who can despair, when He bore solong with me, only because I desired and contrived to find someplace and some opportunities for Him to be alone with me--andthat very often against my will? for I did violence to myself, orrather our Lord Himself did violence to me.12. If, then, to those who do not serve God, but rather offendHim, prayer be all this, and so necessary, and if no one canreally find out any harm it can do him, and if the omission of itbe not a still greater harm, why, then, should they abstain fromit who serve and desire to serve God?  Certainly I cannotcomprehend it, unless it be that men have a mind to go throughthe troubles of this life in greater misery, and to shut the doorin the face of God, so that He shall give them no comfort in it.I am most truly sorry for them, because they serve God at theirown cost; for of those who pray, God Himself defrays the charges,seeing that for a little trouble He gives sweetness, in orderthat, by the help it supplies, they may bear their trials.13. But because I have much to say hereafter of this sweetness,which our Lord gives to those who persevere in prayer, [5] I donot speak of it here; only this will I say: prayer is the door tothose great graces which our Lord bestowed upon me.  If this doorbe shut, I do not see how He can bestow them; for even if Heentered into a soul to take His delight therein, and to make thatsoul also delight in Him, there is no way by which He can do so;for His will is, that such a soul should be lonely and pure, witha great desire to receive His graces.  If we put many hindrancesin the way, and take no pains whatever to remove them, how can Hecome to us, and how can we have any desire that He should show usHis great mercies?14. I will speak now--for it is very important to understandit--of the assaults which Satan directs against a soul for thepurpose of taking it, and of the contrivances and compassionwherewith our Lord labours to convert it to Himself, in orderthat men may behold His mercy, and the great good it was for methat I did not give up prayer and spiritual reading, and thatthey may be on their guard against the dangers against which Iwas not on my guard myself.  And, above all, I implore them forthe love of our Lord, and for the great love with which He goethabout seeking our conversion to Himself, to beware of theoccasions of sin; for once placed therein, we have no ground torest on--so many enemies then assail us, and our own weakness issuch, that we cannot defend ourselves.15. Oh, that I knew how to describe the captivity of my soul inthose days!  I understood perfectly that I was in captivity, butI could not understand the nature of it; neither could I entirelybelieve that those things which my confessors did not make somuch of were so wrong as I in my soul felt them to be. One ofthem--I had gone to him with a scruple--told me that, even if Iwere raised to high contemplation, those occasions andconversations were not unfitting for me.  This was towards theend, when, by the grace of God, I was withdrawing more and morefrom those great dangers, but not wholly from the occasionsof them.16. When they saw my good desires, and how I occupied myself inprayer, I seemed to them to have done much; but my soul knew thatthis was not doing what I was bound to do for Him to Whom I owedso much.  I am sorry for my poor soul even now, because of itsgreat sufferings, and the little help it had from any one exceptGod, and for the wide door that man opened for it, that it mightgo forth to its pastimes and pleasures, when they said that thesethings were lawful.17. Then there was the torture of sermons, and that not a slightone; for I was very fond of them.  If I heard any one preach welland with unction, I felt, without my seeking it, a particularaffection for him, neither do I know whence it came.  Thus, nosermon ever seemed to me so bad, but that I listened to it withpleasure; though, according to others who heard it, the preachingwas not good.  If it was a good sermon, it was to me a mostspecial refreshment.  To speak of God, or to hear Him spoken of,never wearied me.  I am speaking of the time after I gave myselfto prayer.  At one time I had great comfort in sermons, atanother they distressed me, because they made me feel that I wasvery far from being what I ought to have been.18. I used to pray to our Lord for help; but, as it now seems tome, I must have committed the fault of not putting my whole trustin His Majesty, and of not thoroughly distrusting myself.I sought for help, took great pains; but it must be that I didnot understand how all is of little profit if we do not root outall confidence in ourselves, and place it wholly in God. I wishedto live, but I saw clearly that I was not living, but ratherwrestling with the shadow of death; there was no one to give melife, and I was not able to take it.  He Who could have given itme had good reasons for not coming to my aid, seeing that He hadbrought me back to Himself so many times, and I as often hadleft Him.1. Ch. ix. § 10.2. § 1, above.3.

ISFJ	 IX.The Means Whereby Our Lord Quickened Her Soul, Gave Her Light inHer Darkness, and Made Her Strong in Goodness.1. My soul was now grown weary; and the miserable habits it hadcontracted would not suffer it to rest, though it was desirous ofdoing so.  It came to pass one day, when I went into the oratory,that I saw a picture which they had put by there, and which hadbeen procured for a certain feast observed in the house.  It wasa representation of Christ most grievously wounded; and sodevotional, that the very sight of it, when I saw it, movedme--so well did it show forth that which He suffered for us.So keenly did I feel the evil return I had made for those wounds,that I thought my heart was breaking.  I threw myself on theground beside it, my tears flowing plenteously, and implored Himto strengthen me once for all, so that I might never offend Himany more.2. I had a very great devotion to the glorious Magdalene, andvery frequently used to think of her conversion--especially whenI went to Communion.  As I knew for certain that our Lord wasthen within me, I used to place myself at His feet, thinking thatmy tears would not be despised.  I did not know what I wassaying; only He did great things for me, in that He was pleased Ishould shed those tears, seeing that I so soon forgot thatimpression.  I used to recommend myself to that glorious Saint,that she might obtain my pardon.3. But this last time, before that picture of which I amspeaking, I seem to have made greater progress; for I was nowvery distrustful of myself, placing all my confidence in God.It seems to me that I said to Him then that I would not rise uptill He granted my petition.  I do certainly believe that thiswas of great service to me, because I have grown betterever since. [1]4. This was my method of prayer: as I could not make reflectionswith my understanding, I contrived to picture Christ as withinme; [2] and I used to find myself the better for thinking ofthose mysteries of His life during which He was most lonely.It seemed to me that the being alone and afflicted, like a personin trouble, must needs permit me to come near unto Him.5. I did many simple things of this kind; and in particular Iused to find myself most at home in the prayer in the Garden,whither I went in His company.  I thought of the bloody sweat,and of the affliction He endured there; I wished, if it had beenpossible, to wipe away that painful sweat from His face; but Iremember that I never dared to form such a resolution--my sinsstood before me so grievously.  I used to remain with Him thereas long as my thoughts allowed me, and I had many thoughts totorment me.  For many years, nearly every night before I fellasleep, when I recommended myself to God, that I might sleep inpeace, I used always to think a little of this mystery of theprayer in the Garden--yea, even before I was a nun, because I hadbeen told that many indulgences were to be gained thereby.For my part, I believe that my soul gained very much in this way,because I began to practise prayer without knowing what it was;and now that it had become my constant habit, I was saved fromomitting it, as I was from omitting to bless myself with the signof the cross before I slept.6. And now to go back to what I was saying of the torture whichmy thoughts inflicted upon me.  This method of praying, in whichthe understanding makes no reflections, hath this property: thesoul must gain much, or lose.  I mean, that those who advancewithout meditation, make great progress, because it is done bylove.  But to attain to this involves great labour, except tothose persons whom it is our Lord's good pleasure to lead quicklyto the prayer of quiet.  I know of some.  For those who walk inthis way, a book is profitable, that by the help thereof they maythe more quickly recollect themselves.  It was a help to me alsoto look on fields, water, and flowers. [3] In them I saw tracesof the Creator--I mean, that the sight of these things was as abook unto me; it roused me, made me recollected, and reminded meof my ingratitude and of my sins.  My understanding was so dull,that I could never represent in the imagination either heavenlyor high things in any form whatever until our Lord placed thembefore me in another way. [4]7. I was so little able to put things before me by the help of myunderstanding, that, unless I saw a thing with my eyes, myimagination was of no use whatever.  I could not do as others do,who can put matters before themselves so as to become therebyrecollected.  I was able to think of Christ only as man.  But soit was; and I never could form any image of Him to myself, thoughI read much of His beauty, and looked at pictures of Him.  I waslike one who is blind, or in the dark, who, though speaking to aperson present, and feeling his presence, because he knows forcertain that he is present--I mean, that he understands him to bepresent, and believes it--yet does not see him.  It was thus withme when I used to think of our Lord.  This is why I was so fondof images.  Wretched are they who, through their own fault, havelost this blessing; it is clear enough that they do not love ourLord--for if they loved Him, they would rejoice at the sight ofHis picture, just as men find pleasure when they see the portraitof one they love.8. At this time, the Confessions of St. Augustine were given me.Our Lord seems to have so ordained it, for I did not seek themmyself, neither had I ever seen them before.  I had a very greatdevotion to St. Augustine, because the monastery in which I livedwhen I was yet in the world was of his Order; [5] and alsobecause he had been a sinner--for I used to find great comfort inthose Saints whom, after they had sinned, our Lord converted toHimself.  I thought they would help me, and that, as our Lord hadforgiven them, so also He would forgive me.  One thing, however,there was that troubled me--I have spoken of it before [6]--ourLord had called them but once, and they never relapsed; while myrelapses were now so many.  This it was that vexed me.But calling to mind the love that He bore me, I took courageagain. Of His mercy I never doubted once, but I did very oftenof myself.9. O my God, I amazed at the hardness of my heart amidst so manysuccours from Thee.  I am filled with dread when I see how littleI could do with myself, and how I was clogged, so that I couldnot resolve to give myself entirely to God.  When I began to readthe Confessions, I thought I saw myself there described, andbegan to recommend myself greatly to this glorious Saint. When Icame to his conversion, and read how he heard that voice in thegarden, it seemed to me nothing less than that our Lord haduttered it for me: I felt so in my heart.  I remained for sometime lost in tears, in great inward affliction and distress. O myGod, what a soul has to suffer because it has lost the liberty ithad of being mistress over itself! and what torments it has toendure!  I wonder now how I could live in torments so great: Godbe praised Who gave me life, so that I might escape from so fatala death!  I believe that my soul obtained great strength from HisDivine Majesty, and that He must have heard my cry, and hadcompassion upon so many tears.10. A desire to spend more time with Him began to grow within me,and also to withdraw from the occasions of sin: for as soon as Ihad done so, I turned lovingly to His Majesty at once.I understood clearly, as I thought, that I loved Him; but I didnot understand, as I ought to have understood it, wherein thetrue love of God consists.  I do not think I had yet perfectlydisposed myself to seek His service when His Majesty turnedtowards me with His consolations.  What others strive after withgreat labour, our Lord seems to have looked out for a way to makeme willing to accept--that is, in these later years to give mejoy and comfort.  But as for asking our Lord to give me eitherthese things or sweetness in devotion, I never dared to do it;the only thing I prayed Him to give me was the grace never tooffend Him, together with the forgiveness of my great sins.When I saw that my sins were so great, I never ventureddeliberately to ask for consolation or for sweetness.  He hadcompassion enough upon me, I think--and, in truth, He dealt withme according to His great mercy--when He allowed me to standbefore Him, and when He drew me into His presence; for I sawthat, if He had not drawn me, I should not have come at all.11. Once only in my life do I remember asking for consolation,being at the time in great aridities.  When I considered what Ihad done, I was so confounded, that the very distress I sufferedfrom seeing how little humility I had, brought me that which Ihad been so bold as to ask for.  I knew well that it was lawfulto pray for it; but it seemed to me that it is lawful only forthose who are in good dispositions, who have sought with alltheir might to attain to true devotion--that is, not to offendGod, and to be disposed and resolved for all goodness.  I lookedupon those tears of mine as womanish and weak, seeing that I didnot obtain my desires by them; nevertheless, I believe that theydid me some service; for, specially after those two occasions ofgreat compunction and sorrow of heart, [7] accompanied by tears,of which I am speaking, I began in an especial way to give myselfmore to prayer, and to occupy myself less with those things whichdid me harm--though I did not give them up altogether.  But GodHimself, as I have just said, came to my aid, and helped me toturn away from them.  As His Majesty was only waiting for somepreparation on my part, the spiritual graces grew in me as Ishall now explain.  It is not the custom of our Lord to givethese graces to any but to those who keep their consciences ingreater pureness. [8]1. In the year 1555 (Bouix).2. See ch. iv. § 10; ch. x. § 1.3.

ISFJ	 X.The Graces She Received in Prayer.  What We Can Do Ourselves.The Great Importance of Understanding What Our Lord Is Doingfor Us.  She Desires Her Confessors to Keep Her Writings Secret,Because of the Special Graces of Our Lord to Her, Which They HadCommanded Her to Describe.1. I used to have at times, as I have said, [1] though it used topass quickly away--certain commencements of that which I am goingnow to describe.  When I formed those pictures within myself ofthrowing myself at the feet of Christ, as I said before, [2] andsometimes even when I was reading, a feeling of the presence ofGod would come over me unexpectedly, so that I could in no wisedoubt either that He was within me, or that I was wholly absorbedin Him.  It was not by way of vision; I believe it was what iscalled mystical theology.   The soul is suspended in such a waythat it seems to be utterly beside itself.  The will loves; thememory, so it seems to me, is as it were lost; and theunderstanding, so I think, makes no reflections--yet is not lost:as I have just said, it is not at work, but it stands as ifamazed at the greatness of the things it understands; for Godwills it to understand that it understands nothing whatever ofthat which His Majesty places before it.2. Before this, I had a certain tenderness of soul which was veryabiding, partially attainable, I believe, in some measure, by ourown efforts: a consolation which is not wholly in the senses, noryet altogether in the spirit, but is all of it the gift of God.However, I think we can contribute much towards the attaining ofit by considering our vileness and our ingratitude towardsGod--the great things He has done for us--His Passion, with itsgrievous pains--and His life, so full of sorrows; also, byrejoicing in the contemplation of His works, of His greatness,and of the love that He bears us.  Many other considerationsthere are which he who really desires to make progress will oftenstumble on, though he may not be very much on the watch for them.If with this there be a little love, the soul is comforted, theheart is softened, and tears flow.  Sometimes it seems that we doviolence to ourselves and weep; at other times, our Lord seems todo so, so that we have no power to resist Him.  His Majesty seemsto reward this slight carefulness of ours with so grand a gift asis this consolation which He ministers to the soul of seeingitself weeping for so great a Lord.  I am not surprised; for thesoul has reason enough, and more than enough, for its joy.  Hereit comforts itself--here it rejoices.3. The comparison which now presents itself seems to me to begood.  These joys in prayer are like what those of heaven mustbe.  As the vision of the saints, which is measured by theirmerits there, reaches no further than our Lord wills, and as theblessed see how little merit they had, every one of them issatisfied with the place assigned him: there being the verygreatest difference between one joy and another in heaven, andmuch greater than between one spiritual joy and another onearth--which is, however, very great.  And in truth, in thebeginning, a soul in which God works this grace thinks that nowit has scarcely anything more to desire, and counts itselfabundantly rewarded for all the service it has rendered Him.And there is reason for this: for one of those tears--which, as Ihave just said, are almost in our own power, though without Godnothing can be done--cannot, in my opinion, be purchased with allthe labours of the world, because of the great gain it brings us.And what greater gain can we have than some testimony of ourhaving pleased God?  Let him, then, who shall have attained tothis, give praise unto God--acknowledge himself to be one of Hisgreatest debtors; because it seems to be His will to take himinto His house, having chosen him for His kingdom, if he does notturn back.4. Let him not regard certain kinds of humility which exist, andof which I mean to speak. [3]  Some think it humility not tobelieve that God is bestowing His gifts upon them.  Let usclearly understand this, and that it is perfectly clear Godbestows His gifts without any merit whatever on our part; and letus be grateful to His Majesty for them; for if we do notrecognize the gifts received at His hands, we shall never bemoved to love Him.  It is a most certain truth, that the richerwe see ourselves to be, confessing at the same time our poverty,the greater will be our progress, and the more real our humility.5. An opposite course tends to take away all courage; for weshall think ourselves incapable of great blessings, if we beginto frighten ourselves with the dread of vain-glory when our Lordbegins to show His mercy upon us. [4]  Let us believe that He Whogives these gifts will also, when the devil begins to tempt usherein, give us the grace to detect him, and the strength toresist him--that is, He will do so if we walk in simplicitybefore God, aiming at pleasing Him only, and not men.  It is amost evident truth, that our love for a person is greater, themore distinctly we remember the good he has done us.6. If, then, it is lawful, and so meritorious, always to rememberthat we have our being from God, that He has created us out ofnothing, that He preserves us, and also to remember all thebenefits of His death and Passion, which He suffered long beforeHe made us for every one of us now alive--why should it not belawful for me to discern, confess, and consider often that I wasonce accustomed to speak of vanities, and that now our Lord hasgiven me the grace to speak only of Himself?7. Here, then, is a precious pearl, which, when we remember thatit is given us, and that we have it in possession, powerfullyinvites us to love.  All this is the fruit of prayer founded onhumility.  What, then, will it be when we shall find ourselves inpossession of other pearls of greater price, such as contempt ofthe world and of self, which some servants of God have alreadyreceived?  It is clear that such souls must consider themselvesgreater debtors--under greater obligations to serve Him: we mustacknowledge that we have nothing of ourselves, and confess themunificence of our Lord, Who, on a soul so wretched and poor, andso utterly undeserving, as mine is,--for whom the first of thesepearls was enough, and more than enough,--would bestow greaterriches than I could desire.8. We must renew our strength to serve Him, and strive not to beungrateful, because it is on this condition that our Lorddispenses His treasures; for if we do not make a good use ofthem, and of the high estate to which He raises us, He willreturn and take them from us, and we shall be poorer than ever.His Majesty will give the pearls to him who shall bring themforth and employ them usefully for himself and others.  For howshall he be useful, and how shall he spend liberally, who doesnot know that he is rich?  It is not possible, I think, ournature being what it is, that he can have the courage necessaryfor great things who does not know that God is on his side; forso miserable are we, so inclined to the things of this world,that he can hardly have any real abhorrence of, with greatdetachment from, all earthly things who does not see that heholds some pledges for those things that are above.  It is bythese gifts that our Lord gives us that strength which we throughour sins have lost.9. A man will hardly wish to be held in contempt and abhorrence,nor will he seek after the other great virtues to which theperfect attain, if he has not some pledges of the love which Godbears him, together with a living faith.  Our nature is so dead,that we go after that which we see immediately before us; and itis these graces, therefore, that quicken and strengthen ourfaith.  It may well be that I, who am so wicked, measure othersby myself, and that others require nothing more than the veritiesof the faith, in order to render their works most perfect; whileI, wretched that I am! have need of everything.10. Others will explain this.  I speak from my own experience, asI have been commanded; and if what I say be not correct, lethim [5] to whom I send it destroy it; for he knows better than Ido what is wrong in it.  I entreat him, for the love of our Lord,to publish abroad what I have thus far said of my wretched life,and of my sins.  I give him leave to do so; and to all myconfessors, also,--of whom he is one--to whom this is to be sent,if it be their pleasure, even during my life, so that I may nolonger deceive people who think there must be some good inme.  [6] Certainly, I speak in all sincerity, so far as Iunderstand myself.  Such publication will give me great comfort.11. But as to that which I am now going to say, I give no suchleave; nor, if it be shown to any one, do I consent to its beingsaid who the person is whose experience it describes, nor whowrote it.  This is why I mention neither my own name, nor that ofany other person whatever.  I have written it in the best way Icould, in order not to be known; and this I beg of them for thelove of God.  Persons so learned and grave as they are [7] haveauthority enough to approve of whatever right things I may say,should our Lord give me the grace to do so; and if I should sayanything of the kind, it will be His, and not mine--because I amneither learned nor of good life, and I have no person oflearning or any other to teach me; for they only who ordered meto write know that I am writing, and at this moment they are nothere.  I have, as it were, to steal the time, and that withdifficulty, because my writing hinders me from spinning.  I amliving in a house that is poor, and have many things to do. [8]If, indeed, our Lord had given me greater abilities and a bettermemory, I might then profit by what I have seen and read; but myabilities are very slight.  If, then, I should say anything thatis right, our Lord will have it said for some good purpose; thatwhich may be wrong will be mine, and your reverence will strikeit out.12. In neither case will it be of any use to publish my name:during my life, it is clear that no good I may have done ought tobe told; after death, there is no reason against it, except thatit will lose all authority and credit, because related of aperson so vile and so wicked as I am.  And because I think yourreverence and the others who may see this writing will do thisthat I ask of you, for the love of our Lord, I write withfreedom.  If it were not so, I should have great scruples, exceptin declaring my sins: and in that matter I should have none atall.  For the rest, it is enough that I am a woman to make mysails droop: how much more, then, when I am a woman, and awicked one?13. So, then, everything here beyond the simple story of my lifeyour reverence must take upon yourself--since you have so pressedme to give some account of the graces which our Lord bestowedupon me in prayer--if it be consistent with the truths of ourholy Catholic faith; if it be not, your reverence must burn it atonce--for I give my consent.  I will recount my experience, inorder that, if it be consistent with those truths, your reverencemay make some use of it; if not, you will deliver my soul fromdelusion, so that Satan may gain nothing there where I seemed tobe gaining myself.  Our Lord knows well that I, as I shall showhereafter, [9] have always laboured to find out those who couldgive me light.14. How clear soever I may wish to make my account of that whichrelates to prayer, it will be obscure enough for those who arewithout experience.  I shall speak of certain hindrances, which,as I understand it, keep men from advancing on this road--and ofother things which are dangerous, as our Lord has taught me byexperience.  I have also discussed the matter with men of greatlearning, with persons who for many years had lived spirituallives, who admit that, in the twenty-seven years only duringwhich I have given myself to prayer--though I walked so ill, andstumbled so often on the road--His Majesty granted me thatexperience which others attain to in seven-and-thirty, orseven-and-forty, years; and they, too, being persons who everadvanced in the way of penance and of virtue.15. Blessed be God for all, and may His infinite Majesty make useof me!  Our Lord knoweth well that I have no other end in thisthan that He may be praised and magnified a little, when menshall see that on a dunghill so foul and rank He has made agarden of flowers so sweet.  May it please His Majesty that I maynot by my own fault root them out, and become again what I wasbefore.  And I entreat your reverence, for the love of our Lord,to beg this of Him for me, seeing that you have a clearerknowledge of what I am than you have allowed me to give ofmyself here.1.

ISFJ	 XI.Why Men Do Not Attain Quickly to the Perfect Love of God.Of Four Degrees of Prayer.  Of the First Degree.  The DoctrineProfitable for Beginners, and for Those Who Have NoSensible Sweetness.1. I speak now of those who begin to be the servants of love;that seems to me to be nothing else but to resolve to follow Himin the way of prayer, who has loved us so much.  It is a dignityso great, that I have a strange joy in thinking of it; forservile fear vanishes at once, if we are, as we ought to be, inthe first degree.  O Lord of my soul, and my good, how is itthat, when a soul is determined to love Thee--doing all it can,by forsaking all things, in order that it may the better occupyitself with the love of God--it is not Thy will it should havethe joy of ascending at once to the possession of perfect love?I have spoken amiss; I ought to have said, and my complaintshould have been, why is it we do not? for the fault is whollyour own that we do not rejoice at once in a dignity so great,seeing that the attaining to the perfect possession of this truelove brings all blessings with it.2. We think so much of ourselves, and are so dilatory in givingourselves wholly to God, that, as His Majesty will not let ushave the fruition of that which is so precious but at a greatcost, so neither do we perfectly prepare ourselves for it.  I seeplainly that there is nothing by which so great a good can beprocured in this world.  If, however, we did what we could, notclinging to anything upon earth, but having all our thoughts andconversation in Heaven, I believe that this blessing wouldquickly be given us, provided we perfectly prepared ourselves forit at once, as some of the saints have done.  We think we aregiving all to God; but, in fact, we are offering only the revenueor the produce, while we retain the fee-simple of the land in ourown possession.3. We resolve to become poor, and it is a resolution of greatmerit; but we very often take great care not to be in want, notsimply of what is necessary, but of what is superfluous: yea, andto make for ourselves friends who may supply us; and in this waywe take more pains, and perhaps expose ourselves to greaterdanger, in order that we may want nothing, than we did formerly,when we had our own possessions in our own power.4. We thought, also, that we gave up all desire of honour when webecame religious, or when we began the spiritual life, andfollowed after perfection; and yet, when we are touched on thepoint of honour, we do not then remember that we had given it upto God.  We would seize it again, and take it, as they say, outof His Hands, even after we had made Him, to all appearance, theLord of our own will.  So is it in every thing else.5. A pleasant way this of seeking the love of God! we retain ourown affections, and yet will have that love, as they say, byhandfuls.  We make no efforts to bring our desires to goodeffect, or to raise them resolutely above the earth; and yet,with all this, we must have many spiritual consolations.  This isnot well, and we are seeking things that are incompatible onewith the other.  So, because we do not give ourselves up whollyand at once, this treasure is not given wholly and at once to us.May it be the good pleasure of our Lord to give it us drop bydrop, though it may cost us all the trials in the world.6. He showeth great mercy unto him to whom He gives the grace andresolution to strive for this blessing with all his might; forGod withholds Himself from no one who perseveres.  He will bylittle and little strengthen that soul, so that it may come forthvictorious.  I say resolution, because of the multitude of thosethings which Satan puts before it at first, to keep it back frombeginning to travel on this road; for he knoweth what harm willbefall him thereby--he will lose not only that soul, but manyothers also.  If he who enters on this road does violence tohimself, with the help of God, so as to reach the summit ofperfection, such a one, I believe, will never go alone to Heaven;he will always take many with him: God gives to him, as to a goodcaptain, those who shall be of his company.7. Thus, then, the dangers and difficulties which Satan putsbefore them are so many, that they have need, not of a little,but of a very great, resolution, and great grace from God, tosave them from falling away.8. Speaking, then, of their beginnings who are determined tofollow after this good, and to succeed in their enterprise--whatI began to say [1] of mystical theology--I believe they call itby that name--I shall proceed with hereafter--I have to say thatthe labour is greatest at first; for it is they who toil, ourLord, indeed, giving them strength.  In the other degrees ofprayer, there is more of fruition; although they who are in thebeginning, the middle, and the end, have their crosses to carry:the crosses, however, are different.  They who would followChrist, if they do not wish to be lost, must walk in the way Hewalked Himself.  Blessed labours! even here, in this life, sosuperabundantly rewarded!9. I shall have to make use of a comparison; I should like toavoid it, because I am a woman, and write simply what I have beencommanded.  But this language of spirituality is so difficult ofutterance for those who are not learned, and such am I.  I havetherefore to seek for some means to make the matter plain.It may be that the comparison will very rarely be to thepurpose--your reverence will be amused when you see my stupidity.I think, now, I have either read or heard of this comparison; butas my memory is bad, I know not where, nor on what occasion;however, I am satisfied with it for my present purpose. [2]10. A beginner must look upon himself as making a garden, whereinour Lord may take His delight, but in a soil unfruitful, andabounding in weeds.  His Majesty roots up the weeds, and has toplant good herbs.  Let us, then, take for granted that this isalready done when a soul is determined to give itself to prayer,and has begun the practice of it.  We have, then, as goodgardeners, by the help of God, to see that the plants grow, towater them carefully, that they may not die, but produceblossoms, which shall send forth much fragrance, refreshing toour Lord, so that He may come often for His pleasure into thisgarden, and delight Himself in the midst of these virtues.11. Let us now see how this garden is to be watered, that we mayunderstand what we have to do: how much trouble it will cost us,whether the gain be greater than the trouble, or how long a timeit will take us.  It seems to me that the garden may be wateredin four ways: by water taken out of a well, which is verylaborious; or with water raised by means of an engine andbuckets, drawn by a windlass--I have drawn it this waysometimes--it is a less troublesome way than the first, and givesmore water; or by a stream or brook, whereby the garden iswatered in a much better way--for the soil is more thoroughlysaturated, and there is no necessity to water it so often, andthe labour of the gardener is much less; or by showers of rain,when our Lord Himself waters it, without labour on our part--andthis way is incomparably better than all the others of which Ihave spoken.12. Now, then, for the application of these four ways ofirrigation by which the garden is to be maintained; for withoutwater it must fail.  The comparison is to my purpose, and itseems to me that by the help of it I shall be able to explain, insome measure, the four degrees of prayer to which our Lord, ofHis goodness, has occasionally raised my soul.  May He graciouslygrant that I may so speak as to be of some service to one ofthose who has commanded me to write, whom our Lord has raised infour months to a greater height than I have reached in seventeenyears!  He prepared himself better than I did, and therefore ishis garden without labour on his part, irrigated by these fourwaters--though the last of them is only drop by drop; but it isgrowing in such a way, that soon, by the help of our Lord, hewill be swallowed up therein, and it will be a pleasure to me, ifhe finds my explanation absurd, that he should laugh at it.13. Of those who are beginners in prayer, we may say, that theyare those who draw the water up out of the well--a process which,as I have said, is very laborious; for they must be wearied inkeeping the senses recollected, and this is a great labour,because the senses have been hitherto accustomed to distractions.It is necessary for beginners to accustom themselves to disregardwhat they hear or see, and to put it away from them during thetime of prayer; they must be alone, and in retirement think overtheir past life.  Though all must do this many times, beginnersas well as those more advanced; all, however, must not do soequally, as I shall show hereafter. [3] Beginners at first suffermuch, because they are not convinced that they are penitent fortheir sins; and yet they are, because they are so sincerelyresolved on serving God.  They must strive to meditate on thelife of Christ, and the understanding is wearied thereby.Thus far we can advance of ourselves--that is, by the grace ofGod--for without that, as every one knows, we never can have onegood thought.14. This is beginning to draw water up out of the well.God grant there may be water in it!  That, however, does notdepend on us; we are drawing it, and doing what we can towardswatering the flowers.  So good is God, that when, for reasonsknown to His Majesty--perhaps for our greater good--it is Hiswill the well should be dry, He Himself preserves the flowerswithout water--we, like good gardeners, doing what lies in ourpower--and makes our virtues grow.  By water here I mean tears,and if there be none, then tenderness and an inward feelingof devotion.15. What, then, will he do here who sees that, for many days, heis conscious only of aridity, disgust, dislike, and so great anunwillingness to go to the well for water, that he would give itup altogether, if he did not remember that he has to please andserve the Lord of the garden; if he did not trust that hisservice was not in vain, and did not hope for some gain by alabour so great as that of lowering the bucket into the well sooften, and drawing it up without water in it?  It will happenthat he is often unable to move his arms for that purpose, or tohave one good thought: working with the understanding is drawingwater out of the well.16. What, then, once more, will the gardener do now?  He mustrejoice and take comfort, and consider it as the greatest favourto labour in the garden of so great an Emperor; and as he knowsthat he is pleasing Him in the matter--and his purpose must notbe to please himself, but Him--let him praise Him greatly for thetrust He has in him--for He sees that, without any recompense, heis taking so much care of that which has been confided to him;let him help Him to carry the Cross, and let him think how Hecarried it all His life long; let him not seek his kingdom here,nor ever intermit his prayer; and so let him resolve, if thisaridity should last even his whole life long, never to let Christfall down beneath the Cross. [4]17. The time will come when he shall be paid once for all.Let him have no fear that his labour is in vain: he serves a goodMaster, Whose eyes are upon him.  Let him make no account of evilthoughts, but remember that Satan suggested them to St. Jeromealso in the desert. [5]  These labours have their reward, I knowit; for I am one who underwent them for many years.  When I drewbut one drop of water out of this blessed well, I considered itwas a mercy of God.  I know these labours are very great, andrequire, I think, greater courage than many others in this world;but I have seen clearly that God does not leave them without agreat recompense, even in this life; for it is very certain thatin one hour, during which our Lord  gave me to taste Hissweetness, all the anxieties which I had to bear when perseveringin prayer seem to me ever afterwards perfectly rewarded.18. I believe that it is our Lord's good pleasure frequently inthe beginning, and at times in the end, to send these torments,and many other incidental temptations, to try those who love Him,and to ascertain if they will drink the chalice, [6] and help Himto carry the Cross, before He intrusts them with His greattreasures.  I believe it to be for our good that His Majestyshould lead us by this way, so that we may perfectly understandhow worthless we are; for the graces which He gives afterwardsare of a dignity so great, that He will have us by experienceknow our wretchedness before He grants them, that it may not bewith us as it was with Lucifer.19. What canst Thou do, O my Lord, that is not for the greatergood of that soul which Thou knowest to be already Thine, andwhich gives itself up to Thee to follow Thee whithersoever Thougoest, even to the death of the Cross; and which is determined tohelp Thee to carry that Cross, and not to leave Thee alone withit?  He who shall discern this resolution in himself has nothingto fear: no, no; spiritual people have nothing to fear.  There isno reason why he should be distressed who is already raised to sohigh a degree as this is of wishing to converse in solitude withGod, and to abandon the amusements of the world.  The greaterpart of the work is done; give praise to His Majesty for it, andtrust in His goodness who has never failed those who love Him.Close the eyes of your imagination, and do not ask why He givesdevotion to this person in so short a time, and none to me afterso many years.  Let us believe that all is for our greater good;let His Majesty guide us whithersoever He will: we are not ourown, but His.  He shows us mercy enough when it is His pleasurewe should be willing to dig in His garden, and to be so near theLord of it: He certainly is near to us.  If it be His will thatthese plants and flowers should grow--some of them when He giveswater we may draw from the well, others when He gives none--whatis that to me?  Do Thou, O Lord, accomplish Thy will; let menever offend Thee, nor let my virtues perish; if Thou hast givenme any, it is out of Thy mere goodness.  I wish to suffer,because Thou, O Lord, hast suffered; do Thou in every way fulfilThy will in me, and may it never be the pleasure of Thy Majestythat a gift of so high a price as that of Thy love, be given topeople who serve Thee only because of the sweetness theyfind thereby.20. It is much to be observed, and I say so because I know byexperience, that the soul which, begins to walk in the way ofmental prayer with resolution, and is determined not to caremuch, neither to rejoice nor to be greatly afflicted, whethersweetness and tenderness fail it, or our Lord grants them, hasalready travelled a great part of the road.  Let that soul, then,have no fear that it is going back, though it may frequentlystumble; for the building is begun on a firm foundation.  It iscertain that the love of God does not consist in tears, nor inthis sweetness and tenderness which we for the most part desire,and with which we console ourselves; but rather in serving Him injustice, fortitude, and humility.  That seems to me to be areceiving rather than a giving of anything on our part.21. As for poor women, such as I am, weak and infirm of purpose,it seems to me to be necessary that I should be led on throughconsolations, as God is doing now, so that I might be able toendure certain afflictions which it has pleased His Majesty Ishould have.  But when the servants of God, who are men ofweight, learning, and sense, make so much account, as I see theydo, whether God gives them sweetness in devotion or not, I amdisgusted when I listen to them.  I do not say that they oughtnot to accept it, and make much of it, when God givesit--because, when He gives it, His Majesty sees it to benecessary for them--but I do say that they ought not to growweary when they have it not.  They should then understand thatthey have no need of it, and be masters of themselves, when HisMajesty does not give it.  Let them be convinced of this, thereis a fault here; I have had experience of it, and know it to beso.  Let them believe it as an imperfection: they are notadvancing in liberty of spirit, but shrinking like cowards fromthe assault.22. It is not so much to beginners that I say this--though I doinsist upon it, because it is of great importance to them thatthey should begin with this liberty and resolution--as to others,of whom there are many, who make a beginning, but never come tothe end; and that is owing, I believe, in great measure, to theirnot having embraced the Cross from the first.  They aredistressed, thinking they are doing nothing; the understandingceases from its acts, and they cannot bear it.  Yet, perhaps, atthat very time, the will is feeding and gathering strength, andthey know it not.23. We must suppose that our Lord does not regard these things;for though they seem to us to be faults, yet they are not.His Majesty knoweth our misery and natural vileness better thanwe do ourselves.  He knoweth that these souls long to be alwaysthinking of Him and loving Him.  It is this resolution that Heseeks in us; the other anxieties which we inflict upon ourselvesserve to no other end but to disquiet the soul--which, if it beunable to derive any profit in one hour, will by them be disabledfor four.  This comes most frequently from bodilyindisposition--I have had very great experience in the matter,and I know it is true; for I have carefully observed it anddiscussed it afterwards with spiritual persons--for we are sowretched, that this poor prisoner of a soul shares in themiseries of the body. The changes of the seasons, and thealterations of the humours, very often compel it, without faultof its own, not to do what it would, but rather to suffer inevery way.  Meanwhile, the more we force the soul on theseoccasions, the greater the mischief, and the longer it lasts.Some discretion must be used, in order to ascertain whetherill-health be the occasion or not.  The poor soul must not bestifled.  Let those who thus suffer understand that they are ill;a change should be made in the hour of prayer, and oftentimesthat change should be continued for some days. Let souls pass outof this desert as they can, for it is very often the misery ofone that loves God to see itself living in such wretchedness,unable to do what it would, because it has to keep so evil aguest as the body.24. I spoke of discretion, because sometimes the devil will dothe same work; and so it is not always right to omit prayer whenthe understanding is greatly distracted and disturbed, nor totorment the soul to the doing of that which is out of its power.There are other things then to be done--exterior works, as ofcharity and spiritual reading--though at times the soul will notbe able to do them.  Take care, then, of the body, for the loveof God, because at many other times the body must serve the soul;and let recourse be had to some recreations--holy ones--such asconversation, or going out into the fields, as the confessorshall advise.  Altogether, experience is a great matter, and itmakes us understand what is convenient for us. Let God be servedin all things--His yoke is sweet; [7] and it is of greatimportance that the soul should not be dragged, as they say, butcarried gently, that it may make greater progress.25. So, then, I come back to what I advised before [8]--andthough I repeat it often, it matters not; it is of greatimportance that no one should distress himself on account ofaridities, or because his thoughts are restless and distracted;neither should he be afflicted thereat, if he would attain toliberty of spirit, and not be always in trouble.  Let him beginby not being afraid of the Cross, and he will see how our Lordwill help him to carry it, how joyfully he will advance, and whatprofit he will derive from it all.  It is now clear, if there isno water in the well, that we at least can put none into it.It is true we must not be careless about drawing it when there isany in it, because at that time it is the will of God to multiplyour virtues by means thereof.NOTES1.

ISFJ	 XII.What We Can Ourselves Do.  The Evil of Desiring to Attain toSupernatural States Before Our Lord Calls Us.1. My aim in the foregoing chapter--though I digressed to manyother matters, because they seemed to me very necessary--was toexplain how much we may attain to of ourselves; and how, in thesebeginnings of devotion, we are able in some degree to helpourselves: because thinking of, and pondering on, the sufferingsof our Lord for our sakes moves us to compassion, and the sorrowand tears which result therefrom are sweet.  The thought of theblessedness we hope for, of the love our Lord bore us, and of Hisresurrection, kindle within us a joy which is neither whollyspiritual nor wholly sensual; but the joy is virtuous, and thesorrow is most meritorious.2. Of this kind are all those things which produce a devotionacquired in part by means of the understanding, though it canneither be merited nor had, if God grants it not.  It is best fora soul which God has not raised to a higher state than this notto try to rise of itself.  Let this be well considered, becauseall the soul will gain in that way will be a loss.  In this stateit can make many acts of good resolutions to do much for God, andenkindle its love; other acts also, which may help the growth ofvirtues, according to that which is written in a book called TheArt of Serving God, [1] a most excellent work, and profitable forthose who are in this state, because the understanding isactive now.3. The soul may also place itself in the presence of Christ, andaccustom itself to many acts of love directed to His sacredHumanity, and remain in His presence continually, and speak toHim, pray to Him in its necessities, and complain to Him of itstroubles; be merry with Him in its joys, and yet not forget Himbecause of its joys.  All this it may do without set prayers, butrather with words befitting its desires and its needs.4. This is an excellent way whereby to advance, and that veryquickly.  He that will strive to have this preciouscompanionship, and will make much of it, and will sincerely loveour Lord, to whom we owe so much, is one, in my opinion, who hasmade some progress.  There is therefore no reason why we shouldtrouble ourselves because we have no sensible devotion, as I saidbefore. [2]  But let us rather give thanks to our Lord, whoallows us to have a desire to please Him, though our works bepoor. This practice of the presence of Christ is profitable inall states of prayer, and is a most safe way of advancing in thefirst state, and of attaining quickly to the second; and as forthe last states, it secures us against those risks which thedevil may occasion.5. This, then, is what we can do.  He who would pass out of thisstate, and upraise his spirit, in order to taste consolationsdenied him, will, in my opinion, lose both the one and theother. [3]  These consolations being supernatural, and theunderstanding inactive, the soul is then left desolate and ingreat aridity.  As the foundation of the whole building ishumility, the nearer we draw unto God the more this virtue shouldgrow; if it does not, everything is lost.  It seems to be a kindof pride when we seek to ascend higher, seeing that God descendsso low, when He allows us, being what we are, to draw nearunto Him.6. It must not be supposed that I am now speaking of raising ourthoughts to the consideration of the high things of heaven and ofits glory, or unto God and His great wisdom.  I never did thismyself, because I had not the capacity for it--as I saidbefore; [4] and I was so worthless, that, as to thinking even ofthe things of earth, God gave me grace to understand this truth:that in me it was no slight boldness to do so.  How much more,then, the thinking of heavenly things?  Others, however, willprofit in that way, particularly those who are learned; forlearning, in my opinion, is a great treasury in the matter ofthis exercise, if it be accompanied with humility.  I observedthis a few days ago in some learned men who had shortly beforemade a beginning, and had made great progress.  This is thereason why I am so very anxious that many learned men may becomespiritual. I shall speak of this by and by. [5]7. What I am saying--namely, let them not rise if God does notraise them--is the language of spirituality.  He will understandme who has had any experience; and I know not how to explain it,if what I have said does not make it plain.8. In mystical theology--of which I spoke before [6]--theunderstanding ceases from its acts, because God suspends it--as Ishall explain by and by, if I can; [7] and God give me the graceto do so.  We must neither imagine nor think that we can ofourselves bring about this suspension.  That is what I say mustnot be done; nor must we allow the understanding to cease fromits acts; for in that case we shall be stupid and cold, and theresult will be neither the one nor the other.  For when our Lordsuspends the understanding, and makes it cease from its acts, Heputs before it that which astonishes and occupies it: so thatwithout making any reflections, it shall comprehend in amoment [8] more than we could comprehend in many years with allthe efforts in the world.9. To have the powers of the mind occupied, and to think that youcan keep them at the same time quiet, is folly.  I repeat it,though it be not so understood, there is no great humility inthis; and, if it be blameless, it is not left unpunished--it islabour thrown away, and the soul is a little disgusted: it feelslike a man about to take a leap, and is held back.  Such a oneseems to have used up his strength already, and finds himselfunable to do that which he wished to have done: so here, in thescanty gain that remains, he who will consider the matter willtrace that slight want of humility of which I have spoken; [9]for that virtue has this excellence: there is no good workattended by humility that leaves the soul disgusted.  It seems tome that I have made this clear enough; yet, after all, perhapsonly for myself.  May our Lord open their eyes who read this, bygiving them experience; and then however slight that experiencemay be, they will immediately understand it.10. For many years I read much, and understood nothing; and for along time, too, though God gave me understanding herein, I nevercould utter a word by which I might explain it to others.This was no little trouble to me.  When His Majesty pleases, Heteaches everything in a moment, so that I am lost in wonder.One thing I can truly say: though I conversed with many spiritualpersons, who sought to make me understand what our Lord wasgiving me, in order that I might be able to speak of it, the factis, that my dulness was so great, that I derived no advantagewhatever, much or little, from their teaching.11. Or it may be, as His Majesty has always been my Master--mayHe be blessed for ever! for I am ashamed of myself that I can sayso with truth--that it was His good pleasure I should meet withno one to whom I should be indebted in this matter.  So, withoutmy wishing or asking it--I never was careful about this, for thatwould have been a virtue in me, but only about vanity--God gaveme to understand with all distinctness in a moment, and alsoenabled me to express myself, so that my confessors wereastonished but I more than they, because I knew my own dulnessbetter.  It is not long since this happened.  And so that whichour Lord has not taught me, I seek not to know it, unless it be amatter that touches my conscience.12. Again I repeat my advice: it is of great moment not to raiseour spirit ourselves, if our Lord does not raise it for us; andif He does, there can be no mistaking it.  For women, it isspecially wrong, because the devil can delude them--though I amcertain our Lord will never allow him to hurt any one who laboursto draw near unto God in humility.  On the contrary, such a onewill derive more profit and advantage out of that attack by whichSatan intended to hurt him.13. I have dwelt so long upon this matter because this way ofprayer is the most common with beginners, and because the adviceI have given is very important.  It will be found much bettergiven elsewhere: that I admit; and I admit, also, that in writingit I am ashamed of myself, and covered with confusion--though notso much so as I ought to be.  Blessed for ever be our Lord, ofwhose will and pleasure it is that I am allowed, being what I am,to speak of things which are His, of such a nature, and so deep.1.

ISFJ	 XIII.Of Certain Temptations of Satan.  Instructions Relating Thereto.1. I have thought it right to speak of certain temptations I haveobserved to which beginners are liable--some of them I have hadmyself--and to give some advice about certain things which to meseem necessary.  In the beginning, then, we should strive to becheerful and unconstrained; for there are people who think it isall over with devotion if they relax themselves ever so little.It is right to be afraid of self; so that, having no confidencein ourselves, much or little, we may not place ourselves in thosecircumstances wherein men usually sin against God; for it is amost necessary fear, till we become very perfect in virtue.And there are not many who are so perfect as to be able to relaxthemselves on those occasions which offer temptations to theirnatural temper; for always while we live, were it only topreserve humility, it is well we should know our own miserablenature; but there are many occasions on which it is permittedus--as I said just now [1]--to take some recreation, in orderthat we may with more vigour resume our prayer.2. Discretion is necessary throughout.  We must have greatconfidence; because it is very necessary for us not to contractour desires, but put our trust in God; for, if we do violence toourselves by little and little, we shall, though not at once,reach that height which many Saints by His grace have reached.If they had never resolved to desire, and had never by little andlittle acted upon that resolve, they never could have ascended toso high a state.3. His Majesty seeks and loves courageous souls; but they must behumble in their ways, and have no confidence in themselves.I never saw one of those lag behind on the road; and never acowardly soul, though aided by humility, make that progress inmany years which the former makes in a few.  I am astonished atthe great things done on this road by encouraging oneself toundertake great things, though we may not have the strength forthem at once; the soul takes a flight upwards and ascends high,though, like a little bird whose wings are weak, it grows wearyand rests.4. At one time I used often to think of those words of St. Paul:'That all things are possible in God.' [2]  I saw clearly that ofmyself I could do nothing.  This was of great service to me.So also was the saying of St. Augustine: 'Give me, O Lord, whatThou commandest, and command what Thou wilt.' [3]  I was oftenthinking how St. Peter lost nothing by throwing himself into thesea, though he was afterwards afraid. [4]  These firstresolutions are a great matter--although it is necessary in thebeginning that we should be very reserved, controlled by thediscretion and authority of a director; but we must take carethat he be one who does not teach us to crawl like toads, nor onewho may be satisfied when the soul shows itself fit only to catchlizards.  Humility must always go before: so that we may knowthat this strength can come out of no strength of our own.5. But it is necessary we should understand what manner ofhumility this should be, because Satan, I believe, does greatharm; for he hinders those who begin to pray from going onwards,by suggesting to them false notions of humility.  He makes themthink it is pride to have large desires, to wish to imitate theSaints, and to long for martyrdom.  He tells us forthwith, or hemakes us think, that the actions of the Saints are to be admired,not to be imitated, by us who are sinners.  I, too, say the samething; but we must see what those actions are which we are toadmire, and what those are which we are to imitate; for it wouldbe wrong in a person who is weak and sickly to undertake muchfasting and sharp penances to retire into the desert, where hecould not sleep, nor find anything to eat; or, indeed, toundertake any austerities of this kind.6. But we ought to think that we can force ourselves, by thegrace of God, to hold the world in profound contempt--to makelight of honour, and be detached from our possessions.Our hearts, however, are so mean that we think the earth wouldfail us under our feet, if we were to cease to care even for amoment for the body, and give ourselves up to spirituality.Then we think that to have all we require contributes torecollection, because anxieties disturb prayer.  It is painful tome that our confidence in God is so scanty, and our self-love sostrong, as that any anxiety about our own necessities shoulddisturb us. But so it is; for when our spiritual progress is soslight, a mere nothing will give us as much trouble as great andimportant matters will give to others.  And we thinkourselves spiritual!7. Now, to me, this way of going on seems to betray a dispositionto reconcile soul and body together, in order that we may notmiss our ease in this world, and yet have the fruition of God inthe next; and so it will be if we walk according to justice,clinging to virtue; but it is the pace of a hen--it will neverbring us to liberty of spirit.  It is a course of proceeding, asit seems to me, most excellent for those who are in the marriedstate, and who must live according to their vocation; but for theother state, I by no means wish for such a method of progress,neither can I be made to believe it to be sound; for I have triedit, and I should have remained in that way, if our Lord in Hisgoodness had not taught me another and a shorter road.8. Though, in the matter of desires, I always had generous ones;but I laboured, as I said before, [5] to make my prayer, and, atthe same time, to live at my ease.  If there had been any one torouse me to a higher flight, he might have brought me, so Ithink, to a state in which these desires might have had theireffects; but, for our sins, so few and so rare are they whosediscretion in that matter is not excessive.  That, I believe, isreason enough why those who begin do not attain more quickly togreat perfection; for our Lord never fails us, and it is not Hisfault; the fault and the wretchedness of this being all our own.9. We may also imitate the Saints by striving after solitude andsilence, and many other virtues that will not kill these wretchedbodies of ours, which insist on being treated so orderly, thatthey may disorder the soul; and Satan, too, helps much to makethem unmanageable.  When he sees us a little anxious about them,he wants nothing more to convince us that our way of life mustkill us, and destroy our health; even if we weep, he makes usafraid of blindness.  I have passed through this, and therefore Iknow it; but I know of no better sight or better health that wecan desire, than the loss of both in such a cause. Being myselfso sickly, I was always under constraint, and good for nothing,till I resolved to make no account of my body nor of my health;even now I am worthless enough.10. But when it pleased God to let me find out this device ofSatan, I used to say to the latter, when he suggested to me thatI was ruining my health, that my death was of no consequence;when he suggested rest, I replied that I did not want rest, butthe Cross.  His other suggestions I treated in the same way.I saw clearly that in most things, though I was really verysickly, it was either a temptation of Satan, or a weakness on mypart. My health has been much better since I have ceased to lookafter my ease and comforts.  It is of great importance not to letour own thoughts frighten us in the beginning, when we setourselves to pray.  Believe me in this, for I know it byexperience.  As a warning to others, it may be that this story ofmy failures may be useful.11. There is another temptation, which is very common: whenpeople begin to have pleasure in the rest and the fruit ofprayer, they will have everybody else be very spiritual also.Now, to desire this is not wrong, but to try to bring it aboutmay not be right, except with great discretion and with muchreserve, without any appearance of teaching.  He who would do anygood in this matter ought to be endowed with solid virtues, thathe may not put temptation in the way of others.  It happened tome--that is how I know it--when, as I said before, [6] I madeothers apply themselves to prayer, to be a source of temptationand disorder; for, on the one hand, they heard me say greatthings of the blessedness of prayer, and, on the other, saw howpoor I was in virtue, notwithstanding my prayer.  They had goodreasons on their side, and afterwards they told me of it; forthey knew not how these things could be compatible one with theother.  This it was that made them not to regard that as evilwhich was really so in itself, namely, that they saw me do itmyself, now and then, during the time that they thought well ofme in some measure.12. This is Satan's work: he seems to take advantage of thevirtues we may have, for the purpose of giving a sanction, so faras he can, to the evil he aims at; how slight soever that evilmay be, his gain must be great, if it prevail in a religioushouse.  How much, then, must his gain have been, when the evil Idid was so very great!  And thus, during many years, only threepersons were the better for what I said to them; but now that ourLord has made me stronger in virtue, in the course of two orthree years many persons have profited, as I shallshow hereafter. [7]13. There is another great inconvenience in addition to this: theloss to our own soul; for the utmost we have to do in thebeginning is to take care of our own soul only, and consider thatin the whole world there is only God and our soul.  This is apoint of great importance.14. There is another temptation--we ought to be aware of it, andbe cautious in our conduct: persons are carried away by a zealfor virtue, through the pain which the sight of the sins andfailings of others occasions them.  Satan tells them that thispain arises only out of their desire that God may not beoffended, and out of their anxiety about His honour; so theyimmediately seek to remedy the evil.  This so disturbs them, thatthey cannot pray.  The greatest evil of all is their thinkingthis an act of virtue, of perfection, and of a great zeal forGod.  I am not speaking of the pain which public sins occasion,if they be habitual in any community, nor of wrongs done to theChurch, nor of heresies by which so many souls are visibly lost;for this pain is most wholesome, and being wholesome is no sourceof disquiet.  The security, therefore, of that soul which wouldapply itself to prayer lies in casting away from itself allanxiety about persons and things, in taking care of itself, andin pleasing God.  This is the most profitable course.15. If I were to speak of the mistakes which I have seen peoplemake, in reliance on their own good intentions, I should nevercome to an end.  Let us labour, therefore, always to consider thevirtues and the good qualities which we discern in others, andwith our own great sins cover our eyes, so that we may see noneof their failings.  This is one way of doing our work; and thoughwe may not be perfect in it at once, we shall acquire one greatvirtue--we shall look upon all men as better than ourselves; andwe begin to acquire that virtue in this way, by the grace of God,which is necessary in all things--for when we have it not, allour endeavours are in vain--and by imploring Him to give us thisvirtue; for He never fails us, if we do what we can.16. This advice, also, they must take into their considerationwho make much use of their understanding, eliciting from onesubject many thoughts and conceptions.  As to those who, likemyself, cannot do it, I have no advice to give, except that theyare to have patience, until our Lord shall send them both matterand light; for they can do so little of themselves, that theirunderstanding is a hindrance to them rather than a help.17. To those, then, who can make use of their understanding, Isay that they are not to spend the whole time in that way; forthough it be most meritorious, yet they must not, when prayer issweet, suppose that there never will be a Sunday or a time whenno work ought to be done.  They think it lost time to dootherwise; but I think that loss their greatest gain.  Let themrather, as I have said, [8] place themselves in the presence ofChrist, and, without fatiguing the understanding, converse withHim, and in Him rejoice, without wearying themselves in searchingout reasons; but let them rather lay their necessities beforeHim, and the just reasons there are why He should not suffer usin His presence: at one time this, at another time that, lest thesoul should be wearied by always eating of the same food.  Thesemeats are most savoury and wholesome, if the palate be accustomedto them; they will furnish a great support for the life of thesoul, and they have many other advantages also.18. I will explain myself further; for the doctrine of prayer isdifficult, and, without a director, very hard to understand.Though I would willingly be concise, and though a mere hint isenough for his clear intellect who has commanded me to write onthe subject of prayer, yet so it is, my dulness does not allow meto say or explain in a few words that which it is so important toexplain well.  I, who have gone through so much, am sorry forthose who begin only with books; for there is a strangedifference between that which we learn by reading, and that whichwe learn by experience.19. Going back, then, to what I was saying.  We set ourselves tomeditate upon some mystery of the Passion: let us say, our Lordat the pillar.  The understanding goeth about seeking for thesources out of which came the great dolours and the bitteranguish which His Majesty endured in that desolation.It considers that mystery in many lights, which the intellect, ifit be skilled in its work, or furnished with learning, may thereobtain.  This is a method of prayer which should be to everyonethe beginning, the middle, and the end: a most excellent and safeway, until our Lord shall guide them to other supernatural ways.20. I say to all, because there are many souls who make greaterprogress by meditation on other subjects than on the SacredPassion; for as there are many mansions in heaven, so there arealso many roads leading thither.  Some persons advance byconsidering themselves in hell, others in heaven--and these aredistressed by meditations on hell.  Others meditate on death;some persons, if tender-hearted, are greatly fatigued bycontinual meditations on the Passion; but are consoled and makeprogress when they meditate on the power and greatness of God inHis creatures, and on His love visible in all things.  This is anadmirable method--not omitting, however, from time to time, thePassion and Life of Christ, the Source of all good that evercame, and that ever shall come.21. He who begins is in need of instruction, whereby he mayascertain what profits him most.  For this end it is verynecessary he should have a director, who ought to be a person ofexperience; for if he be not, he will make many mistakes, anddirect a soul without understanding its ways, or suffering it tounderstand them itself; for such a soul, knowing that obedienceto a director is highly meritorious, dares not transgress thecommandments it receives.  I have met with souls cramped andtormented, because he who directed them had no experience: thatmade me sorry for them.  Some of them knew not what to do withthemselves; for directors who do not understand the spirit oftheir penitents afflict them soul and body, and hindertheir progress. [9]22. One person I had to do with had been kept by her director foreight years, as it were, in prison; he would not allow her toquit the subject of self-knowledge; and yet our Lord had alreadyraised her to the prayer of quiet; so she had much to suffer.23. Although this matter of self-knowledge must never be putaside--for there is no soul so great a giant on this road but hasfrequent need to turn back, and be again an infant at the breast;and this must never be forgotten.  I shall repeat it, [10]perhaps, many times, because of its great importance--for amongall the states of prayer, however high they may be, there is notone in which it is not often necessary to go back to thebeginning.  The knowledge of our sins, and of our own selves, isthe bread which we have to eat with all the meats, howeverdelicate they may be, in the way of prayer; without this bread,life cannot be sustained, though it must be taken by measure.When a soul beholds itself resigned, and clearly understands thatthere is no goodness in it--when it feels itself abashed in thepresence of so great a King, and sees how little it pays of thegreat debt it owes Him--why should it be necessary for it towaste its time on this subject?  Why should it not rather proceedto other matters which our Lord places before it, and forneglecting which there is no reason?  His Majesty surely knowsbetter than we do what kind of food is proper for us.24. So, then, it is of great consequence that the director shouldbe prudent--I mean, of sound understanding--and a man ofexperience.  If, in addition to this, he is a learned man, it isa very great matter.  But if these three qualities cannot be hadtogether, the first two are the most important, because learnedmen may be found with whom we can communicate when it isnecessary.  I mean, that for beginners learned men are of littleuse, if they are not men of prayer.  I do not say that they areto have nothing to do with learned men, because a spirituality,the foundations of which are not resting on the truth, I wouldrather were not accompanied with prayer.  Learning is a greatthing, for it teaches us who know so little, and enlightens us;so when we have come to the knowledge of the truths contained inthe holy writings, we do what we ought to do.  From sillydevotions, God deliver us!25. I will explain myself further, for I am meddling, I believe,with too many matters.  It has always been my failing that Icould never make myself understood--as I said before [11]--but atthe cost of many words.  A nun begins to practise prayer; if herdirector be silly, and if he should take it into his head, hewill make her feel that it is better for her to obey him than herown superior.  He will do all this without any evil purpose,thinking that he is doing right.  For if he be not a religioushimself, he will think this right enough.  If his penitent be amarried woman, he will tell her that it is better for her to giveherself unto prayer, when she ought to attend to her house,although she may thereby displease her husband.  And so it is, heknows not how to make arrangements for time and business, so thateverything may be done as it ought to be done; he has no lighthimself, and can therefore give none to others, however much hemay wish to do so.26. Though learning does not seem necessary for discretion, myopinion has always been, and will be, that every Christian shouldcontinue to be guided by a learned director if he can, and themore learned the better.  They who walk in the way of prayer havethe greater need of learning; and the more spiritual they are thegreater is that need.  Let them not say that learned men notgiven to prayer are not fit counsellors for those who pray: thatis a delusion.  I have conversed with many; and now for someyears I have sought them the more, because of my greater need ofthem.  I have always been fond of them; for though some of themhave no experience, they do not dislike spirituality, neither arethey ignorant of what it is, because in the sacred writings withwhich they are familiar they always find the truth aboutspirituality.  I am certain myself that a person given to prayer,who treats of these matters with learned men, unless he isdeceived with his own consent, will never be carried away by anyillusions of the devil.  I believe that the evil spirits areexceedingly afraid of learned men who are humble and virtuous,knowing that they will be found out and defeated by them.27. I have said this because there are opinions held to theeffect that learned men, if they are not spiritual, are notsuited for persons given to prayer.  I have just said that aspiritual director is necessary; but if he be not a learned man,he is a great hindrance.  It will help us much if we consultthose who are learned, provided they be virtuous; even if they benot spiritual, they will be of service to me, and God will enablethem to understand what they should teach; He will even make themspiritual, in order that they may help us on.  I do not say thiswithout having had experience of it; and I have met with morethan two.28. I say, then, that a person who shall resign his soul to bewholly subject to one director will make a great mistake, if heis in religion, unless he finds a director of this kind, becauseof the obedience due to his own superior.  His director may bedeficient in the three requisites I speak of, [12] and that willbe no slight cross, without voluntarily subjecting theunderstanding to one whose understanding is none of the best.At least, I have never been able to bring myself to do it,neither does it seem to me to be right.29. But if he be a person living in the world, let him praise Godfor the power he has of choosing whom he will obey, and let himnot lose so excellent a liberty; yea, rather let him be without adirector till he finds him--for our Lord will give him one, if heis really humble, and has a desire to meet with the right person.I praise God greatly--we women, and those who are unlearned,ought always to render Him unceasing thanks--because there arepersons who, by labours so great, have attained to the truth, ofwhich we unlearned people are ignorant. I often wonder at learnedmen--particularly those who are in religion--when I think of thetrouble they have had in acquiring that which they communicate tome for my good, and that without any more trouble to me than theasking for it.  And yet there are people who will not takeadvantage of their learning: God grant it may not be so!30. I see them undergo the poverty of the religious life, whichis great, together with its penances, its meagre food, the yokeof obedience, which makes me ashamed of myself at times; and withall this, interrupted sleep, trials everywhere, everywhere theCross.  I think it would be a great evil for any one to lose sogreat a good by his own fault.  It may be some of us, who areexempted from these burdens--who have our food put into ourmouths, as they say, and live at our ease--may think, because wegive ourselves a little more to prayer, that we are raised abovethe necessity of such great hardships.  Blessed be Thou, O Lord,who hast made me so incapable and so useless; but I bless Theestill more for this--that Thou quickenest so many to quicken us.Our prayer must therefore be very earnest for those who give uslight.  What should we be without them in the midst of theseviolent storms which now disturb the Church?  If some havefallen, the good will shine more and more. [13]  May it pleaseour Lord to hold them in His hand, and help them, that they mayhelp us.31. I have gone far away from the subject I began to speak of;but all is to the purpose for those who are beginners, that theymay begin a journey which is so high in such a way as that theyshall go on by the right road.  Coming back, then, to what Ispoke of before, [14] the meditation on Christ bound to thepillar, it is well we should make reflections for a time, andconsider the sufferings He there endured, for whom He enduredthem, who He is who endured them, and the love with which He borethem.  But a person should not always fatigue himself in makingthese reflections, but rather let him remain there with Christ,in the silence of the understanding.32. If he is able, let him employ himself in looking upon Christ,who is looking upon him; let him accompany Him, and make hispetitions to Him; let him humble himself, and delight himself inChrist, and keep in mind that he never deserved to be there.When he shall be able to do this, though it may be in thebeginning of his prayer, he will find great advantage; and thisway of prayer brings great advantages with it--at least, so mysoul has found it.  I do not know whether I am describing itaright; you, my father, will see to it.  May our Lord grant me toplease Him rightly for ever!  Amen.1. Ch. xi. § 24.2. Philipp. iv. 13; 'Omnia possum in Eo.'3.

ISFJ	 XIV.The Second State of Prayer.  Its Supernatural Character.1. Having spoken of the toilsome efforts and of the strengthrequired for watering the garden when we have to draw the waterout of the well, let us now speak of the second manner of drawingthe water, which the Lord of the vineyard has ordained; of themachine of wheel and buckets whereby the gardener may draw morewater with less labour, and be able to take some rest withoutbeing continually at work.  This, then, is what I am now going todescribe; and I apply it to the prayer called the prayerof quiet.2. Herein the soul begins to be recollected; it is now touchingon the supernatural--for it never could by any efforts of its ownattain to this.  True, it seems at times to have been wearied atthe wheel, labouring with the understanding, and filling thebuckets; but in this second degree the water is higher, andaccordingly the labour is much less than it was when the waterhad to be drawn up out of the well; I mean, that the water isnearer to it, for grace reveals itself more distinctly tothe soul.3. This is a gathering together of the faculties of the soulwithin itself, in order that it may have the fruition of thatcontentment in greater sweetness; but the faculties are not lost,neither are they asleep: the will alone is occupied in such a waythat, without knowing how it has become a captive, it gives asimple consent to become the prisoner of God; for it knows wellwhat is to be the captive of Him it loves.  O my Jesus and myLord, how pressing now is Thy love! [1]  It binds our love inbonds so straitly, that it is not in its power at this moment tolove anything else but Thee.4. The other two faculties help the will, that it may renderitself capable of the fruition of so great a good; nevertheless,it occasionally happens, even when the will is in union, thatthey hinder it very much: but then it should never heed them atall, simply abiding in its fruition and quiet. [2]  For if ittried to make them recollected, it would miss its way togetherwith them, because they are at this time like doves which are notsatisfied with the food the master of the dovecot gives themwithout any labouring for it on their part, and which go forth inquest of it elsewhere, and so hardly find it that they come back.And so the memory and the understanding come and go, seekingwhether the will is going to give them that into the fruition ofwhich it has entered itself.5. If it be our Lord's pleasure to throw them any food, theystop; if not, they go again to seek it.  They must be thinkingthat they are of some service to the will; and now and then thememory or the imagination, seeking to represent to it that ofwhich it has the fruition, does it harm.  The will, therefore,should be careful to deal with them as I shall explain.Everything that takes place now in this state brings the verygreatest consolation; and the labour is so slight, that prayer,even if persevered in for some time, is never wearisome.The reason is, that the understanding is now working very gently,and is drawing very much more water than it drew out of the well.The tears, which God now sends, flow with joy; though we feelthem, they are not the result of any efforts of our own.6. This water of grand blessings and graces, which our Lord nowsupplies, makes the virtues thrive much more, beyond allcomparison, than they did in the previous state of prayer; forthe soul is already ascending out of its wretched state, and somelittle knowledge of the blissfulness of glory is communicated toit.  This, I believe, is it that makes the virtues grow the more,and also to draw nearer to essential virtue, God Himself, fromWhom all virtues proceed; for His Majesty has begun tocommunicate Himself to this soul, and will have it feel how He iscommunicating Himself.7. As soon as the soul has arrived thus far, it begins to losethe desire of earthly things, [3] and no wonder; for it seesclearly that, even for a moment, this joy is not to be had onearth; that there are no riches, no dominion, no honours, nodelights, that can for one instant, even for the twinkling of aneye, minister such a joy; for it is a true satisfaction, and thesoul sees that it really does satisfy.  Now, we who are on earth,as it seems to me, scarcely ever understand wherein oursatisfaction lies, for it is always liable to disappointment; butin this, at that time, there is none: the disappointment comethafterwards, when the soul sees that all is over, and that it hasno power to recover it, neither does it know how; for if it cutitself in pieces by penance and prayer, and every other kind ofausterities, all would be of little use, if our Lord did notgrant it.  God, in His great mercy, will have the soul comprehendthat His Majesty is so near to it, that it need not sendmessengers to Him, but may speak to Him itself, and not with aloud crying, because so near is He already, that He understandseven the movements of its lips.8. It seems absurd to say this, seeing that we know that Godunderstands us always, and is present with us.  It is so, andthere can be no doubt of it; but our Emperor and Lord will haveus now understand that He understands us; and also have usunderstand what His presence bringeth about, and that He means ina special way to begin a work in the soul, which is manifested inthe great joy, inward and outward, which He communicates, and inthe difference there is, as I said just now, between this joy anddelight and all the joys of earth; for He seems to be filling upthe void in our souls occasioned by our sins.9. This satisfaction lies in the innermost part of the soul, andthe soul knows not whence, nor how, it came, very often it knowsnot what to do, or wish, or pray for.  It seems to find all thisat once, and knoweth not what it hath found; nor do I know how toexplain it, because learning is necessary for many things.  Here,indeed, learning would be very much to the purpose, in order toexplain the general and particular helps of grace; for there aremany who know nothing about them.  Learning would serve to showhow our Lord now will have the soul to see, as it were, with thenaked eye, as men speak, this particular help of grace, and bealso useful in many other ways wherein I am likely to go astray.But as what I write is to be seen by those who have the learningto discover whether I make mistakes or not, I go on withoutanxiety; for I know I need have none whatever about either theletter or the spirit, because it is in their power to whom it isto be sent to do with it as they will: they will understand it,and blot out whatever may be amiss.10. I should like them to explain this, because it is a principalpoint, and because a soul, when our Lord begins to bestow thesegraces upon it, does not understand them, and does not know whatto do with itself; for if God leads it by the way of fear, as Heled me, its trial will be heavy, if there be no one whounderstands the state it is in; and to see itself as in a pictureis a great comfort; and then it sees clearly that it istravelling on that road.  The knowledge of what it has to do is agreat blessing for it, so that it may advance forwards in everyone of these degrees of prayer; for I have suffered greatly, andlost much time, because I did not know what to do; and I am verysorry for those souls who find themselves alone when they come tothis state; for though I read many spiritual books, wherein thisvery matter is discussed, they threw very little light upon it.And if it be not a soul much exercised in prayer, it will find itenough to understand its state, be the books ever so clear.11. I wish much that our Lord would help me to describe theeffects on the soul of these things, now that they begin to besupernatural, so that men might know by these effects whetherthey come from the Spirit of God.  I mean, known as things areknown here below--though it is always well to live in fear, andon our guard; for even if they do come from God, now and then thedevil will be able to transform himself into an angel oflight; [4] and the soul, if not experienced herein, will notunderstand the matter; and it must have so much experience forthe understanding thereof, that it is necessary it should haveattained to the highest perfection of prayer.12. The little time I have helps me but little, and it istherefore necessary His Majesty should undertake it Himself; forI have to live in community, and have very many things to employme, as I am in a house which is newly founded--as will appearhereafter; [5] and so I am writing, with very many interruptions,by little and little at a time.  I wish I had leisure; for whenour Lord gives the spirit, it is more easily and better done; itis then as with a person working embroidery with the patternbefore her; but if the spirit be wanting, there is no moremeaning in the words than in gibberish, so to speak, though manyyears may have been spent in prayer.  And thus I think it a verygreat advantage to be in this state of prayer when I am writingthis; for I see clearly that it is not I who speak, nor is it Iwho with her understanding has arranged it; and afterwards I donot know how I came to speak so accurately. [6]  It has oftenhappened to me thus.13. Let us now return to our orchard, or flower-garden, andbehold now how the trees begin to fill with sap for the bringingforth of the blossoms, and then of the fruit--the flowers and theplants, also, their fragrance.  This illustration pleases me; forvery often, when I was beginning--and our Lord grant that I havereally begun to serve His Majesty--I mean, begun in relation towhat I have to say of my life,--it was to me a great joy toconsider my soul as a garden, and our Lord as walking in it.I used to beseech Him to increase the fragrance of the littleflowers of virtues--which were beginning, as it seemed tobud--and preserve them, that they might be to His glory; for Idesired nothing for myself.  I prayed Him to cut those He liked,because I already knew that they would grow the better.14. I say cut; for there are times in which the soul has norecollection of this garden--everything seems parched, and thereis no water to be had for preserving it--and in which it seems asif the soul had never possessed any virtue at all.  This is theseason of heavy trials; for our Lord will have the poor gardenersuppose all the trouble he took in maintaining and watering thegarden to have been taken to no purpose.  Then is the time reallyfor weeding and rooting out every plant, however small it may be,that is worthless, in the knowledge that no efforts of ours aresufficient, if God withholds from us the waters of His grace; andin despising ourselves as being nothing, and even less thannothing.  In this way we gain great humility--the flowersgrow afresh.15. O my Lord and my Good!  I cannot utter these words withouttears, and rejoicing in my soul; for Thou wilt be thus with us,and art with us, in the Sacrament.  We may believe so most truly;for so it is, and the comparison I make is a great truth; and, ifour sins stand not in the way, we may rejoice in Thee, becauseThou rejoicest in us; for Thou hast told us that Thy delight isto be with the children of men. [7]  O my Lord, what does itmean?  Whenever I hear these words, they always give me greatconsolation, and did so even when I was most wicked.16. Is it possible, 0 Lord, that there can be a soul which, afterattaining to this state wherein Thou bestowest upon it the likegraces and consolations, and wherein it understands that Thoudelightest to be with it, can yet fall back and offend Thee afterso many favours, and such great demonstrations of the love Thoubearest it, and of which there cannot be any doubt, because theeffect of it is so visible?  Such a soul there certainly is; forI have done so, not once, but often.  May it please Thy goodness,O Lord, that I may be alone in my ingratitude--the only one whohas committed so great an iniquity, and whose ingratitude hasbeen so immeasurable!  But even out of my ingratitude Thineinfinite goodness has brought forth some good; and the greater mywickedness, the greater the splendour of the great mercy of Thycompassions.  Oh, what reasons have I to magnify them for ever!17. May it be so, I beseech Thee, O my God, and may I sing ofthem for ever, now that Thou hast been pleased to show mercies sogreat unto me that they who see them are astonished, mercieswhich draw me out of myself continually, that I may praise Theemore and more! for, remaining in myself, without Thee, I could donothing, O my Lord, but be as the withered flowers of the garden;so that this miserable earth of mine becomes a heap of refuse, asit was before.  Let it not be so, O Lord!--let not a soul whichThou hast purchased with so many labours be lost, one which Thouhast so often ransomed anew, and delivered from between the teethof the hideous dragon!18. You, my father, must forgive me for wandering from thesubject; and, as I am speaking to the purpose I have in view, youmust not be surprised.  What I write is what my soul hasunderstood; and it is very often hard enough to abstain from thepraises of God when, in the course of writing, the great debt Iowe Him presents itself before me.  Nor do I think that it can bedisagreeable to you; because both of us, I believe, may sing thesame song, though in a different way; for my debt is much thegreater, seeing that God has forgiven me more, as you, myfather, know.1. 2 Cor. v. 14: 'Charitas enim Christi urget nos.'2. See ch. xvii. § 12; Way of Perfection, ch. liii., but xxxi. ofthe old editions.3. See Relation, i. § 12.4. 2 Cor. xi. 14: 'Ipse enim Satanas transfigurat se inangelum lucis.'5. See ch. x. § 11.  As that passage refers probably to themonastery of the Incarnation, this must refer to that ofSt. Joseph, newly founded in Avila; for that of the Incarnationwas founded a short time before the Saint was born; and she couldhardly say of it, now that she was at least in her forty-seventhyear, that it was newly founded.  The house, however, was poor;for she says, ch. xxxii. § 12, that the nuns occasionally quittedthe monastery for a time, because of its poverty.6. See ch. xviii. § 10.  In the second Report of the Rota,p. 477--quoted by Benedict XIV., De Canoniz. iii. 26, n. 12, andby the Bollandists in the Acta, 1315--we have these words, andthey throw great light on the text: 'Sunt et alli testes de visuaffirmantes quod quando beata Teresa scribebat libros, faciesejus resplendebat.'  In the information taken in Granada, theMother Anne of the Incarnation says she saw the Saint one night,while writing the Fortress of the Soul, with her face shining;and Mary of St. Francis deposes to the same effect in theinformations taken in Medina (De la Fuente,vol. ii. pp. 389, 392).7.

ISFJ	 XV.Instructions for Those Who Have Attained to the Prayer of Quiet.Many Advance So Far, but Few Go Farther.1. Let us now go back to the subject.  This quiet andrecollection of the soul makes itself in great measure felt inthe satisfaction and peace, attended with very great joy andrepose of the faculties, and most sweet delight, wherein the soulis established. [1]  It thinks, because it has not gone beyondit, that there is nothing further to wish for, but that its abodemight be there, and it would willingly say so with St. Peter. [2]It dares not move nor stir, because it thinks that this blessingit has received must then escape out of its hands; now and then,it could wish it did not even breathe. [3]  The poor little soulis not aware that, as of itself it could do nothing to draw downthis blessing on itself, it is still less able to retain it amoment longer than our Lord wills it should remain.2. I have already said that, in the prior recollection andquiet, [4] there is no failure of the powers of the soul; but thesoul is so satisfied in God that, although two of its powers bedistracted, yet, while the recollection lasts, as the will abidesin union with God, so its peace and quiet are not disturbed; onthe contrary, the will by degrees brings the understanding andthe memory back again; for though the will is not yet altogetherabsorbed, it continues still occupied without knowing how, sothat, notwithstanding all the efforts of the memory and theunderstanding, they cannot rob it of its delight andjoy [5]--yea, rather, it helps without any labour at all to keepthis little spark of the love of God from being quenched.3. Oh, that His Majesty would be gracious unto me, and enable meto give a clear account of the matter; for many are the souls whoattain to this state, and few are they who go farther: and I knownot who is in fault; most certainly it is not God; for when HisMajesty shows mercy unto a soul, so that it advances so far, Ibelieve that He will not fail to be more merciful still, if therebe no shortcomings on our part.4. And it is of great importance for the soul that has advancedso far as this to understand the great dignity of its state, thegreat grace given it by our Lord, and how in all reason it shouldnot belong to earth; because He, of His goodness, seems to makeit here a denizen of heaven, unless it be itself in fault.And miserable will that soul be if it turns back; it will godown, I think so, even to the abyss, as I was going myself, ifthe mercy of our Lord had not brought me back; because, for themost part, it must be the effect of grave faults--that is myopinion: nor is it possible to forsake so great a good otherwisethan through the blindness occasioned by much evil.5. Therefore, for the love of our Lord, I implore those souls towhom His Majesty has given so great a grace--the attainment ofthis state--to know and make much of themselves, with a humbleand holy presumption, in order that they may never return to theflesh-pots of Egypt.  And if through weakness and wickedness, anda mean and wretched nature, they should fall, as I did, let themalways keep in mind the good they have lost; let them suspect andfear--they have reason to do so--that, if they do not resumetheir prayer, they may go on from bad to worse.  I call that areal fall which makes us hate the way by which so great a goodwas obtained.  I address myself to those souls; but I am notsaying that they will never offend God, nor fall intosin,--though there are good reasons why those who have receivedthese graces should keep themselves carefully from sin; but weare miserable creatures.  What I earnestly advise is this: letthere be no giving up of prayer; it is by prayer they willunderstand what they are doing, and obtain from our Lord thegrace to repent, and strength to rise again; they must believeand believe again that, if they cease from praying, they run--soI think--into danger.  I know not if I understand what I amsaying; for, as I said before, I measure others by myself. [6]6. The prayer of quiet, then, is a little spark of the true loveof Himself, which our Lord begins to enkindle in the soul; andHis will is, that the soul should understand what this love is bythe joy it brings.  This quiet and recollection and little spark,if it is the work of the Spirit of God, and not a sweetnesssupplied by Satan, or brought about by ourselves, produces greatresults.  A person of experience, however, cannot possibly failto understand at once that it is not a thing that can beacquired, were it not that our nature is so greedy of sweetness,that it seeks for it in every way.  But it becomes cold verysoon; for, however much we try to make the fire burn, in order toobtain this sweetness, it does not appear that we do anythingelse but throw water on it, to put it out.  This spark, then,given of God, however slight it may be, causes a great crackling;and if men do not quench it by their faults, it is the beginningof the great fire, which sends forth--I shall speak of it in theproper place [7]--the flames of that most vehement love of Godwhich His Majesty will have perfect souls to possess.7. This little spark is a sign or pledge which God gives to asoul, in token of His having chosen it for great things, if itwill prepare to receive them.  It is a great gift, much too greatfor me to be able to speak of it.  It is a great sorrow to me;because, as I said before, [8] I know that many souls come thusfar, and that those who go farther, as they ought to go, are sofew, that I am ashamed to say it.  I do not mean that they areabsolutely few: there must be many, because God is patient withus, for some reasons; I speak of what I have seen.8. I should like much to recommend these souls to take care thatthey do not hide their talent; for it may be that God has chosenthem to be the edification of many others, especially in thesedays, when the friends of God should be strong, in order thatthey may support the weak.  Those who discern in themselves thisgrace, must look upon themselves as such friends, if they wouldfulfil the law which even the honourable friendship of the worldrespects; if not, as I said just now, [9] let them fear andtremble, lest they should be doing mischief to themselves--andGod grant it be to themselves only!9. What the soul has to do at those seasons wherein it is raisedto the prayer of quiet is nothing more than to be gentle andwithout noise.  By noise, I mean going about with theunderstanding in search of words and reflections whereby to giveGod thanks for this grace, and heaping up its sins andimperfections together to show that it does not deserve it.All this commotion takes place now, and the understanding comesforward, and the memory is restless, and certainly to me thesepowers bring much weariness at times; for, though my memory isnot strong, I cannot control it.  Let the will quietly and wiselyunderstand that it is not by dint of labour on our part that wecan converse to any good purpose with God, and that our ownefforts are only great logs of wood, laid on without discretionto quench this little spark; and let it confess this, and inhumility say, O Lord, what can I do here? what has the servant todo with her Lord, and earth with heaven? or words of love thatsuggest themselves now, firmly grounded in the conviction thatwhat it says is truth; and let it make no account of theunderstanding, which is simply tiresome.10. And if the will wishes to communicate to the understandingany portion of that the fruition of which itself has entered on,or if it labours to make the understanding recollected, it shallnot succeed; for it will often happen that the will is in unionand at rest, while the understanding is in extreme disorder.It is better for it to leave it alone, and not to run after it--Iam speaking of the will; for the will should abide in thefruition of that grace, recollected itself, like the prudent bee;for if no bees entered the hive, and each of them wandered abroadin search of the rest, the honey would hardly be made.  In thesame way, the soul will lose much if it be not careful now,especially if the understanding be acute; for when it begins tomake reflections and search for reasons, it will think at oncethat it is doing something if its reasons and reflectionsare good.11. The only reason that ought to be admitted now is tounderstand clearly that there is no reason whatever, except Hismere goodness, why God should grant us so great a grace, and tobe aware that we are so near Him, and to pray to His Majesty formercies, to make intercession for the Church, for those who hadbeen recommended to us, and for the souls in purgatory,--not,however, with noise of words, but with a heartfelt desire to beheard.  This is a prayer that contains much, and by it more isobtained than by many reflections of the understanding.  Let thewill stir up some of those reasons, which proceed from reasonitself, to quicken its love, such as the fact of its being in abetter state, and let it make certain acts of love, as what itwill do for Him to whom it owes so much,--and that, as I saidjust now, without any noise of the understanding, in the searchafter profound reflections.  A little straw,--and it will be lessthan straw, if we bring it ourselves,--laid on with humility,will be more effectual here, and will help to kindle a fire morethan many fagots of most learned reasons, which, in my opinion,will put it out in a moment.12. This is good for those learned men who have commanded me towrite, [10] and who all, by the goodness of God, have come tothis state; for it may be that they spend the time in makingapplications of passages of the Scriptures.  And though learningcould not fail to be of great use to them, both before and afterprayer, still, in the very time of prayer itself, there is littlenecessity for it, in my opinion, unless it be for the purpose ofmaking the will tepid; for the understanding then, because of itsnearness to the light, is itself illuminated; so that even I, whoam what I am, seem to be a different person.  And so it is; forit has happened to me, who scarcely understand a word of what Iread in Latin, and specially in the Psalms, when in the prayer ofquiet, not only to understand the Latin as if it were Spanish,but, still more, to take a delight in dwelling on the meaning ofthat I knew through the Spanish.  We must make an exception: ifthese learned men have to preach or to teach, they will do wellto take advantage of their learning, that they may help poorpeople of little learning, of whom I am one.  Charity is a greatthing; and so always is ministering unto souls, when done simplyfor God.13. So, then, when the soul is in the prayer of quiet, let itrepose in its rest--let learning be put on one side.  The timewill come when they may make use of it in the service of ourLord--when they that possess it will appreciate it so highly asto be glad that they had not neglected it even for all thetreasures of the world, simply because it enables them to serveHis Majesty; for it is a great help.  But in the eyes of InfiniteWisdom, believe me, a little striving after humility, and asingle act thereof, are worth more than all the science in theworld.  This is not the time for discussing, but forunderstanding plainly what we are, and presenting ourselves insimplicity before God, who will have the soul make itself as afool--as, indeed, it is--in His presence, seeing that His Majestyso humbles Himself as to suffer it to be near Him, we being whatwe are.14. Moreover, the understanding bestirs itself to make itsthanksgiving in phrases well arranged; but the will, in peace,not daring to lift up its eyes with the publican, [11] makesperhaps a better act of thanksgiving than the understanding, withall the tropes of its rhetoric.  In a word, mental prayer is notto be abandoned altogether now, nor even vocal prayer, if at anytime we wish, or can, to make use of either of them; for if thestate of quiet be profound, it becomes difficult to speak, and itcan be done only with great pain.15. I believe myself that we know whether this proceeds from theSpirit of God, or is brought about by endeavours of our own, inthe commencement of devotion which God gives; and we seek ofourselves, as I said before, [12] to pass onwards to this quietof the will.  Then, no effect whatever is produced; it is quicklyover, and aridity is the result.  If it comes from Satan, thepractised soul, in my opinion, will detect it, because it leavestrouble behind, and scant humility and poor dispositions forthose effects which are wrought if it comes from God; it leavesneither light in the understanding nor steadiness inthe truth. [13]16. Here Satan can do little or no harm, if the soul directs untoGod the joy and sweetness it then feels; and if it fixes thethoughts and desires on Him, according to the advice alreadygiven, the devil can gain nothing whatever--on the contrary, bythe permission of God, he will lose much by that very joy whichhe causes in the soul, because that joy will help the soul,inasmuch as it thinks the joy comes from God, to betake itselfoften to prayer in its desire for it.  And if the soul is humble,indifferent to, and detached from, all joy, however spiritual,and if it loves the cross, it will make no account of thesweetness which Satan sends.  But it cannot so deal with thatwhich comes from the Spirit of God; of that it will make much.Now, when Satan sends it, as he is nothing but a lie, and when hesees that the soul humbles itself through that joy andsweetness--and here, in all things relating to prayer andsweetness, we must be very careful to endeavour to make ourselveshumble,--Satan will not often repeat his work, when he sees thathe loses by it.17. For this and for many other reasons, when I was speaking ofthe first degree of prayer, and of the first method of drawingthe water, [14] I insisted upon it that the great affair of soulsis, when they begin to pray, to begin also to detach themselvesfrom every kind of joy, and to enter on it resolved only onhelping to carry the cross of Christ like good soldiers, willingto serve their King without present pay, because they are sure ofit at last, having their eyes directed to the true andeverlasting kingdom at the conquest of which we are aiming.18. It is a very great matter to have this always before oureyes, especially in the beginning; afterwards, it becomes soclear, that it is rather a matter of necessity to forget it, inorder to live on.  Now, labouring to keep in mind that all thingshere below are of short duration, that they are all nothing, thatthe rest we have here is to be accounted as none,--all this, Isay, seems to be exceedingly low; and so, indeed, it is,--becausethose who have gone on to greater perfection would look upon itas a reproach, and be ashamed of themselves, if they thought thatthey were giving up the goods of this world because they areperishable, or that they would not be glad to give them up forGod--even if they were to last for ever.  The greater theperfection of these persons, the greater their joy, and thegreater also would that joy be if the duration of these worldlygoods were greater.19. In these persons, thus far advanced, love is already grown,and love is that which does this work.  But as to beginners, tothem it is of the utmost importance, and they must not regardthis consideration as unbecoming, for the blessings to be gainedare great,--and that is why I recommend it so much to them; forthey will have need of it--even those who have attained to greatheights of prayer--at certain times, when God will try them, andwhen His Majesty seems to have forsaken them.20. I have said as much already, and I would not have itforgotten, [15] in this our life on earth, the growth of the soulis not like that of the body.  We, however, so speak of it--and,in truth, it does grow.  A youth that is grown up, whose body isformed, and who is become a man, does not ungrow, nor does hisbody lessen in size; but as to the soul, it so is by our Lord'swill, so far as I have seen it in my own experience,--but I knownothing of it in any other way.  It must be in order to humble usfor our greater good, and to keep us from being careless duringour exile; seeing that he who has ascended the higher has themore reason to be afraid, and to be less confident in himself.A time may come when they whose will is so wrapt up in the willof God--and who, rather than fall into a single imperfection,would undergo torture and suffer a thousand deaths--will find itnecessary, if they would be delivered from offending God, andfrom the commission of sin, to make use of the first armour ofprayer, to call to mind how everything is coming to an end, thatthere is a heaven and a hell, and to make use of otherreflections of that nature, when they find themselves assailed bytemptations and persecutions.21. Let us go back to what I was saying.  The great source of ourdeliverance from the cunning devices and the sweetness whichSatan sends is to begin with a resolution to walk in the way ofthe Cross from the very first, and not to desire any sweetness atall, seeing that our Lord Himself has pointed out to us the wayof perfection, saying, 'Take up thy cross and follow Me.' [16]He is our example; and whosoever follows His counsels only toplease Him has nothing to fear.  In the improvement which theydetect in themselves, they who do so will see that this is nowork of Satan and if they fall, they have a sign of the presenceof our Lord in their rising again at once.  They have othersigns, also, of which I am going to speak.22. When it is the work of the Spirit of God, there is nonecessity for going about searching for reasons, on the strengthof which we may elicit acts of humility and of shame, because ourLord Himself supplies them in a way very different from that bywhich we could acquire them by our own poor reflections, whichare as nothing in comparison with that real humility arising outof the light which our Lord here gives us, and which begets aconfusion of face that undoes us.  The knowledge with which Godsupplies us, in order that we may know that of ourselves we haveno good in us, is perfectly apprehended--and the more perfectly,the greater the graces.  It fills us with a great desire ofadvancing in prayer, and of never giving it up, whatever troublesmay arise.  The soul offers to suffer everything.  A certainsecurity, joined with humility and fear concerning our salvation,casts out servile fear at once from the soul, and in its placeplants a loyal fear [17] of more perfect growth. [18]  There is avisible beginning of a love of God, utterly divested of allself-interest, together with a longing after seasons of solitude,in order to obtain a greater fruition of this good.23. In short, not to weary myself, it is the beginning of allgood; the flowers have so thriven, that they are on the point ofbudding.  And this the soul sees most clearly, and it isimpossible to persuade it now that God was not with it, till itturns back upon itself, and beholds its own failings andimperfections.  Then it fears for everything; and it is well itshould do so--though there are souls whom the certain convictionthat God is with them benefits more than all the fear they mayever have.  If a soul love greatly, and is thankful naturally,the remembrance of the mercies of God makes it turn to Him moreeffectually than all the chastisements of hell it can everpicture to itself--at least, it was so with me, though I amso wicked.24. As I shall speak at greater length of the signs of a goodspirit [19]--it has cost me much labour to be clear about them--Ido not treat of them here.  I believe, too, that, with the helpof God, I shall be able to speak somewhat to the point,because--setting aside the experience I have had, and by which Ilearned much--I have had the help of some most learned men andpersons of great holiness, whom we may reasonably believe in thematter. Souls, therefore, are not to weary themselves so much asI did, when, by the goodness of our Lord, they may have come tothis state.1.
